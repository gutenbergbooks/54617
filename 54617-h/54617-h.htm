<h3>MR. TENNYSON’S QUEEN MARY.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h3>

<p>Mr. Tennyson has achieved a
great reputation as a lyric poet.
He urges now a higher claim. In
the sunset of a not inglorious life,
when we should have expected his
lute to warble with waning melodies
and less impassioned strains, he
lays it aside as too feeble for his maturer
inspirations, and, as though renewed
with the fire of a second
youth, he draws to his bosom a
nobler instrument, and awakes the
echoes of sublimer chords. He
has grown weary of the lyric</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“hœrentem multa cum laude coronam,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and with some confidence claims
the dramatic bays. Nay, he even
invites a comparison with Shakspere.
True to the temper of the
times, his prestige follows him in
so hazardous a competition, the
accustomed wreaths are showered
upon him with unreflecting haste,
and the facile representatives of
the most incapable of critics&mdash;public
opinion&mdash;have already offered
him that homage as a dramatist
which had already been too lavishly
offered to his idyllic muse.</p>

<p>It is an ungrateful task to go
against the popular current, and it
is an ungracious one to object to
crowns which the multitude have
decreed. But there is no help for it,
unless we would stoop to that criticism
of prestige which is so characteristic
of the age, and would follow
in the wake of the literary rabble,
criticising the works by the
author, instead of the author by his
works.</p>

<p>We may as well say, at once, that
we have never felt it in our power
to acknowledge the poetical supremacy
of the English poet-laureate.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
It has always appeared to
us that there is, in his poetry, a
lack of inspiration. To borrow a
too familiar but expressive metaphor,
the coin is highly burnished,
glitters brightly, and has the current
stamp, but one misses the ring of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the genuine metal. He sits patiently
on the tripod, dealing forth
phrases as musical as Anacreon’s
numbers, and as polished as those
of a Greek sophist, spiced with a
refined humor, which has a special
charm of its own. But his soul
does not kindle at the sacred
fire. We miss the divine frenzy.
A passionateness of love of the
beautiful does not appear to be the
quickening inspiration of his creations.
All alike show signs of extreme
care and preparation. We
do not forget the counsel of Horace.
But that only refers to a
distant revision of creations which
an unchecked genius may have produced
under the divine influence.
Whereas, Mr. Tennyson’s poetry
bears evidence of infinite toil
in production. All his thoughts,
ideas, and images, down to words
and phrases, are too evidently, instead
of the happy inspirations of
genius, the labored workmanship
of a polished, refined, and fastidious
mind. They something resemble
the <i lang="fr">tout ensemble</i> of a <i lang="fr">petit
maître</i> who has succeeded in conveying
to his dress an appearance
of such consummate simplicity and
unexceptionable taste that every
one notices the result of hours before
the mirror. His diction is
pure and polished, his phrases simple
and nervous, and the English
language owes him much for what
he has done towards neutralizing the
injury inflicted on it by the gaudy
phraseology of the “correct” poets,
and the antithetical sesquipedalianism
of such prose writers as Johnson
and Gibbon, and for preserving it
in its pure and nervous simplicity.
But his soul is dull to the poetic
meanings of nature. His natural
scenery is rather descriptive than a
creation, much as artists, of whom
there are not a few, who reproduce
with consummate skill of imitation
objects in detail, and bestow infinite
care upon color, shade, perspective,
grouping, and all the other
technical details of a picture, whilst
comparatively indifferent to the
subject, which ought to be the poetic
meaning of creations of genius.
And what are they but only fruitful
manifestations of the love of
the beautiful, and echoes of its
creative word, not the mere manipulations
of an artificer? Mr.
Tennyson’s descriptions of nature
owe their vividness to the brilliance
of word-painting and a certain refined
delicacy of touch; sometimes,
even, and indeed very often, to a
certain quaint humor which is inconsistent
with the highest art&mdash;it
is not a passionate love which regards
the object beloved from a
ridiculous point of view&mdash;as when
he describes the willows living
adown the banks of a streamlet as
“shock-headed pollards <i lang="fr">poussetting</i>
down the stream.”</p>

<p>The sensations provoked by his
poetry resemble those of one who
has sauntered through a museum
of precious stones of rare workmanship
and purest water. Our
æsthetic taste has been pleased by
the glitter and the color and the
brilliance, but our mind and heart
have not been deeply moved. His
poems are ablaze with detached
thoughts of lofty meaning, and of
a multitude of others whose meaning
is not obvious, all alike expressed
in vivid imagery, in the
purest phraseology, and in rare
melody of rhythm. But they are
confused and cabalistic. He seems
to be always laboring to be incomprehensible.
He calls it “the riddling
of the bards.” And he succeeds.
The problem of the Sphinx,
the emblematic warning sent by the
Scythians to their Persian invader,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
the mute counsel sent by the Samian
to the Corinthian tyrant, a Delphic
oracle, all were clear and easy
by comparison with Mr. Tennyson’s
lyrics, alike in detached passages
and in entire poems. None of woman
born can fathom the meaning
of the <cite>Idylls of the King</cite>.</p>

<p>This defect alone is fatal to poetry.
So keenly did Spenser feel it
that although the meaning of his
allegory, <cite>The Faerie Queene</cite>, is obvious
enough to any ordinary intelligence,
he is careful to explain it
in full in a letter dedicated to Sir
Walter Raleigh.</p>

<p>Mr. Tennyson, on the contrary,
involves himself in the thickest
mystery he can contrive, and expects
his worshippers to take it for
inspiration. Take the following,
for example, from “The Coming
of Arthur”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Rain, rain, and sun, a rainbow in the sky!</div>
<div class="verse indent1">A young man will be wiser by-and-by,</div>
<div class="verse">An old man’s wit may wander e’er he die.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Rain, rain, and sun, a rainbow on the lea!</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And truth is this to me, and that to thee</div>
<div class="verse">And truth, or clothed or naked, let it be.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Rain, sun, and rain! and the free blossom blows,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Sun, rain, and sun! and where is he who knows?</div>
<div class="verse">From the great deep to the great deep he goes.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These are, no doubt, “riddling
triplets,” as he himself calls them.
The riddling of Shakspere’s fools,
even the wanderings from the night
of distraught Ophelia’s brain, are
light itself by the side of them.
We may well echo his invocation
of “Sun, rain, and sun! and
where is he who knows?” Whatever
inspiration may be evident
here, it is not that of the beautiful.
And yet even this has snatches of
meaning which many passages we
might adduce have not; as the
following, from “Gareth and Lynette”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Know ye not, then, the riddling of the bards?</div>
<div class="verse">Confusion, and illusion, and relation.</div>
<div class="verse">Elusion, and occasion, and evasion?”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is almost a pity that the bard
did not complete his “riddling”
while he was about it. Another
couplet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Diffusion, and ablution, and abrasion.</div>
<div class="verse">Ablution, expectation, botheration,</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">would have rendered still more impenetrable
the bardic mystery.</p>

<p>There is no resemblance in this
studied concealment of meaning, if
meaning there be, to that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent4">“Sacred madness of the bards</div>
<div class="verse">When God makes music through them,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">of which he sings. It is more like
the melodious confusion of the
Æolian harp. Even if the poet
have a definite meaning in his own
mind, if he so express it that I
cannot even guess it, to me it is
nonsense; and nonsense, however
melodious, although it may enchant
my sense, cannot move my heart.
Here and there, however, our poet
sings snatches of real poetry, as
Sir Bedivere’s answer to his king
in “The Coming of Arthur”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I heard the water lapping on the craig</div>
<div class="verse">And the long ripple washing in the reeds.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Upon the whole, Mr. Tennyson
excels in a certain underlying vein
of exquisitely refined humor. And
when his subject admits of it, he
is unrivalled. His is the poetry of
humor. We would name as examples
“The Northern Farmer” and
the satirical poem, “Locksley Hall,”
perhaps the most vigorous of all
his productions; and, of his longer
poems, <cite>The Princess</cite>. It is for this
reason we think he is more likely
to excel, as a dramatist, in comedy
than in tragedy.</p>

<p>If our readers would estimate the
full force of our remarks, we would
invite them to read the works of
any of the principal of our earlier
lyrical poets, as, for example, Collins.
We name him because he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
too excels in that melody of versification
for which Mr. Tennyson is
so distinguished. At times, as in his
“Sonnet on Evening,” he surpasses
the Laureate in that respect, although
for sustained and unfailing
rhythmical melody the latter bears
away the palm from him, and perhaps
from every other rival. But
in profound sympathy with nature,
in the fidelity of his creations, in
the echoes of the beautiful which
he provokes within the soul of the
reader, the Poet-Laureate must
yield to the Demy of Magdalen.
Like Shakspere, he peopled inanimate
nature with a fairy world, and
amongst elves and genii and other
dainty spirits he abandoned himself
to that power of impersonation
which is almost an attribute of
a true poet.</p>

<p>Our space does not admit of illustrative
quotations, but we would
refer the reader inclined to institute
the comparison suggested to the
elegy over Fidele, in the play of
<cite>Cymbeline</cite>, and to his <cite>Eclogues</cite>.</p>

<p>Mr. Tennyson’s poetry has beauties
of its own peculiar kind of so
remarkable and striking a description
that we might have hesitated
to take any exceptions whatsoever
to his poetical genius. But his new
poem, his first effort in dramatic
poetry, seems to us to set all doubt
at rest. It convinces us that, for
whatever reasons, of the highest
flights of poetic inspiration Mr.
Tennyson is incapable. We are
convinced that he lacks that which
constitutes a great poet. However
beautiful his poetry, we feel that
it wants something which, however
keenly we may be sensible of it, it
is not easy either to analyze or explain.</p>

<p>For what is the inspiration of
poetry but the echoes of the beautiful
within the soul of man? The
universe of things is the visible
word of God. It is his essential
beauty projected by an energy of
creative love&mdash;the quickening spirit
opening his wings over chaos&mdash;into
an objective existence, on which
its generator looked with complacency
as “very good,” and which
he generated in order that his
creature, whom he had made in
his own image, might, with himself,
rejoice in its contemplation.
He did not, at first, endow him
with the power of beholding himself
“face to face,” but only his
reflex. We have the right to believe
that, whilst in union with his
Maker, he read at a glance the
meaning of the word, he felt instantaneously
the beauty of the
image. His nature, into which no
discord had as yet been introduced,
uncondemned to the judgment of
painful toil, did not acquire charity
and knowledge by long and laborious
processes, disciplinary and ratiocinative,
but by intuition. Incapable
as yet of the Beatific Vision,
he comprehended the whole of
the divine beauty as revealed in
creation, and the comprehension itself
was a transport of love. He
saw, and knew, and loved, and the
three were one simultaneous energy
of the sonship of his nature.
But, as now, “the greatest of these
was charity.” It was the result
and sum and end of the sight and
knowledge. It was the feeling they
inevitably and unremittingly occasioned.
To speak as we can only
speak in our actual condition, it
was as those thuds of loving admiration
with which our hearts throb
when we look upon some surpassing
embodiment of innocent and
modest female loveliness. When
the mind, jealous of pre-eminence,
led captive, so to speak, the heart
in revolt against the revealed law,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the human being was no longer in
union with himself, a war of impulses
and of energies was set up
within him, the image of God was
defaced, his perception of created
beauty became more and more obscure
as he went further away from
his original abode of innocence,
until, finally, it was all but lost.
The emotion, if we may describe it
as such, which it was of its nature
to suggest, could not perish, for it is
imperishable. But it had lost its
true object, and surveyed knowledge
in a form more or less degraded.</p>

<p>Now out of this very faint and
rapid sketch of a psychological
theory which would require a volume
for its development, we hope
to be able to convey some idea,
however vague, of the nature of the
poetic spirit.</p>

<p>It is certain that the remains of
the divine image have not since
been alike and equal in all the individuals
of the race. It may be
asserted, on the contrary, that there
are no two human microcosms in
which the elements of the confusion
introduced into them by the original
infidelity exist in the same proportion.
Those in whom the intelligence
is the quickest to see, and
the mind, heart, and soul to love in
unison, the image of divine beauty
revealed in creation&mdash;those, that is,
in whom the divine image remains
the most pronouncedly&mdash;are the
truest poets.</p>

<p>When this echo of the soul to the
beautiful does not go beyond the
physical creation, the inspirations
of love express themselves in lyric
or idyllic poetry. The poet imitates
the divine Creator in reproducing,
even creating, images of his lower
creation so faithful and suggestive
that they who look upon them experience
similar sensations and emotions
to those provoked within them
by the divine creation itself, nay, not
unseldom, even profounder ones.
He reveals the beautiful in similar
images to those in which The Beautiful
revealed himself to his creature;
he is thus himself a ποιητὴς, or
creator, and his work is a ποίησις,
or creation. When his forms derive
their inspiration only from the inferior
creation, they are exclusively
some form of idyls or lyrics. But
when, soaring above the grosser
medium of the merely material universe,
and poising himself on wings
tremulous with reverent joy at the
confines of the invisible, his soul
echoes the music of the beautiful
issuing from that invisible creation;
and that imitative energy which is
of its essence, inspired by these reawakening
inspirations, calls into
being psychical individualities with
their precise bodily expression and
proper destinies&mdash;that is to say,
with all the causes and results,
ebb and flow, action and reaction,
in human affairs, of every volition
and energy, he reproduces the
highest energy of the divine creative
power, he evokes into sensible
existence whole multitudes of fresh
creatures made in the image of God,
and, what is even yet more sublime,
he evokes into equally sensible being
the particular providence which
overrules each and all&mdash;the one
difference between the two creations
being that one is original, the other
imitative; one imaginary&mdash;that is,
<em>merely</em> sensible; the other, not only
sensible, but <em>real</em> also, and <em>essential</em>.
Yet are the accidents of the former
produced occasionally with such
extraordinary fidelity that they
have sometimes, as in the creations
of Shakspere, for example, the same
effect upon those who become acquainted
with them as if they were
in truth the latter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Who that has ever studied the
creations of that immortal dramatist
has not them all, from high
to low, treasured within his inner
being as vividly as any other of his
absent acquaintances, whom he has
met in society, to whom he has been
formally introduced, with whom he
has eaten, drank, laughed, wept,
walked, and conversed? Has not
that remarkable genius transgressed
even the imitative faculty&mdash;imitative,
that is, of all the original creative
energy that is known&mdash;produced
original creations, and peopled
the preter- rather than supernatural
with beings which have no known
existence, but whom nevertheless
he surrounds with a distinct verisimilitude
which ensures them easy
admission into our minds and
hearts, which presents them to our
senses as concrete beings with as
much positiveness, and even as
clearly defined individuality, as if
they were solid creatures of flesh
and bone, and which makes us
feel that if such beings did really
exist, they would be none other
than precisely those he has represented?</p>

<p>Of such sort, we take it, is the
highest, or dramatic, poetry. And
of it there is a manifest deficiency
in this work, which its author terms,
indeed, a drama, but which is in
fact a tragedy.</p>

<p>Mr. Tennyson has not enough of
the divine afflatus to write tragedy.
If he has not sufficient love of the
beautiful in inanimate nature for
his soul to echo to it, and his heart
to throb with the sense of it, with
the rapidity of an intuition, so as to
make unattainable to him the highest
excellence in lyric poetry, how
much more out of his reach must be
a first rank in the tragic drama;
where, if anywhere, an intuition of
the beautiful amounting to an inspiration
is demanded in that supreme
creation of God which, as
the consummation of his “work”
and word, he has embodied in
his own substance! In that profound
and intuitive perception of
the workings of man’s inner being,
of the passions, emotions, feelings,
appetites, their action and reaction,
ebb and flow; of the struggle of the
two natures, its infinite variety and
play of life, under all conceivable
conditions and vicissitudes,
with much more than can be
detailed here included in these,
Mr. Tennyson is strikingly deficient.</p>

<p>In the tragedies of Shakspere,
as in all his dramas, the distinct
personality of every one of the
characters, high and low, is impressed
upon us with vivid distinctness.
But the principal personages in the
tragedies dilate before us in heroic
proportions as the portentous struggle
progresses. Whether it be
King Lear, or King John, or King
Richard, or Othello, or Lady Macbeth,
or Lady Constance, or the
widowed Princess of Wales, or
Ophelia, or whoever else, we look
on with bated breath, as did the
spectators of the boat-race with
which Æneas celebrated the suicide
of his regal paramour, and we come
away at its close a prey to the
storm of emotions which the magic
art of the island sorcerer has conjured
up within us.</p>

<p>But the drama, or tragedy, as we
prefer to call it, we read with but languid
interest. The psychical struggle
is neither very obvious nor very
critical, there is no very striking
revelation of the sublime beauty or
tragic overthrow of human nature,
and although the canvas is crowded
with figures, not one of them impresses
any very distinct image of
his or her individuality on our mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and heart. Instead of, as Shakspere’s
creations, retaining every
one of them as a distinct and intimate
acquaintance, whom we may
summon into our company at will,
we rise from the perusal of <cite>Queen
Mary</cite> without having received any
very definite impression of any,
even the principal, personages, and
we forget all about them almost as
soon as we have read the play.</p>

<p>This vital defect in a drama the
author has rendered doubly fatal
through his having carried his imitation
of Shakspere to the extent
of adopting his simplicity of plot.
Shakspere could afford to do this.
The inspired verisimilitude of the
struggle of the two natures in every
one of his human creations, the
profoundness of his development
of the innermost working of the
human microcosm, often by a few
master-touches, surround every one
of his <i lang="la">dramatis personæ</i> with all the
rapt suspense and sustained interest
of a plot. Every one of his characters
is, as it were, a plot in itself.
But it is quite certain that Mr. Tennyson&mdash;and
it is no depreciation of
him&mdash;has not this power. He has,
therefore, every right to call to his
aid the interest of an elaborate plot,
which itself would also, we think,
cause him to develop more vividly
his characters. It is in this the
late Lord Lytton, whose poetical
pretensions are very much below
Mr. Tennyson’s, achieved whatever
success he had as a dramatist. Mr.
Tennyson has not to depend on
this solely, as was very nearly the
case with Lord Lytton, but it would
contribute very much to a higher
success. The great dramatist he is
unwise enough so avowedly to imitate
peoples the simplest plot with
a whole world of stirring destinies.
He moves his quickening wand,
and lo! as by the master-will of a
creator, appear a Hamlet or a
Malvolio, a Lady Macbeth or a
Goneril or Miranda, an Ariel or a
Caliban, contribute their precise
share to the history, which would
not have been complete without
them, and then disappear from the
scene, but never from our memory.
A magic word or two has smitten
them into <em>it</em>, and they live for aye
in our mind and heart. His heroes
and his heroines he clothes with
such a majesty of poetry that we
watch anxiously with bated breath
their every gesture, word, or look;
we cannot bear their absence, until,
entranced into their destiny, and
half unconscious, we watch them
disappear in the catastrophe, our
ears are blank, all voices mute, the
brilliant theatre is the chamber of
death, and they who, to us, were
but now living flesh and blood, in
whose destinies our innermost soul
was rapt, have passed away, amidst
a tempest of emotions, and are no
more.</p>

<p>But Thucydides’ <cite>History of the
Peloponnesian War</cite>, either of the two
great classic epics, or any striking
historic passage in even so ungraphic
a writer as Lingard, is more
dramatic than this drama. The
feeble plot gives birth to feebler
impersonations. They come and
go without making any deep impression
upon us, or seizing our attention
by any striking originality.
Their features are indistinct, their
actions insignificant. They are
bloodless and colorless. They are
ghosts, things of air, whom a feeble
incantation has summoned from
their slumber, who mutter a few
laborious Spartanisms in a renewed
life in which they seem to have no
concern, and vanish without provoking
a regret, nor even an emotion.
We observe in them such an
absence of verisimilitude, so marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
a want of truth to nature, as very
much to weaken, when it does not
entirely destroy, the dramatic illusion.
Nowhere is this more observable
than where he intends
most manifestly a rivalry of Shakspere.
Shakspere not unseldom
introduces the multitude into his
poetic history. But when he does
so, it seizes our interest as forcibly
as his more important personages.
With a few rapid touches he dashes
in a few typical individuals, who
reveal to us vividly what the whole
kind of thing is of which they are
prominent units. They are the
mob of the very time and place to
which they belong. Whether at
Rome in the time of Julius Cæsar,
or at Mantua or Verona in the Middle
Ages, or in England during the
time of the Tudors, we feel that
they act and speak just as then and
there they might have said and
done. Every one, too, has his or
her distinct individuality. And
such a verisimilitude have they that
even an occasional anachronism,
such as, in <cite>Troilus and Cressida</cite>,
making a Trojan servant talk of
<em>being in the state of grace</em>, does not
dispel the charm. But Mr. Tennyson’s
mob-types have no more striking
features to seize our interest
than his more exalted creations,
whilst his anachronisms are of a
kind which send all verisimilitude
to the winds. Joan and Tib, and the
four or five citizens, have nothing
in them for which they should be
singled out of the very ordinary condition
of life to which they belong.
And we are tempted to sneer when
we hear an Elizabethan mob talking
like Hampshire or Yorkshire peasants
of the present day.</p>

<p>For all that, Mr. Tennyson’s
cockneys and rustics are not his
most ineffective portraiture. We
experience a slight sensation of their
having been lugged in, perhaps because
of the inevitable comparison
with Shakspere they provoke, and
we feel them to be too modern;
but the poet’s sense of humor here
serves him in good stead, and although,
in this respect, immeasurably
below Shakspere, he gives a
kind of raciness to his plebeians
which saves them from being an
absolute failure.</p>

<p>It is, however, in the principal
personages of the drama that we
most miss the Promethean fire,
and pre-eminently in the hero, if
Cranmer is intended for such a
dignity, and the heroine. Amongst
these, the most lifelike are Courtenay
and Sir Thomas Wyatt; because,
in their creation, the peculiar
vein of quaint irony and exceedingly
refined humor, which is
Mr. Tennyson’s most eminent distinction,
comes to his aid. For the
rest, up to the heroine herself and
the canting and recanting Cranmer,
they are colorless and bloodless.
We scarcely know one from the
other. And we do not care to.
Noailles and Renard are but poor
specimens of diplomatists. Their
sovereigns, were the time the present,
might pick up a dozen such
any day in Wall Street. If the
poet could embody no greater conception
of two such men as Bonner
and Gardiner than a couple
of vulgar, self-seeking, blood-thirsty
knaves, he should have dispensed
altogether with their presence. He
should have given to them some
elevation, whatever history may say
about it. A drama is a poem, not
a history; and the poet may take
the names of historic personages
and, within certain limits, fit to
them creations of his own. In Cardinal
Pole he had an opportunity
for a noble ideal. But all we have
is an amiable dummy, an old gentleman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
as ordinary and ineffective
as the rest.</p>

<p>Facts have been so distorted by
the influence which for so long had
sole possession of literature, that
there is plenty of room for taking
great liberties with history. Mr.
Tennyson has slightly availed himself
of this, but in the wrong direction.
Shakspere himself could not
have made a saint of Cranmer. For
poetry, there was nothing for it but
to make him a more splendid sinner.
To retain all his littlenesses
and to array them in seductive virtues,
is to present us with some
such figure as the dusky chieftains
decked in gaudy tinsel that solicit
our admiration in front of the tobacconists’
shops. To attempt to
give heroic proportions to a man
whose profession of faith followed
subserviently his self-interest until
no hope remained, and then place
in the hands of the burning criminal
the palm of martyrdom, is to
invite the love within us of the
beautiful and the true to echo to
a psychical impossibility, and
that without an element of greatness.</p>

<p>Yet had the front figure of the
history been a noble conception
grandly executed all this might have
been condoned. One might well
have looked at them as a few rough
accessories to heighten by their
contrast the beauty of the central
form. There was place for a splendid
creation. No more favorable
material for a tragic heroine exists
than Mary Tudor&mdash;with the single
exception of that other Mary who
fell beneath the Puritans like a lily
before the scythe of the destroyer.
Around her history and person circle
all the elements of the tenderest
pathos, which is of the very essence
of tragedy. That Shakspere did
not use them is a proof he thought
so. For “the fair vestal throned in
the west” would have resented such
a creation as his quickening genius
would have called to life. A queen
of noble nature gradually swept
away by a resistless current of untoward
circumstances, is a history
capable of the sublimity of a Greek
catastrophe, with the added pathos
of Christian suffering. But who
have we here? A silly woman, devoutly
pious, and endowed with a
conspicuous share of the family
courage. But she is so weak that
her piety has the appearance of superstition,
and her fits of courage
lose their royalty and fail to rescue
her from contempt. Unattractive
in person, she falls desperately in
love with a man much younger than
herself, and her woman’s love, ordinarily
so quick to detect coldness
in a lover, is blind to the grossest
neglect; and yet not so blind but
that a few words scrawled on a rag
of paper, dropped in her way, could
open her eyes on the spot. The
tenderness of her love and the
importunity of cruel-minded men,
transform her almost suddenly from
a gentle-natured woman to an unrelenting
human tigress. And she,
who would not allow the law to
take its course on her most dangerous
enemies, can exclaim of her
sister Elizabeth,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent6">“To the Tower with <em>her</em>!</div>
<div class="verse">My foes are at my feet, and I am queen.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Afterwards of Guilford Dudley, the
Duke of Suffolk, and Lady Jane
Grey&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“They shall die.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And again of her sister&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent12">“She shall die.</div>
<div class="verse">My foes are at my feet, and Philip king.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is not the grandness of crime,
as in Richard III., or even in Lady
Macbeth. It is the petty despotism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of a weak and silly woman.
There is no greatness of any kind
about it. It is the mere triumphant
chuckle of an amorous queen, wooing
a more than indifferent husband.
It is little&mdash;little enough for a
comedy. There is something approaching
the tragic in the desolation
of her last moments. Calais is
lost, her husband hates her, her
people hate her. But the poet has
already robbed her of the dignity
of her position. She has forfeited
our esteem. We experience an ordinary
sympathy with her. But her
fate is only what was to be expected.
And the highest pathos is
out of the question. When, following
the example of her injured mother
in the play of <cite>Henry VIII.</cite>,
she betakes herself to lute and song,
the author insists on a comparison
with Shakspere, and beside the full
notes of the Bard of Avon the
petty treble of the Laureate pipe
shrinks to mediocrity.</p>

<p>But the most unpardonable of
Mr. Tennyson’s imitations of Shakspere
are those in which he rings
the changes on the celebrated passage
about “no Italian priest shall
tithe nor toll in our dominions,”
which inevitably provokes the applause
of those amongst a theatrical
audience who do not know what it
means&mdash;unpardonable, because it
makes even Shakspere himself as
ridiculous as a poor travesty cannot
fail to do. He was content
with one such passage throughout
his many plays. If Terence
had filtered the noble sentiment
of his celebrated passage,
“Ego homo sum, et nihil humanum
a me alienum,” through a variety
of forms, it would have excited the
laughter instead of the plaudits of
the Roman “gods.” But the author
of <cite>Queen Mary</cite> is not afraid to
pose <em>his</em> sentiment, itself borrowed
in no less than three different attitudes
in one play; committing
the additional absurdity of thrusting
it, like a quid of tobacco, into
the cheek of two different personages.
Gardiner uses it twice, Elizabeth
once:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent4">“Yet I know well [says the former]</div>
<div class="verse">Your people …</div>
<div class="verse">Will brook nor Pope nor Spaniard here to play</div>
<div class="verse">The tyrant, or in commonwealth or church”;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and again, with questionable taste:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“And see you, we shall have to <em>dodge</em> again,</div>
<div class="verse">And let the Pope trample our rights, and plunge</div>
<div class="verse">His <em>foreign fist</em> into our island church,</div>
<div class="verse">To plump the leaner pouch of Italy”;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">whilst Elizabeth is made to vulgarize
it beyond hope of redemption
into a mere petty ebullition of
splenetic womanly vanity:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Then, Queen indeed! No foreign prince or priest</div>
<div class="verse">Should fill my throne, myself upon the steps.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It must be owned, indeed, that
this play lacks the highest poetry
in its expression as much as in its
conception. We occasionally come
across passages of vivid and vigorous
limning, as Count Feria’s reply
to Elizabeth towards the end of the
play, and Howard’s description to
the Lord Mayor of the state of
mind of the citizens. But even the
force of this latter passage is not
dramatic. There is none of the
rush and movement of an excited
populace. There are a few striking
groups. But they are inactive.
Theirs is a kind of dead life, if we
may be pardoned such an expression.
Rather, they are mere <i lang="fr">tableaux
vivants</i>. They inspire us with
no fear for Mary’s throne. More
near to dramatic power and beauty
is Elizabeth’s soliloquy at Woodstock,
suddenly lowered in the
midst of its poetry, even to nursery
familiarity, by the introduction of
such a phrase as “catch me who
can.”</p>

<p>But for one single effort of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
highest poetic flight we look in
vain.</p>

<p>Even the few snatches of his lyre
which he introduces fail to woo us.
They are not natural. If they are
poetry, it is poetry in a court-dress.
It is rich with brocade, and the
jewels glitter bravely; it treads
delicately, but its movements are artificial
and constrained. Compare,
for example, the song of the Woodstock
milkmaid, wherein labor is
visible in every line, with those
gushes of nature with which the
poet’s soul would seem to be bubbling
over the brim of the visible in
the various lyrical snatches of Ariel
or with the song of Spring at the
end of <cite>Love’s Labor Lost</cite>.</p>

<p>But what has more surprised us
than the lack of the poetic inspiration
in this drama is the occasional
want of correct taste in a writer of
such exceeding polish as Mr. Tennyson.
Such a speech as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“And God hath blest or cursed me with a nose&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Your boots are from the horses,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">should not have been put in the
mouth of a lady, still less a lady of
the rank of Elizabeth, and that the
less when she appeals to our sympathies
from a kind of honorable
imprisonment.</p>

<p>Lady Magdalen Dacres may have
beat King Philip with a staff for insulting
her, and have remained a
lady, but we do not want to be
told, in the midst of dramatic pathos,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“But by God’s providence a good stout staff</div>
<div class="verse">Lay near me; and you know me strong of arm;</div>
<div class="verse">I do believe I lamed his Majesty’s.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Is our poet, again, so barren of
invention that he could find no
other way of portraying Philip’s indifference
to his Queen than the
following:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent6">“By S. James, I do protest,</div>
<div class="verse">Upon the faith and honor of a Spaniard,</div>
<div class="verse">I am vastly grieved to leave your Majesty.</div>
<div class="verse">Simon, is supper ready?”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">“<span class="smcap">Renard</span>&mdash;Ay, my liege,</div>
<div class="verse">I saw the covers laying.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">“<span class="smcap">Philip</span>&mdash;Let’s have it.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Whatever may be the character
he may have wished to depict in
Philip, we expect a Spanish king
to be a gentleman. And such an
ending of a scene susceptible of the
tenderest pathos, where the heroine
and another of the principal personages
of the drama are in presence,
argues a wonderful dulness
of perception of the beautiful.</p>

<p>Worse than all, however, is his
treatment of Cardinal Pole.</p>

<p>Shakspere puts a few words of
Latin into the mouth of Cardinal
Wolsey in a scene in <cite>Henry VIII.</cite>,
in which he and Cardinal Campeggio
are endeavoring to bend the
queen to the king’s will. But it is
a wonderful touch of nature. It is
one of those profound intuitions for
which the great dramatist is so distinguished.
So seemingly simple
an incident reveals, at a touch, as
it were, the preoccupation of
Wolsey’s mind, and the hollowness
at once and difficulty of the duty
he had suffered to be imposed upon
him. They had paid her ostensibly
a private visit, as friends. But
Wolsey, oppressed with the difficulty
of his undertaking, and meditating
how he should set about it,
forgets himself, the old habit crops
up, and he begins as if he were beginning
a formal ecclesiastical document:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Tanta est erga te mentis integritas, regina serenissima.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is a slip. The queen stops him.
He recollects himself, and we hear
no more Latin.</p>

<p>But in this drama the poet literally
makes a cardinal, and such a
cardinal as Pole, address Queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Mary with the angelic salutation to
the Blessed Virgin, and in Latin:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Ave Maria, gratia plena, benedicta tu in mulieribus!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Upon the whole, the defects of
this drama are so many and so serious,
so radical and fundamental,
that no competent criticism can
pronounce it other than a failure;
and a failure more complete than
would have been thought possible
to a poet of so great a reputation as
Mr. Tennyson.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<h3>ARE YOU MY WIFE?</h3>

<p class="center">BY THE AUTHOR OF “PARIS BEFORE THE WAR,” “NUMBER THIRTEEN,”
“PIUS VI.,” ETC.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER IX.</h4>

<p>And now a new life began for
Franceline.</p>

<p>“You must fly from idleness as
from sin,” Father Henwick said;
“you must never let a regret settle
on your mind for an instant.
It will often be hard work to resist
them; but we are here to fight.
You must shut the door in the face
of idle thoughts by activity and
usefulness. I will help you in this.
You must set to work amongst the
poor; not so as to fatigue yourself,
or interfere with your duties and
occupations at home, but enough
to keep you busy and interested.
At first it will be irksome enough, I
dare say; but never mind that. By
and by the effort will bring its own
reward, and be a pleasure as well as
a duty.”</p>

<p>He sat down and wrote out a
time-table for her which filled up
every hour of the day, and left not
one moment for brooding. There
were visits to the cottages and a
class for children in the morning;
the afternoon hours were to be devoted
to helping her father, writing
and copying for him, sometimes
copying MSS. for Father Henwick,
with no other purpose than to keep
her mind and her fingers occupied.</p>

<p>But when the excitement caused
by this change in her daily routine
subsided, something of the first
heart-sinking returned. Do what
she would, thought would not be
dumb. The external activity could
not silence the busy tongues of her
brain or deafen her to their ceaseless
whisperings. It was weary
work staggering on under her load,
while memory tugged at her heart-strings
and dragged its longings
the other way. It was hard not to
yield to the temptation now and
then of sitting down by the wayside
to rest and look back towards
the Egypt that was for ever out of
sight. But Franceline very seldom
yielded to the treacherous allurement.
When she caught herself
lapsing into dreams, she would rise
up with a resolute effort, and shake
off the torpor, and set to work at
something. When the torpor
changed to a sting of anguish, she
would steep her soul in prayer&mdash;that
unfailing opiate of the suffering
spirit, its chloroform in pain.</p>

<p>One day, about three weeks after
Father Henwick’s return, she was
coming home through the wood
after her morning’s round amongst
the cottages. She was very tired
in mind and body. It was dull
work dinning the multiplication-table
into Bessy Bing’s thick skull,
and teaching her unnimble fingers
to turn the heel of a stocking; to
listen to the widow’s endless lamentations
over “the dear departed”
and the good old times when they
killed a pig every year, and always
had a bit of bacon on the rack.
Franceline came to the old spot
where she used to sit and listen to
the concert of the grove. The songsters
were nearly all silent now, for
the green was turning gold; but
the felled tree was lying in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
same place, and tempted her to rest
a moment and watch the sun shooting
his golden shafts through the wilderness
of stems all round. Another
moment, and she was in dreamland;
but the spell had scarcely fallen
on her when it was broken by
the sound of footfalls crushing the
yellow leaves that made a carpet
on every path. She started to her
feet, and walked on. A few steps
brought her face to face with Father
Henwick. He greeted her
with a joyous exclamation.</p>

<p>“Here comes my little missionary!
What has she been doing
to-day?”</p>

<p>“She has achieved a great conquest;
she has arrived at making
Bessy Bing apprehend the problem
that seven times nine and nine
times seven produce one and the
same total,” replied Franceline with
mock gravity.</p>

<p>Father Henwick laughed; but
the tired expression of her face did
not escape him.</p>

<p>“I am afraid you will be growing
too conceited if this sort of thing
goes on,” he said. “But you must
not overdo it, my dear child; it
won’t do to wear yourself out in
gaining arithmetical triumphs.”</p>

<p>“Better wear out than rust out.”
And Franceline shrugged her shoulders;
she had learned the expressive
French trick from her father.</p>

<p>The priest bent his clear eyes on
her for a second without speaking.
She read, disappointment, and perhaps
mild reproach, in them.</p>

<p>“I am sorry I said that, father;
I did not mean to complain.”</p>

<p>“Why are you sorry?”</p>

<p>“Because it was cowardly and
ungrateful.”</p>

<p>“To whom?”</p>

<p>“To you, who are so kind and
so patient with me!”</p>

<p>“And who bids me be kind?
Who teaches me to be patient with
you?&mdash;poor little bruised lamb!”</p>

<p>“I know it, father; I feel it in
the bottom of my heart; but one
can’t always be remembering.”
There was the slightest touch of
impatience in her tone.</p>

<p>“How if God were some day to
grow tired of remembering us, and
bearing with us, and forgiving us?”</p>

<p>“I know. But I am not rebelling;
only sickening and suffering.
You have told me there was no sin
in that?” The words came tremulous,
as if through rising tears; but
Franceline raised her head with a
defiant movement, and forced the
briny drops down. “I cannot help
it!” she continued impetuously;
“I have tried my best, and I cannot
help it!”</p>

<p>Father Henwick heaved an almost
inaudible sigh before he
said: “What cannot you help,
Franceline? Suffering?”</p>

<p>“No! I don’t care about that!
Remembering I cannot forget.”</p>

<p>“My poor child! would to God
I could help you! I would suffer
willingly in your place!” The
words came like a gush from his
inmost heart. They broke down
the sufferer’s proud resistance and
let the tears have vent. He turned
to walk back with her. For some
time neither spoke; only the soft
sobs that came unchecked from
Franceline broke the temple-like
stillness of the wood. Suddenly
she cried out in a tone of passionate
desperation: “O father! it is
dreadful. It will kill me if it lasts
much longer! The humiliation is
more than I can bear! To feel
that I am harboring a feeling that
my whole soul rebels against, that
is revolting in the eyes of God and
of my conscience! And I cannot
master it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“You will never master it by
pride, Franceline; that very pride
is your greatest hindrance in setting
your heart free. Try and think
more of God and less of yourself.
There is no sin, as you say, in the
suffering, any more than, if you
strayed to the edge of a precipice
in the dark, and fell over and were
killed, you would be guilty of suicide.
The sinfulness now is in
your rebellion against the suffering
simply because it wounds your
pride.”</p>

<p>“It is not all pride, father,” she
said meekly. Presently she turned
and looked up at him through wet
lashes. “Father, I must tell you
something,” she said, speaking with
a sort of timidity that was unusual
with her towards him&mdash;“a thought
that came to me this morning that
never came to me before.…”</p>

<p>“What was it?”</p>

<p>“If his wife should die … he
would be free?”</p>

<p>A dark shadow fell now on Father
Henwick’s large, smooth brow.
Franceline read his answer in the
frown and the averted gaze; but he
spoke soon, though he did not look
at her.</p>

<p>“That was a sinful thought! You
should have cast it behind you with
contempt. Has it come to that with
you, that you could look forward to
the death of any one as a thing to
be longed for?”</p>

<p>“I did not long for it. The
thought came to me.”</p>

<p>“You should have hunted it out
of your mind like an evil spirit, as
it was. You must never let it near
you again. <em>He</em> should be to you as
if he were already dead. Whether
his wife dies or not should not, and
does not, concern you. Besides,
how do you know whether she is not
as young as yourself, and stronger?
My child, such a thought as that
would lead you to the brink of an
abyss, if you listened to it.”</p>

<p>“I never will again, father,” she
answered promptly. “I hardly
know now whether I listened to it
or not; only I could not help telling
you.”</p>

<p>“You were right to tell me; and
now banish it, and never let it approach
you again.”</p>

<p>After a pause he resumed:</p>

<p>“You are sure that silence is
best with M. de la Bourbonais?”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes. How can you ask me,
father?” And Franceline looked up
in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yet it cannot remain a secret
from him for ever; he is almost
certain to hear of it sooner or later,
and it might save him a severe shock
if he heard it from you. It would
set his mind at rest about you?”</p>

<p>“It is quite at rest at present on
that score. He has no idea that
the discovery would be likely to
affect me.”</p>

<p>“You are better able to judge
of that, of course, than I am. But it
grieves me to see you have a secret
from your father; I wish it could
be avoided.”</p>

<p>“But it cannot; indeed it cannot!”
she repeated emphatically.
“You may trust me to speak, if I
thought it could be done without
injury to both of us. It is much
better to wait; perhaps by the time
it comes to his ears I may be able
to hear him speak of it without betraying
myself and paining him.”</p>

<p>Father Henwick acquiesced, but
reluctantly. He hoped she was
right in supposing M. de la Bourbonais
quite blind to what had
been so palpable to a casual observer.
But, making even the fullest
allowance for the absent-minded
habits of the studious man, this
seemed scarcely probable. Franceline
had affirmed it herself more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
confidently, perhaps, than was warranted.
She had, however, succeeded
in lulling her father into forgetfulness
of his former conjectures
and impressions; she was certain
of this. It had been done at a terrible
price of endurance and self-control;
but she had succeeded,
and it would be doubly cruel now
to revive his suspicions and let him
know the truth.</p>

<p>“I will trust you,” said Father
Henwick; “it is indeed a mercy
that he is not called upon to bear
such a trial while he is yet so unprepared.”</p>

<p>There was an earnestness about
him as he said this that would have
caused Franceline a deeper emotion
than curiosity if her mind
were not fixed wide of the mark.
She replied after a moment’s reflection:
“If anything should occur
to make it necessary to tell him,
will you break it to him, father?”</p>

<p>“I will,” said the priest simply.</p>

<p>Franceline had not the least fear
of Father Henwick. The severity
of his passionless brow did not
frighten her; it never checked the
outflow of the thoughts and emotions
that came surging up from
her own perturbed heart. He seemed
too far removed from strife himself
to be affected by it, except as
a pitying angel might, looking down
from his calm heaven on poor mortals
struggling and striving in the
smoke and din of their earthly battle-field.</p>

<p>“Father,” said Franceline suddenly,
“I wish I cared more for
the poor! I wish I could love
them and pity them as you do; but
I don’t. I’m so shy of going
amongst them. I’m sure I don’t
do them any good, and they don’t
do me any good, they’re so prosy
and egotistical&mdash;most of them, at
least.”</p>

<p>He turned an amused, indulgent
smile on her.</p>

<p>“There was a time when I
thought so too; but persevere, and
the love will come after a little
while. All that is worth having is
bought with sacrifice. Oh! if we
could only understand the blessedness
of sacrifice! Then we should
find the peace passing all understanding
that comes of passion
overcome, of sorrow generously accepted!”</p>

<p>He held out his hand to say good-by.
Franceline laid hers in it; but
did not remove it at once. “Father,”
she said, with her eyes lifted
in childlike fearlessness to his,
“one would think, to hear you
speak of passion overcome and sorrow
accepted, that you knew something
about them! I sometimes
wish you did. It would make it
easier to me to believe in the possibility
of overcoming and accepting.”</p>

<p>A change came over Father Henwick’s
face for one moment; it was
not a cloud nor a tremor, but the
shadow of some deep emotion that
must pass away before he could answer.
Then the words came with
grave simplicity, and low, as if they
were a prayer:</p>

<p>“Believe, then, my child, and
take courage; I have gone through
it all!”</p>

<p>He turned and walked back into
the wood. Franceline stood looking
after him through gathering
tear-drops. Never had he seemed
so far above her, so removed from
human weakness, as at this moment,
when he so humbly acknowledged
kindred with it.</p>

<p class="break">A pleasant surprise met Franceline
on her return home. Sir Simon
was at The Lilies, and loudly
expressing his indignation at not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
finding her there to greet him. She
arrived, however, before he had
quite divested himself of a cargo
of small boxes which he had carried
down himself in order to have
the delight of witnessing her curiosity
and pleasure in their contents.
There was hardly any event which
could have given her so much pleasure
in her present frame of mind as
the sight of her kind old friend;
and she satisfied him to the full by
her affectionate welcome and her
delight in all his presents. He had
not forgotten her favorite <i lang="fr">friandise</i>&mdash;chocolate
bonbons&mdash;and she set to
nibbling them at once, in spite of
Angélique’s protest against such a
proceeding close on dinner-time.</p>

<p>“Va, petite gourmande!” exclaimed
the <i lang="fr">bonne</i>, tramping off to
her kitchen, in high glee to see
Franceline’s gayety and innocent
greediness over the dainty.</p>

<p>Sir Simon was, if possible, in
brighter spirits than ever; like Job’s
friends, he was “full of discourse,”
so that there was nothing to do but
listen and laugh as the current
rippled on. He had a deal to tell
about his rambles in the Pyrenees,
and a whole budget of adventures
to retail, and anecdotes about odd
people he had come across in all
sorts of out-of-the-way places. Nothing
checked the pleasant flow
until M. de la Bourbonais had the
unlucky inspiration to inquire for
Lady Rebecca’s health; whereupon
the baronet raised his right hand
and let it fall again with an emphatic
gesture, shook his head, and
compressed his lips in ominous silence.
Raymond, who held the key
of the pantomime, gathered therefrom
that Lady Rebecca had for
the six-and-thirtieth time rallied
from the jaws of death, and plunged
her long-suffering heir once
more into dejection and disappointment.
He knew what was in store
for his private ear, and heaved a
sigh. “But the present hour shall
be a respite,” Sir Simon seemed to
say; and he quitted the subject
abruptly, and proceeded to catechise
Franceline on her behavior
since his departure. He was surprised
and annoyed to find that she
had been to no parties; that nothing
more exciting than that short visit
to Rydal had come of his deep-laid
scheme with the dowager; and that
there had been no rivalry of gallant
suitors attacking the citadel of The
Lilies. He had been rather nervous
before meeting her; for, though
it had been made quite clear to
him by Raymond’s letters that <em>he</em>
had received no crushing blow of
any description, Sir Simon had a
lurking fear that recent events
might have left a deeper shadow
on his daughter’s existence than he
was conscious of. Her aspect, however,
set him at ease on this score.
He could hardly have lighted on a
more favorable moment for the
confirmation of his sanguine hopes
regarding Franceline’s heart-wholeness.
True, she had been crying,
only half an hour ago, bitter, burning
tears enough; but her face retained
no trace of them, and it still
held the glow of inward triumph
that Father Henwick’s last words
had called up into her eyes, and
her cheeks had got a faint color
from the rapid walking. Sir Simon
breathed freely as he took note of
these outward signs; he could indulge
in a little chaffing without remorse
or <i lang="fr">arrière-pensée</i>. He wanted
to know, merely as a matter of
curiosity, how many hearts she had
broken in his absence&mdash;how many
unfortunates had been mortally
struck as they passed within reach
of her arrows on the wayside. Franceline
protested that she carried no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
quiver, and had not inflicted a
scratch on any one. Humph! Sir
Simon invited her to convey that
answer to the marines.</p>

<p>“And how about Ponsonby
Anwyll? Has he been here lately?”</p>

<p>“No; he called twice, but papa
and I were out.”</p>

<p>“Poor devil! so much the better
for him! But he won’t have
the sense to keep out of harm’s
way; he’ll be at it again before
long.”</p>

<p>Franceline gave one of her merry
laughs&mdash;she was in a mood to enjoy
the absurdity of the joke&mdash;and went
to take off her things; for Angélique
put in her head to say that dinner
was ready.</p>

<p>Things fell quickly into their old
course at the Court. There was a
procession of morning callers every
day, and pleasant friendly dinners,
and a few men down in relays to
shoot. Sir Simon insisted on M.
de la Bourbonais coming to join
them frequently, and bringing Franceline;
he had established a precedent,
and he was not going to let it
drop. Franceline, on the whole,
was glad of the excitement; she
was determined to use everything
that could help her good resolutions;
and the necessity for seeming
to enjoy soon led to her doing so
in reality. After the stillness of her
little home-life, filled as it was with
restless voices audible to no ear but
hers, the gay stir of the Court was
welcome. It was a pleasurable
sensation, too, to feel herself the object
of admiring attentions from a
number of agreeable gentlemen, to
be deferred to and made much of,
as if she were a little queen amongst
them all. Sir Simon was more indulgent
than ever, and spoiled her
to his heart’s content. Father Henwick,
who was kept <i lang="fr">au courant</i> of
what was going on, could not find
it in his heart to oppose what seemed
to be an innocent diversion of
her thoughts.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, anything but a
welcome break when Lady Anwyll
came down one morning, accompanied
by Sir Simon, to announce
her intention of carrying off her
friend the next day to Rydal.
Franceline fought off while she
could, but Sir Simon pooh-poohed
her excuses about not liking to
leave her father, and so forth; <em>he</em>
was there now to look after him,
and she must go. So she went.
Rydal had a dreadful association
in her mind, and she shrank from going
there as from revisiting the
scene of some horrible tragedy.
She shrank, too, from leaving her
father. Of late they had been more
bound up in their daily life than
ever; she had coaxed him into accepting
her services as an amanuensis,
and he had quickly grown so
used to them that he was sure to
miss her greatly at his work.</p>

<p>There was nothing, moreover, in
the inmates of Rydal to compensate
her for the sacrifice; they were not
the least interesting. It was always
the same good-natured petting from
Lady Anwyll, as if she were a kitten
or a baby. She knew exactly
what the conversation would be&mdash;gossip
about local trifles, about
the family, especially Ponce, his
boots, his eccentricities, his pet
dishes, his pranks in the regiment;
the old tune played over and over
again on the same string. As to
Ponce himself, Franceline knew the
big hussar already by heart; he
would do his best to be entertaining,
and would only be awkward
and commonplace. Nothing at
Rydal, in fact, rose above the dead-level
of Dullerton.</p>

<p>The dowager had some few young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
people in for a carpet-dance, in
which Franceline had to take her
part, and did without any repugnance.
Dancing brought back certain
memories that pierced her like
steel blades; but her heart was
proof against the thrusts, and she
defied them to wound her. Lord
Roxham was invited, and showed
himself cordial and friendly, but
nothing more. He said he had
been called away to London soon
after they last met, or else he would
have profited by M. de la Bourbonais’
permission to call at The
Lilies; he hoped that the authorization
might still hold good.</p>

<p>“Oh! yes; do come. I shall be
so glad to see you,” was the frank
and unaffected reply.</p>

<p>Lady Anwyll had meantime felt
rather aggrieved at Lord Roxham’s
behavior. Her little scheme had
gone off so swimmingly at first she
could not understand why it had
suddenly collapsed in its prosperous
course, and come to a dead
halt. At any rate, she would give
him one more chance. The young
legislator seemed in no violent hurry
to improve it. He danced a
couple of times with Franceline,
and once with two other young
girls, and then subsided to dummy
whist with the rector of Rydal and
his wife, leaving Franceline to the
combined fascinations of Mr. Charlton
and Ponce, who usurped her
between them. The latter bestowed
such an unequal share of a
host’s courtesy on the young French
girl, indeed, that his mother felt it
incumbent on her to explain to the
other young ladies that Mlle. de la
Bourbonais was a foreigner; therefore
Ponce, being so good-natured,
paid her particular attention. And
he certainly did&mdash;not only on that
occasion, but while she remained.
He was continually hovering about
her like a huge overshadowing
bird whose wings were always in
the way of its movements. He tripped
over footstools in attempting
to place them under her feet; but
then he was always so thankful that
it was himself, not her, he nearly
upset! He spilt several cups of
tea in handing them to her, and
was nearly overcome with gratitude
when he saw the carpet had got the
contents, and that her pretty muslin
frock was safe! He <em>would</em> hold an
umbrella open over her because it
looked so uncommonly like rain;
and it was such a mercy to have
only spoiled her bonnet and made
a hole in her veil, when he might
so easily have run the point into
her eye. Ponce, like many wiser
men, had endless satisfaction in the
contemplation of the blunders he
might have committed and did not.
Yet, with all his boyish awkwardness,
Franceline was growing very
fond of him. He was so thoroughly
kind-hearted, and so free from
the taint of conceit; and then
there was an undeniable enjoyment
in the sense of being cared for,
and thought of, and watched over;
and it was all done in a naïve, boyish
way, and with a brotherly absence
of compliment or constraint
that left her free to accept it without
any sense of undue obligation,
or the fear of being called upon to
repay it except by being pleased
and grateful. When he followed
her into the conservatory with a
shawl and wrapped it round her
unceremoniously, she looked up at
his fresh, honest face, and said, almost
as if he had been a woman:
“I wish I had you for a brother,
Captain Anwyll!” He got very
red, and was fumbling somewhere
in his mind for an answer, when
his mother called to him for the
watering-pot; Ponce seized it, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
dashing out a sudden shower-bath
upon the dowager’s dress, narrowly
escaped drenching Franceline’s.
But it did escape. What a lucky
dog he was!</p>

<p>How pleasant it was riding home
in the fresh afternoon! Lady Anwyll
came in the carriage, while
Franceline and Capt. Anwyll cantered
on before. Nothing was likely
to have happened at The Lilies
during her absence; but as they
drew near she grew impatient and
rode at a pace, as if she expected
wonderful tidings at the ride’s end.
The air was so clear that Dullerton,
yet a mile off, sent its hum of
life towards the riders with sharp
distinctness. The panting of the
train, as it moved out of the station,
sounded close by; every street cry
and tinkling cart-bell rang out like
a chime. Soon the soft cooing of
the doves came wafted above the
distant voice of the town; and when
the travellers came within sight of
The Lilies, the flock flew to greet
Franceline, wheeling round high
up in the air several times before
alighting on her shoulders and outstretched
wrist. Then came her
father’s delighted exclamation, as
he hurried down the little garden-walk,
and Angélique’s affectionate
embrace. And once more the
small, still home-life, that was so
sweet and so rich in a restored joy,
recommenced. Franceline devoted
hours every day now to working
with her father, and soon she became
almost as much absorbed in
the work as he was. Sometimes,
indeed, she hindered rather than
helped, stopping him in the midst
of his dictation to demand an explanation;
but Raymond never
chided her or grudged the delay.
Her fresh young eyesight and diligent,
nimble hand were invaluable
to him, and he wondered
how he had got on so long without
them.</p>

<p class="break">Lord Roxham redeemed his
promise of calling at The Lilies.
He talked a good deal to Raymond
about politics and current events,
saying very little to Franceline, who
sat by, stitching away at some bit
of plain sewing. This was just
what she liked. Her father was entertained
and interested. A breeze
from the outer world always refreshed
him, though he was hardly
conscious of it, still less of needing
any such reviving incident in
his quiet, monotonous existence;
but Franceline always hailed it with
thankfulness for him, and was well
content to remain in the shade now
while the visitor devoted himself to
amusing her father. Was it fancy,
or did she, on glancing up suddenly
from her needle-work, detect an expression,
half compassionate, half
searching, in Lord Roxham’s face,
as he looked fixedly at her? Whether
it was fancy or not, her eyes fell
at once, and the blood mantled her
cheek; she did not venture to let
her gaze light on him again, and it
was with a sense of shyness that she
shook hands with him at parting.</p>

<p>Ponsonby Anwyll was now a frequent
visitor at The Lilies, sometimes
coming alone, sometimes with
Sir Simon; and it was a curious
coincidence, if quite accidental,
that he generally made his appearance
as Franceline was on the point
of starting for her ride; and as he
was always on horseback, there was
no conceivable reason why he should
not join the party. The burly hussar
was a safer companion in the
saddle than in the drawing-room;
he rode with the masterly ease of
a cavalryman, and, the road being
free from the disturbing influence
of tea-trays and chairs, he spilt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
nothing and upset nobody, and
Franceline was always glad of his
company. She was too inexperienced
and too much absorbed in
other thoughts to forecast any possible
results from this state of
things. Ponsonby continued the
same familiar, kind, brother-like
manner to her; was mightily concerned
in keeping her out of the
bad bits of road, and out of the
way of the cattle that might be
tramping to market and prove offensive
to her mettlesome pony.
He never aimed at making himself
agreeable, only useful. But the
eyes of Dullerton looked on at all
this brotherly attention, and drew
its own conclusion. The Langrove
young ladies, of whom somehow
she had of late seen less than ever,
grew excited to the highest pitch
about it, and were already discussing
how many of them would be
bridemaids at the wedding, if
bridemaids there were. Most likely
Sir Simon would settle that
and probably give the dresses.
Even discreet Miss Merrywig could
not forbear shaking her finger and
her barrel curls at Franceline one
day when the latter hurried off to
get ready for her ride, with the excuse
that Sir Simon and Capt.
Anwyll were due at three o’clock.
But Franceline knew by this time
what Dullerton was, and what it
could achieve in the way of gossip;
spinning a yarn a mile long
out of a thread the length of your
finger. She only laughed, and mentally
remarked how little people
knew. They would be marrying
her to Sir Simon next, when Ponsonby
rejoined his regiment and
was seen no more at her saddle-bow.</p>

<p>The three had set out for a ride
one afternoon, when, as they were
dashing along at full tilt, Sir Simon
pulled up with a strong formula of
exclamation.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” cried Sir
Ponsonby, plunging back heavily,
while Franceline reined in Rosebud,
and turned in some alarm to see
what had occurred.</p>

<p>“If I have not actually forgotten
all about Simpson, who comes down
from London by appointment this
afternoon! I dare say he’s waiting
for me by this, and he must return
by the 5:20. I must leave you,
and post home as quick as Nero
will carry me.” And with a “by-by”
to Franceline and a nod to
Capt. Anwyll, coupled with an injunction
not to let her ride too
fast and to keep her out of mischief,
the baronet turned his horse’s
head and galloped away, desiring
the groom to follow on with the
others.</p>

<p>They went on at a good pace
until they reached the foot of a
gentle ascent, when both of one accord
fell into a walk. For the first
time in their intercourse Franceline
was conscious of a certain vague
awkwardness with Capt. Anwyll;
of casting about for something to
say, and not finding anything. The
place was perfectly solitary, the
woods on one side, the fields sloping
down to the river on the other.
The groom lagged respectfully a
long way behind, quite out of ear-shot,
often out of sight; for the road
curved and wheeled abruptly every
now and then, and hid the foremost
riders from his view. Ponsonby
broke the silence:</p>

<p>“Miss Franceline”&mdash;he would
call her Miss Franceline, because it
was easier and shorter&mdash;“I have
something on my mind that I want
badly to say to you. I’ve been
wanting to say it for some time. I
hope it won’t make you angry?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say till I hear it; but if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
you are in doubt about it, perhaps
it would be safer not to say it,” remarked
Franceline, beginning to
tremble ominously.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t vex you for anything
in the world! ’Pon my honor I
wouldn’t!” protested Ponce warmly.
“But, you see, I don’t know
whether what I’m going to say will
vex you or not.”</p>

<p>“Then don’t say it; you are
sure not to vex me then,” was the
encouraging advice, and she devoutly
hoped he would take it.
But he was not so minded.</p>

<p>“That’s true,” he assented; “but
then, you see, it might please you.
I’m half afraid it won’t, though,
only I can’t be sure till I try.”
After musing a moment, in obvious
perplexity, he resumed, speaking
rapidly, as if he had made up his
mind to bolt it all out and take the
consequences. “I’m not a puppy&mdash;my
worst enemy won’t accuse me
of that; but I’m not a bad fellow
either, as my mother and all the
fellows in the Tenth will tell you;
and the fact is, I’ve grown very fond
of you, Miss Franceline, and if
you’ll take me as I am I’ll do my
best to be a good husband to you
and to make you happy.”</p>

<p>He said it quickly, as if he were
reciting a lesson got by heart, and
then came to a dead halt and
“paused for a reply.” He might
have paused long enough, if he had
not at last turned round and read
his fate in Franceline’s scared,
white face and undisguised agitation.</p>

<p>“Oh! now, don’t say no before
you think it over!” entreated the
young man. “I know you’re ten
times too good for me; but, for
that matter, you’re too good for the
best fellow that ever lived. I said
so myself to Sir Simon only this
morning. But I do love you with
all my heart, Franceline; and if
only you could care for me ever so
little to begin with, I’d be satisfied,
and you’d make me the happiest
man alive!”</p>

<p>Franceline had now recovered
her self-possession, and was able to
speak, though she still trembled.</p>

<p>“I am so sorry!” she exclaimed.
“I never dreamed of this; indeed
I did not! I dare say I have been
very selfish, very thoughtless; but
it was not wilful. I am very unhappy
to have given you pain!”</p>

<p>“Oh! don’t say that. You’ll make
me miserable if you say that!” pleaded
Ponsonby. “Of course you never
thought of it. It’s great impudence
of me to think of it, I have so little
to offer you! But if you don’t
quite hate the sight of me, I’m sure
I could make you a devoted husband,
and love you better than
many a cleverer fellow. I’ve been
fond of you from the first, and so
has my mother.”</p>

<p>“You are both very good to me;
I am very, very grateful!” The
tears rose to her eyes, and with a
frank, impulsive movement she
held out her hand to him. Ponsonby
bent from the saddle and
raised it to his lips, although it
was gloved. If he had not been
over-sanguine at heart and a trifle
stupid, poor fellow, he would have
felt that it was all over with him.
The little hand lay with cold, sisterly
kindness in his grasp, and
Franceline looked at him with eyes
that were too kind and pitying to
promise anything more than sisterly
pity and gratitude.</p>

<p>“I cannot, I cannot. You must
never think of it any more. Do
you not see that it is impossible?
I am a Catholic!”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! as if that mattered a
whit! I mean as if it need make
any difference between us! I don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
mind it a pin&mdash;’pon my honor I
don’t! I said so to the count.
We’ve settled all that, in fact, and
if he’s satisfied to trust me why
will not you?”</p>

<p>“Then you have spoken to my
father?”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes; that was the right
thing, Sir Simon told me, as he was
a Frenchman.”</p>

<p>“And what did he say to you?”</p>

<p>“He said that if you said yes, he
was quite willing to give you to me.
I wanted to come to settlements at
once&mdash;I only wish I was ten times
better off!&mdash;but he would not hear
a word about that until I had consulted
you. Only, he said he would
be glad to receive me as his son;
he did indeed, Franceline!” She
was looking straight before her,
her eyes dilated, her whole face
aglow with some strong emotion
that his words seemed to have stirred
in her.</p>

<p>“You remember,” continued
Ponsonby, “that you said to me
once you would like to have me for
a brother? Well, it will be nearly
the same thing. You would get
used to me as a husband after a
while; you would, Franceline!”</p>

<p>“Never, never, never!” she repeated,
not passionately, but with a
calm emphasis that made Ponsonby’s
heart die within him. He
could not find a word to oppose
to the strong, quiet protest.</p>

<p>“No, it is all a mistake,” said
Franceline. “I don’t know who is
to blame&mdash;I suppose I am. I should
not have let you come so often;
but you were so kind, and I have
so few people to care for me; and
when one is sad at heart, kindness is
so welcome! But I should have
thought of you; I have been selfish!”</p>

<p>“No, no, you have not been selfish
at all; it’s all my doing and
my fault,” affirmed the young
man. “I wish I had held my
tongue a little longer. My mother
will come and see you to-morrow;
she will explain it all, and how it
sha’n’t make any trouble to you, my
being a Protestant.”</p>

<p>“She must not come,” said Franceline
with decision; “there is nothing
to explain. I am sincerely
grateful to her and to you; but I
have only gratitude to give you. I
hope with all my heart that you
may soon forget me and any pain
I am causing you, and that you
may meet with a wife who will
make you happier than I could have
done.”</p>

<p>Ponsonby was silent for a few moments,
and then he said, speaking
with a certain hesitation and diffidence:</p>

<p>“I could be satisfied to wait and
to go on hoping, if I were sure of
one thing:… that you did not
care for anybody else. Do you?”</p>

<p>She flashed a glance of indignant
pride at him.</p>

<p>“What right have you to put
such a question to me? I tell you
I do not care for you, and that I
will never marry you! You have
no right to ask me any more.”</p>

<p>Ponsonby recoiled as if a flash
of lightning had forked out of the
cold, gray sky. “Good heavens! I
did not mean to offend you. I
declare solemnly I did not!”</p>

<p>But he had touched a vibrating
chord unawares, and set every fibre
in her heart thrilling and every
pulse throbbing; and the disturbance
was not to be laid by any
words that he could utter. Franceline
turned homewards, and they
did not exchange a word until they
reached The Lilies and Ponsonby
was assisting her to alight.</p>

<p>“Say you forgive me!” he said,
speaking very low and penitently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>She had already forgiven him
but not herself.</p>

<p>“I do, and I am sorry for being
so impetuous. Good-by!”</p>

<p>“And my mother may come and
see you to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“No, no! It is no use; it is no
use! I say again I wish you were
my brother, Sir Ponsonby, but, as
you care to remain my friend, never
speak to me again of this.”</p>

<p>He pressed the hand she held
out to him; the groom backed up
to take the reins of her horse, and
Ponsonby rode away with a thorn
in his honest heart.</p>

<p>Miss Merrywig was within, chatting
and laughing away with the
count. Franceline was not in a
mood to meet the garrulous old
lady or anybody; so she went
straight to her room, and only came
down when the visitor was gone.</p>

<p>“Father,” she said, going up behind
him and laying a hand on
each shoulder, “what is this Sir
Ponsonby tells me? That you are
tired of your <i lang="fr">clair-de-lune</i>, and
want to get rid of her?”</p>

<p>M. de la Bourbonais drew down
the two trembling hands, and clasped
them on his breast, and lifted
his head as if he would look at her.</p>

<p>“It would not be losing her, but
gaining a son, who would take care
of her when I am gone! She has
not thought of that!”</p>

<p>“No; and she does not wish to
think of it! I will live with you
while I live. I don’t care to look
beyond that; nor must you, petit
père. But I am very sorry for Sir
Ponsonby. You must write and
tell him so, and that he must not
come any more&mdash;until he has forgotten
me; that you cannot give
me up.”</p>

<p>“My cherished one! Let us
talk about this matter; it is very
serious. We must not do anything
rashly.” He tried to unclasp her
hands and draw her to his side;
but she locked them tighter, and
laid her cheek on his head.</p>

<p>“Petit père, there is nothing to
talk about; I will never marry him
or anybody!”</p>

<p>“My child, thou speakest without
reflection. Captain Anwyll is a
good, honorable man, and he loves
thee, and it would be a great comfort
to me to see thee married to
him, and not to leave thee friendless
and almost penniless whenever
God calls me away. I understand
it has taken thee by surprise, and
that thou canst not accept the idea
without some delay and getting
used to it; but we must not decide so
important a matter hastily. Come,
sit down, and let us discuss it.”</p>

<p>“No, father,” she answered in
a tone of determination that was
quite foreign to her now, and reminded
him of the wilful child of
long ago; “there is no use in discussing
what is already decided.
I will never marry Ponsonby&mdash;or
anybody. Why, petit père, do you
forget that he is a Protestant?”</p>

<p>“Nay, I have forgotten nothing;
that has been all arranged. He is
most liberal about it; consents to
leave you to … to have everything
your own way in that respect,
and assures me that it shall make
no difference whatever to you, his
not being of your religion.”</p>

<p>“No difference, father! No difference
to a wife that her husband
should be a heretic! You
cannot be in earnest. What blessing
could there be on such a marriage?”</p>

<p>“But you would soon convert
him, my little one; you would
make a good Catholic of him before
the year was out,” said M. de
la Bourbonais. “Think of that!”</p>

<p>“And suppose it were the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
way, and that he made a good Protestant
of me? It is no more than
I should deserve for my presumption.
You know what happens to
those who seek the danger.…”</p>

<p>“Oh! that is a different thing;
that warning applies to those who
seek it rashly, from vain or selfish
motives,” protested Raymond, moving
his spectacles, as he always did
instinctively when his argument
was weak; and he knew right well
that now it was slipping into sophistry.</p>

<p>“I cannot see anything but a
selfish motive in marrying against
the express prohibition of the
church and without any affection
for the person, but simply because
he could give you a position and
the good things of this life,” said
Franceline.</p>

<p>“The prohibition is conditional,”
persisted Raymond, “and those
conditions would be scrupulously
fulfilled; and as to there not being
the necessary affection, there is
enough on his side for both, and
his love would soon beget thine.”</p>

<p>“Father, it is no use. I am grieved
to contradict you; but I cannot,
cannot do this to please you. You
must write and say so to Capt.
Anwyll; you must indeed.”</p>

<p>Raymond heaved a sigh. He
felt as powerless as an infant before
this new wilfulness of his <i lang="fr">clair-de-lune</i>;
it was foolish as well as imprudent
to yield, but he did not
know how to deal with it. There
was honest truth on her side; no
subterfuges could baffle the instinctive
logic of her childlike faith.</p>

<p>“We will let things remain as
they are for a few days, and then,
if thou dost still insist, I will write
and refuse the offer,” he said, seeking
a last chance in temporizing.</p>

<p>“No, petit père; if you love me,
write at once. It is only fair to
Sir Ponsonby, and it will set my
mind at rest. Here, let me find
you a pen!” She chose one out
of a number of inky goose-quills on
the little Japan tray, and thrust it
playfully between his fingers.</p>

<p>The letter was written, and Angélique
was forthwith despatched
with it to the pillar at the park
gate.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the afternoon
Franceline worked away
diligently at the Causes of the
French Revolution, and spent the
evening reading aloud. But M. de
la Bourbonais could not so lightly
dismiss the day’s incident from his
thoughts. He had experienced a
moment of pure joy and unutterable
thankfulness when Ponsonby
had come in and stammered out
his honest confession of love, and
pleaded so humbly with the father
to “take his part with Miss Franceline.”
The pleasure was all the
greater for being a complete surprise.
Sir Simon had cautiously
resolved to have no hand in negotiating
between the parties; he had
let things take their course from
the first, determined not to interfere,
but clearly foreseeing the issue.
Raymond was bewildered by Franceline’s
rejection of the proposed
marriage. He did not try much
to explain it to himself; it was a
puzzle that did not come within the
rule and compass of his philosophy&mdash;a
young girl refusing to be married
when an eligible husband presented
himself for her father’s acceptance.
He heaved many a deep
sigh over it, as his anxious gaze
rested on the golden-haired young
head bent over the desk. But he
did not ask any questions.</p>

<p>Sir Simon came down next morning
in high displeasure. He was
angry, disappointed, aggrieved.
Here he had been at considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
pains of ingenuity and forethought
to provide a model husband for
Franceline, a young fellow whom
any girl ought to jump at&mdash;high-principled,
unencumbered rent-roll,
good-looking, good-tempered&mdash;and
the little minx turns up her nose at
him, and sends him to the right-about!
Such perverseness and folly
were not to be tolerated. What
did she mean by it? What did she
see amiss in Anwyll? Sir Simon
was for having her up for a round
lecture. But Raymond would not
allow this. He might groan in his
inmost heart over Franceline’s refusal,
but he was not going to let
her be bullied by anybody; not
even by Sir Simon. He stood up
for his child, and defended her as
if he had fully approved of her conduct.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what it is, Bourbonais,
you’re just as great a fool as
she is; only she is a child, and
knows nothing of life, and can’t see
the madness of what she is doing.
But you ought to know better. I
have no patience with you. When
one thinks of what this marriage
would do for both of you&mdash;lifting
you out of penury, restoring your
daughter to her proper position in
the world, and securing her future,
so that, if you were called away to-morrow,
you need have no care or
anxiety about her! And to think
of your backing her up in rejecting
it all!”</p>

<p>“I did not back her up in it. I
deplore her having done so,” replied
Raymond. “But I will not
coerce her; her happiness is dearer
to me than her interest or my
own.”</p>

<p>“What tomfoolery! As if her
interest and her happiness were not
identical in this case! A man who
is fond of her, and rich enough to
give her everything in life a girl
could wish for! What does she
want besides?” demanded Sir Simon
angrily.</p>

<p>“I believe she wants nothing, except
to be left with her old father.
She does not care for Capt. Anwyll,”
said Raymond; but his French
mind felt this was very weak argument.</p>

<p>“The devil she doesn’t! Who
does she care for?” retorted the
baronet. But he had no sooner
uttered the words than he regretted
them; they seemed to recoil on
him like a stone flung too near. He
seized his hat, and, muttering impatiently
something about the nonsense
of giving into childish fancies,
etc., strode out of the cottage,
and did not show himself there for
several days.</p>

<p>He was pursued by that question
of his own, “Who did Franceline
care for?” and made uncomfortable
by the persistency with which
it kept dinning in his ears. He had
made up his mind long ago that the
failure of his first matrimonial plot
had had no serious effect on her
heart or spirits. She was looking
very delicate when he came back,
but that was the dulness of the life
she had been leading during his absence.
She had picked up considerably
since then. It was plain to
everybody she had; her spirits were
better. There was certainly nothing
wrong in that direction. How
could there be when he, Sir Simon,
so thoroughly desired the contrary,
and did so much to cheer up the
child&mdash;and himself into the bargain&mdash;and
make her forget any impression
that unlucky Clide might have
made? Still, no matter how emphatically
he answered it, the tiresome
question kept sounding in his
ears day after day. He could stand
it no longer. He must go and see
them at The Lilies&mdash;see Franceline,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
and read on her innocent young
face that all was peace within, and
cheer up his own depressed spirits
by a talk with Raymond. Nobody
listened to him and sympathized
with him as Raymond did. He
had no worries of his own to distract
him, for one thing; and if he
had, he was such a philosophical
being he would carry them to the
moon and leave them there. Sir
Simon was blessed with no such
happy faculty. He could forget
his troubles for a while under the
stimulating balm of cheerful society
and generous wine; but as soon as
he was alone they were down on
him like an army of ants, stinging
and goading him. Things were
very gloomy just now, and he could
less than ever dispense with the
opiate of sympathetic companionship.
Lady Rebecca had taken a
fresh start, and was less likely to
depart than she had been for the
last ten years. The duns, who
watched her ladyship’s fluctuations
between life and death with almost
as sincere and breathless an interest
as her heir, had got wind of this,
and were up and at him again,
hunting him like a hare&mdash;the low,
grasping, insolent hounds! His
revived money annoyances made
him the more irascible with Franceline
for throwing away her chance
of being for ever saved and protected
from the like. But he would
harp no more on that string.</p>

<p>He had been into Dullerton on
horseback, and, overtaking the postman
on his way home, he stopped
to take his letters, and then asked
if there were any for The Lilies.
He was going there, and would save
the postman the walk that far.</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir! There is one
for the count.” And the man held
up a large blue envelope, like a
lawyer’s letter, which Sir Simon
thrust into his pocket. He left his
horse at the Court, and walked on
through the park, reading his letters
as he went. Their contents
were not of the most agreeable, to
judge by the peevish and angry
ejaculations that the reader emitted
in the course of their perusal. He
had not done when he reached the
cottage.</p>

<p>“Here’s a letter for you, Bourbonais;
I’ll finish mine while you’re
reading it.” He handed the blue
envelope to his friend, and, flinging
himself into a chair, became again
absorbed and ejaculatory.</p>

<p>M. de la Bourbonais, meanwhile,
proceeded to open his official-looking
communication. He surveyed
it with uplifted eyebrows, examined
well the large red seal, and scrutinized
the handwriting of the address,
before he tore it open. His
eye ran quickly over the page. A
nervous twitch contracted his features;
his hand shook as if a string
at his elbow had been rudely pulled;
but he controlled all further
sign of emotion, and, after reading
the contents twice over, silently
folded the letter and replaced it in
the envelope. Sir Simon had seen
nothing; he was deep in suppressed
denunciations of some rascally
dun.</p>

<p>“Hang me if I know what’s to
be the end of it, or the end of
me&mdash;an ounce of lead in my skull,
most likely!” he burst out, ramming
the bundle of offending documents
into his coat-pocket. “The
brutes are in league to drive me
mad!”</p>

<p>“Has anything new happened?”
inquired the count anxiously. “I
hoped things had arranged themselves
of late?”</p>

<p>“Not they! How can they when
these vampires are sucking the
blood of one? It’s pretty much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
like sucking a corpse!” he laughed
sardonically. “The fools! If they
would but have sense to see that it
is their own interest not to drive
me to desperation! But they will
goad me to do something that will
make an end of their chance of
ever being paid!”</p>

<p>M. de la Bourbonais ought to
have been hardened to this sort of
thing; but he was not. The vague
threats and dark innuendoes always
alarmed him. He never knew but
that each crisis which called them
out might be the supreme one that
would bring about their fulfilment.
At such moments he had not the
heart to rebuke Sir Simon and add
the bitterness of self-reproach to
his excited feelings. His look of
keen distress struck Sir Simon with
compunction.</p>

<p>“Oh! it will blow off, as it has
done so often before, I suppose,” he
said, tossing his head. “Here’s a
letter from L&mdash;&mdash; to say he is coming
down next week with a whole
houseful of men to shoot. I’ve not
seen L&mdash;&mdash; for an age. He’s a delightful
fellow; he’ll cheer one up.”
And the baronet heaved a sigh
from the very depths of his afflicted
spirit.</p>

<p>“Mon cher, is it wise to be asking
down crowds of people in this
way?” asked Raymond dubiously.</p>

<p>“I did not ask them! Don’t I
tell you they have written to invite
themselves?”</p>

<p>It was true; but Sir Simon forgot
how often he had besought his
friends to do just what they were
now doing&mdash;to write and say when
they could come, and to bring as
many as they liked with them.
That had always been the way at
the Court; and he was not the man
to belie its old traditions. But
Raymond, who had also his class of
noble traditions, could not see it.</p>

<p>“Why not write frankly, and,
without explaining the precise motive,
say that you cannot at present
receive any one?”</p>

<p>Sir Simon gave an impatient
pshaw!</p>

<p>“Nonsense, my dear Bourbonais,
nonsense! As if a few fellows
more or less signified that”&mdash;snapping
his fingers&mdash;“at the end of
the year! Besides, what the deuce
is the good of having a place at all,
if one can’t have one’s friends
about one in it? Better shut up at
once. It’s the only compensation
a man has; the only thing that
pulls him through. And then the
pheasants are there, and must be
shot. I can’t shoot them all. But
it’s no use trying to make you take
an Englishman’s view of the case.
You simply can’t do it.”</p>

<p>M. de la Bourbonais agreed, and
inwardly hoped he never might
come to see the case as his friend
did. But, notwithstanding this, Sir
Simon went on discussing his own
misfortunes, denouncing the rascality
and rapacity of the modern
tradesman, and bemoaning the good
old times when the world was a fit
place for a gentleman to live in.
When he had sufficiently relieved
his mind on the subject, and drew
breath, M. de la Bourbonais poured
what oil of comfort he could on his
friend’s wounds. He spoke confidently
of the ultimate demise of
Lady Rebecca, and expressed equal
trust in the powers of Mr. Simpson
to perform once again the meteorological
feat known to Sir Simon as
“raising the wind.” Under the influence
of these soothing abstractions
the baronet cheered up, and
before long Richard was himself
again. He overhauled Raymond’s
latest work; read aloud some notes
on Mirabeau which Franceline had
taken down at his dictation the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
previous evening, and worked himself
into a frenzy of indignation at
the historian’s partiality for that
thundering demagogue. Raymond
waxed warm in defence of his hero;
maintained that at heart Mirabeau
had wished to save the king; and
almost lost his philosophical self-control
when Sir Simon called him
the master-knave of the Revolution,
a traitor and a bully, and other hard
names to the same effect.</p>

<p>“I wash my hands of you, if you
are going to play panegyrist to that
pock-marked ruffian!” was the baronet’s
concluding remark; and he
flung out his hands, as if he were
shaking the contamination from his
fingers. Suddenly his eye fell upon
the great blue letter, and, abruptly
dismissing Mirabeau, he said: “By
the way, what a formidable document
that is that I brought you
just now! Has it anything to do
with the Revolution?”</p>

<p>Raymond shook his head and
smothered a rising sigh.</p>

<p>“It has been as good as a revolution
to me, at any rate.”</p>

<p>“My dear Bourbonais, what is
it? Nothing seriously amiss, I
hope?” exclaimed Sir Simon, full
of alarmed interest.</p>

<p>The count took up the letter and
handed it to him.</p>

<p>“Good heavens! Bankrupt! Can
pay nothing! How much had you
in it?”</p>

<p>“Nearly two hundred&mdash;the savings
of the last fourteen years,”
replied M. de la Bourbonais calmly.</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, I’m heartily
sorry!” exclaimed his friend in an
accent of sincere distress; “with
all my heart I’m sorry! And to
think of you having read this and
said nothing, and I raving away
about my own troubles like a selfish
dog as I am! Why did you not
tell me at once?”</p>

<p>“What good would it have done?”
Raymond shrugged his shoulders,
and with another involuntary sigh
threw the letter on the table. “It’s
hard, though. I was so little prepared
for it; the house bore such a
good name.…”</p>

<p>“I should have said it was the
safest bank in the country. So it
was, very likely; only one did not
reckon with the dishonesty of this
scheming villain of a partner&mdash;if it
be true that he is the cause of it.”</p>

<p>“No doubt it is; why should
they tell lies about it? The whole
affair will be in the papers one of
these days, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“And you can stand there and
not curse the villain!”</p>

<p>“What good would cursing him
do? It would not bring back my
poor scrapings.” Raymond laughed
gently. “I dare say his own conscience
will curse him before long&mdash;the
unhappy man! But who knows
what terrible temptation may have
driven him to the deed? Perhaps
he got into some difficulty that nothing
else could extricate him from,
and he may have had a wife and
children pulling at his conscience
by his heart-strings! Libera nos a
malo, Domine!” And looking upwards,
Raymond sighed again.</p>

<p>“What a strange being you are,
Raymond!” exclaimed Sir Simon,
eyeing him curiously. “Verily, I
believe your philosophy is worth
something after all.”</p>

<p>M. de la Bourbonais laughed outright.
“Well, it’s worth nearly the
money to have brought you to
that!”</p>

<p>“To see you stand there coolly
and philosophize about the motives
that may possibly have led an unprincipled
scoundrel to rob you of
every penny you possessed! Many
a man has got a fit from less.”</p>

<p>“Many a fool, perhaps; but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
would be a poor sort of man that
such a blow would send into a fit!”
returned the count with mild contempt.
“But I must not be forgetful
of the difference of conditions,”
he added quickly. “It all depends
on what the money is worth to one,
and what its loss involves. I don’t
want it at present. It was a little
hoard for the rainy day; and&mdash;qui
sait?&mdash;the rainy day may never
come!”</p>

<p>“No; Franceline may marry a
rich man,” suggested the baronet,
not with any intent to wound.</p>

<p>“Just so! I may never want the
money, and so never be the poorer
for losing it.”</p>

<p>“And supposing there was at
this moment some pressing necessity
for it&mdash;that your child was in
absolute need of it for some reason
or other&mdash;what then?” queried Sir
Simon.</p>

<p>Raymond winced and started
imperceptibly, as if a pain went
through him.</p>

<p>“Thank heaven there is no necessity
to answer that,” he said.
“We were taught to pray to be delivered
from temptation; let us be
thankful when we are, and not set
imaginary traps for ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Some men are, I believe, born
proof against temptation; I should
say you are one of them, Bourbonais,”
said his friend, looking steadily
at him.</p>

<p>“You are mistaken,” replied Raymond
quietly. “I don’t know
whether any human being may be
born with that sort of fire-proof
covering; but I know for certain
that I was not.”</p>

<p>“Can you, then, conceive yourself
under a pressure of temptation so
strong as that your principles, your
conscience, would give way? Can
you imagine yourself telling a deliberate
lie, for instance, or doing a
deliberate wrong to some one, in
order to save yourself&mdash;or, better,
your child&mdash;from some grievous
harm?”</p>

<p>Raymond thought for a moment,
as if he were poising a balance in
his mind before he answered; then
he said, speaking with slow emphasis,
as if every word was being
weighed in the scales: “Yes, I
can fancy myself giving way, if, at
such a crisis as you describe, I were
left to myself, with only my own
strength to lean on; but I hope I
should not be left to it. I hope I
should ask to be delivered from it.”</p>

<p>The humility of the avowal went
further to deepen Sir Simon’s faith
in his friend’s integrity and in the
strength of his principles than the
boldest self-assertion could have
done. It informed him, too, of the
existence of a certain ingredient in
Raymond’s philosophy which the
careless and light-hearted man of
the world had not till then suspected.</p>

<p>“One thing I know,” he said,
taking up his hat, and extending a
hand to M. de la Bourbonais: “if
your conscience were ever to play
you false, it would make an end of
my faith in all mankind&mdash;and in
something more.”</p>

<h3>QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE SYLLABUS.<br />
<span class="smaller">DOCTRINAL AUTHORITY OF THE SYLLABUS.<br />
FROM LES ETUDES RELIGIEUSES, ETC.</span></h3>

<p>We enter on a work whose practical
usefulness no one, we suspect,
will dispute, since it concerns perhaps
the most memorable act of
the reign of Pius IX.&mdash;the Syllabus.
There has been a great deal of discussion
about the Syllabus&mdash;much
has been written on it in the way
both of attack and defence&mdash;but
it is remarkable that it has scarcely
been studied at all. The remark
was made by one of the editors of
this review, Father Marquigny, in
the General Congress of Catholic
Committees at Paris; and, so true
was it felt to be, that it provoked
the approving laughter of the whole
assembly. But to pass by those
who busy themselves about this
document without having read it,
how many are there, even among
Catholics, who, after having read it,
have only the most vague and confused
notions about it&mdash;how many
who, if they were asked, “What
does the Syllabus teach you;
what does it make obligatory on
you?” would not know what to answer!
Thus is man constituted. He
skims willingly over the surface of
things; but he has no fancy for stopping
awhile and digging underneath.
If he is pleased with looking at a
great many things, he does not
equally concern himself to gain
knowledge; because there is no
true science without labor, and labor
is troublesome. Yet nothing
could be more desirable for him
than to come by this luminous
entrance from the knowledge to
the possession of truth. Christian
faith, when it is living and active,
necessarily experiences the desire
of it; for, according to the beautiful
saying of S. Anselm, it is, by its
very nature, a seeker of science&mdash;of
knowing: <i lang="la">Fides quærens intellectum</i>.</p>

<p>But, not to delay ourselves by
these considerations, is it possible
to exaggerate the importance of
the study of the Syllabus in the critical
circumstances in which we are
placed? The uncertainty of the
future; the impossibility of discovering
a satisfactory course in the
midst of the shadows which surround
us; the need of knowing
what to seize a firm hold of in
the formidable problems whose obscurity
agitates, in these days, the
strongest minds; above all, the furious
assaults of the enemies of the
church, and the authority belonging
to a solemn admonition coming
to us from the chair of truth&mdash;all
these things teach us plainly enough
how culpable it must be for us to
remain indifferent and to neglect
the illumination offered to us. The
teachings of the Vicar of Jesus
Christ deserve to be meditated on
at leisure. It is this which inspires
us with a hope that our work
will be favorably received. Truth,
moreover, claims the services of all,
even of the feeblest, and we must
not desert her cause for fear our
ability may not suffice for her defence.</p>

<p>Certainly, no one will expect us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
here, to give an analytical exposition
of the eighty propositions condemned
by Pius IX. Several numbers
of the <cite>Etudes</cite> would scarcely
suffice for that. General questions
dominate all others; it is to the
careful solution of these that we
shall devote ourselves. They have
always appeared to us to need clear
and decisive explanation. Often
they are incorrectly proposed, oftener
still they are ill-defined. The
object of our efforts will be to
point out with precision the limits
within which they must be restrained,
the sense in which they
must be accepted, and their necessary
import; then, to give them, as
clearly as we are able, a solution
the most sure and the most
conformable to first principles. If
it should be objected that in this
we are entering on a wide theological
field, we shall not deny it.
Proudhon, who desired anarchy in
things, in principles&mdash;everywhere,
in fact, except in reasoning&mdash;averred
that rigorous syllogism lands us inevitably
at theology. How, then,
would it be possible not to find it
in the Syllabus? They, on the
other hand, who are unceasing in
their violent attacks on this pontifical
act, are they not the first to
provoke theological discussions?
We are compelled to take their
ground. As Mgr. Dupanloup judiciously
observed, in his pamphlet
on the Encyclical of the 8th December:
“It is needful to recur to
first principles in a time when thousands
of men, and of women even,
in France talk theology from morning
to night without knowing much
about it.”</p>

<p>The first and fundamental question
to be determined is: What
is the precise weight to be ascribed
to the Syllabus, or, rather, what is its
doctrinal authority? On the manner
in which we reply to this depends
the solution of numerous
practical difficulties which interest
consciences, and which have more
than once been the subject of the
polemic of the journals themselves.
For example, are the decisions of
the Syllabus unchangeable; is it
not possible that they should be
modified some day; is it certain
they will never be withdrawn; are
Catholics obliged to accept them as
an absolute rule of their beliefs, or
may they content themselves with
doing nothing exteriorly in opposition
to them? It is understood, in
fact, that if we are in presence of
an act wherein the successor of S.
Peter exercises his sovereign and
infallible authority, the doctrine is
irrevocably, eternally, fixed without
possible recall; and, by an inevitable
corollary, the most complete
submission, not of the heart only,
but also of the intelligence, becomes
an obligation binding on the
conscience of the Catholic which
admits of no reserve or subterfuge.
If, on the contrary, the step taken
by the Pope is merely an act of
good administration or discipline,
the door remains open for hopes
of future changes, the constraint
imposed on the minds of men in
the interior forum is much less rigorous;
a caviller would remain in
Catholic unity provided that, with
the respectful silence so dear to
the Jansenists, he should also practise
proper obedience. Now, the
question, in the terms in which we
have stated it, although treated of
at various times by writers of merit,
has not always been handled in a
complete manner. Writers have
been too often contented with generalities,
with approaching only the
question, and nothing has been precisely
determined.</p>

<p>Some have asserted, with much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
energy, the necessity of this submission,
but they have not sufficiently
defined its extent and nature.
Others have dwelt upon the
deference and profound respect with
which every word of the Holy Father
should be received, but, not having
given any further explanation, they
have left us without the necessary
means for ascertaining what precisely
they intended. Others have
ventured to insinuate that the Syllabus
was perhaps merely an admonition,
a paternal advice benevolently
given to some rash children,
to which such as are docile are happy
to conform, without feeling themselves
under the absolute necessity
of adopting it. Others, more adventurous
still, have been unwilling
to see more in it than a mere piece
of information, an indication. According
to these, Pius IX., wishing
to notify to all the bishops of Christendom
his principal authoritative
acts since the commencement of his
pontificate, had caused a list of
them to be drawn out, and to be
forwarded to them. The Syllabus
was this illustrious catalogue, neither
more nor less.</p>

<p>Is there any excuse to be found
for this indecision on one hand,
presumption on the other? We do
not think so; but they do, we must
confess, admit of a plausible explanation.
And here, let it be observed,
we come to the very marrow
of the difficulty. The Syllabus was
drawn out in an unusual form. It
resembles no pontifical documents
hitherto published. When, in other
times, the sovereign pontiffs wished
to stigmatize erroneous propositions,
they did not content themselves
with reproducing the terms
of them, in order to mark them out
for the reprobation of the people.
They were always careful to explain
the motives of the judgment
they delivered, and above all to
formulate with clearness and precision
the judgment itself. Invariably,
the texts they singled out for
condemnation were preceded by
grave and weighty words, wherein
were explained the reasons for and
the nature of the condemnation. In
the Syllabus, there is nothing of the
kind. The propositions, stated
without commentary, are classified
and distributed under general titles;
at the end of each of them we read
the indication of the Encyclical
Letter, or pontifical Allocution, in
which it had been previously rebuked.
For the rest, there is no
preamble, no conclusion, no discourse
revealing the mind or intention
of the pontiff, unless it be the
following words, inscribed at the
head of the document, and which
we here give both in the Latin and
in English: <i lang="la">Syllabus complectens
præcipuos nostræ ætatis errores, qui
notantur in Allocutionibus consistorialibus,
in Encyclicis, aliisque Apostolicis
Litteris sanctissimi Domini
Papæ Pii IX.</i>&mdash;Table, or synopsis,
containing the principal errors of
our epoch, noted in the consistorial
Allocutions, the Encyclicals, and
other Apostolic Letters of our most
Holy Father, Pope Pius IX.</p>

<p>We may add, that nowhere does
the Pope formally express an intention
of connecting the Syllabus with
the bull <cite>Quanta cura</cite>, although he
issued them both on the same day,
at the same hour, under the same
circumstances, and upon the same
subjects. He left it to the public
common sense and to the faith of
Christians to decide whether these
two acts are to be taken together,
or whether they are to be considered
as isolated acts having no
common tie between them.</p>

<p>Such are the facts. Minds, either
troubled or prejudiced, or, may be,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
too astute, have drawn from them
consequences which, if we lay aside
accessory details of not much importance
here, we may reduce to
two principal ones.</p>

<p>It has been stated&mdash;and they
who hold this language form, as it
were, the extreme group of opposers&mdash;that
the Apostolic Letters
mentioned in the Syllabus are the
only documents which have authoritative
force; that the latter, on
the contrary, has no proper weight
of its own&mdash;absolutely none, whether
as a dogmatic definition, or as a
disciplinary measure, or even as a
moral and intellectual direction.
To these assertions, not a little
hazardous, have been added others
whose rashness would fain be hidden
under the veil of rhetorical
artifices. We will lift the veil, and
expose the naked assertions. The
meaning of the Syllabus, it is stated,
must not be looked for in the Syllabus,
but in the pontifical letters
whence it is drawn. The study of
the letters may be useful; not only
is that of the Syllabus not so, but it
is dangerous, because it often leads
to lamentable exaggerations. To
know the true doctrines of Rome,
we must search the letters for them,
not the Syllabus. In fact, to sum
up all in a few words, as a condemnation
of error and a manifestation
of truth, the letters are all, the Syllabus
nothing.</p>

<p>The other group, which we may
describe as the moderates, knows
how to guard itself against excess.
It does not diminish the authority
of the Syllabus to the extent of annihilation.
Very far from it&mdash;it
recognizes it and proclaims it aloud;
but, struck with the peculiar form
given to the act, it asserts that it is
impossible to discover in it the
marks of a dogmatic definition, and,
to borrow a stock expression, of a
definition <i lang="la">ex cathedra</i>. The Syllabus,
it is said, is undoubtedly something
by itself&mdash;to deny it would
be ridiculous and absurd. It has a
weight of its own; who would venture
to dispute it? It may be
termed, if you please, an universal
law of the church, so only that its
pretensions be not carried further,
and that it does not claim to be
considered an infallible decision of
the Vicar of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>What, then, have we to do but to
demonstrate that the Syllabus is by
itself, and independently of the pontifical
acts which supply the matter
of it, a veritable teaching; that this
teaching obliges consciences because
it issues from the infallible
authority of the head of the church?
We shall not have omitted, it seems
to us, any of the considerations calculated
to throw light on this important
subject if, after having thus
followed it through all its windings
and discussed all its difficulties, we
succeed in illustrating the triple
character of the pontifical act&mdash;its
doctrinal character, its obligatory
character, and its character of infallibility.</p>

<p>To assert that Pius IX., when he
denounced with so much firmness
to the Christian world the errors of
our time, did not propose to teach
us anything, that he had no intention
of instructing us, was, even at
the time of the appearance of the
Syllabus, to advance a sufficiently
hardy paradox; but to state it, to
maintain it, at this time of day,
when we are the fortunate witnesses
of the effects produced by that immortal
act, is to speak against evidence.
Undoubtedly&mdash;we stated it
at the commencement&mdash;the Syllabus
is not sufficiently known nor sufficiently
studied. Little known as it
may be, however, it cannot be denied
that it has already set right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
many ideas, and corrected and enlightened
many minds. Thanks to
it, not learned men only and those
who are close observers of events,
but Catholics generally, perceive
more clearly the dangers with which
certain doctrines threaten their
faith. They have been warned,
they keep themselves on their guard,
they see more distinctly the course
they must follow and the shoals
they must avoid. Pius IX. has
lighted a torch and placed it in their
hands.</p>

<p>That being the case, what is the
use of playing with words, as if vain
subtleties could destroy the striking
evidence of this fact? Let them
say, as often as they please, “The
Syllabus is only a list, a catalogue,
a table of contents, a memorial of
previously condemned propositions”&mdash;what
good will they have
done? What matter these denominations,
more or less disrespectful,
if it be otherwise demonstrated that
this list, catalogue, or table of contents
explains to us exactly what
we must believe or reject, and is
imposed upon us as a rule to which
we owe subjection. The imprudent
persons who speak thus would
seem never to have studied the
monuments of our beliefs. Had
they considered their nature more
attentively, would they have allowed
themselves to indulge in such intemperance
of language? If they
would more closely examine them,
their illusions would soon be dissipated.
Are not all the series of
propositions condemned by the
Popes, veritable lists? Did not Martin
V. and the Council of Constance,
Leo X. and S. Pius V., when they
smote with their anathemas the
errors of Wycliffe, John Huss,
Luther, Baïus, draw out catalogues?
Are not the canons of our councils
tables in which are inscribed an
abridgment, summary, or epitome
of the impious doctrines of heretics?
Is not every solemn definition,
every symbol of the faith, a memorial
designed to remind the Christian
what he is obliged to believe?
It is, then, useless to shelter one’s
self behind words of doubtful meaning,
and which can only perplex the
mind without enlightening it. It is
to assume gratuitously the air of
men who wish to deceive others and
to deceive themselves. What is the
use of it?</p>

<p>They are much mistaken who imagine
themselves to be proposing a
serious difficulty when they demand
how the Syllabus, which, before its
publication, existed already in the
letters of the Holy Father, can possibly
teach us anything new? Let
us, for the sake of argument, since
they ask it, reduce it to the humble
<i lang="fr">rôle</i> of echo or reverberator, if we
may be pardoned such expressions.
Let us suppose that its whole action
consists in repeating what has been
already said. We ask if an echo
does not often convey to the ear
a sound which, without it, would
not have been heard&mdash;if it does not
sometimes send back the sound
stronger, more resounding, and
even more distinct than the original
voice? It is not a new voice it
brings to us. Be it so. But it does
bring it to us in fact, and is able to
give it to us again fuller and more
sonorous.</p>

<p>Comparison, it is true, is not reason.
We will therefore abandon
the redundancy of figurative language,
and reply directly to the
question put to us. What is wanted
is to know what the Syllabus is
in itself, independently of the pontifical
letters which are its original
sources. It is as follows:</p>

<p>It is, at least, a new promulgation,
more universal, more authentic, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
therefore more efficacious, of previous
condemnations. Now, it is
well known, it is a maxim of law,
that a second promulgation powerfully
confirms and, in case of need,
supersedes the first. The history
of human legislation is full of instances
of this. When, by reason
of the negligence of men, of the difficulty
of the times, of the inconstancy
or waywardness of peoples, a
law has fallen into partial neglect
and oblivion, they in whom the sovereign
power resides re-establish its
failing authority by promulgating
it anew. It revives thus, and if it
has been defunct it receives a second
life. What can the greater
number of Christians know of so
many scattered condemnations,
buried, one may say, in the voluminous
collection of pontifical encyclicals,
if the Syllabus had not
revealed them? How could they
respect them, how obey them?
It was necessary that they should
hear them resound, in a manner, a
second time, in the utterance of the
great Pontiff, in order to be able
to submit anew to their authority,
and to resume a yoke of which many
of them did not know the very
existence. The salvation of the
church required this.</p>

<p>The Syllabus is, however, not
only a new promulgation, it is often
a luminous interpretation of the
original documents to which it relates;
an interpretation at times so
necessary that, should it disappear,
from that moment the meaning of
those documents would become, on
many points, obscure or at least
doubtful. It is worthy of remark
that in order to deny the doctrinal
value of the Syllabus the following
fact is relied on&mdash;that it is unaccompanied
with any explanation,
with any reflections. “It is a dry
nomenclature,” it has been said,
“of which we cannot determine
either the character or the end.”
Now, it happens to be exactly here
that brevity has brought forth light.
The eighty-four propositions, in
fact, isolated from their context,
appear to us more exact, in stronger
relief, more decidedly drawn.
One may perceive that in the bulls
their forms were, as yet, slightly indistinct;
here they detach themselves
vividly, and with remarkable
vigor. And we wish that all our
readers were able to judge of this
for themselves. They would better
understand, possibly, wherefore
certain men insist with so much
energy on our abandoning the
Syllabus and applying ourselves
exclusively to the sources&mdash;an excellent
mode of preventing certain
questions from becoming too clear.</p>

<p>We will cite a few examples in illustration
of our argument.</p>

<p>The second paragraph of the
Syllabus has for its object the condemnation
of <em>moderate rationalism</em>.
Some of the seven propositions
contained in it reproduce the doctrine
of a man little known in
France, but much thought of in
Germany&mdash;a kind of independent
Catholic, who, before he opposed
himself to the church, from which
he is now, we believe, quite separated,
having transferred his allegiance
to the pastoral staff of the
aged Reinkens, wrote some works
destined to sow among the students
of the university of Munich the
damaged grain of infidel science.
We allude to M. Froschammer, a
canon who has lost his hood, professor
of misty philosophy, as befits
a doctor on the other side of the
Rhine. Pius IX. rebuked his errors
in a letter addressed to the
Archbishop of Munich the 12th
December, 1862. We will lay aside
the Syllabus, and take merely the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
letter. We shall find in it only the
condemnation of M. Froschammer
and his works; nothing whatever
else. But who, in this our country,
France, has ever opened the works
of M. Froschammer? The Catholic
Frenchman who might read the
letter of Pius IX. knowing nothing
of the condemned works, would say
to himself: “This Munich professor
has doubtless written according
to his own fancy; he must have
been rash, as every good German is
bound to be who loses himself in
the shadowy mazes of metaphysics.
After all, there is nothing to show
that he has written exactly my
opinions. Why should I trouble
myself about the letter of Pius
IX.? It does not concern me.”</p>

<p>Another example. In Paragraph
X. we find the same principle of
modern liberalism enunciated in
the following manner: “In this our
age, it is no longer expedient that
the Catholic religion should be
considered as the only religion of
the state, to the exclusion of
all others.” “Ætate hac nostra,
non amplius expedit religionem
Catholicam haberi, tanquam unicam
status religionem, cæteris quibuscumque
cultibus exclusis.” The
document to which we refer is a
consistorial Allocution pronounced
the 26th July, 1855, and it commences
with these words, <i lang="la">Nemo
vestrum</i>. What is this Allocution?
A solemn protest against the criminality
of the Spanish government,
which, in contempt of its word and
oath, of the rights of the church
and the eternal laws of justice, had
dared to perjure itself by abrogating,
of its own single authority,
the first and second articles of the
concordat. Pius IX., full of grief,
speaks in these terms: “You know,
venerable brethren, how, in this
convention, amongst all the decisions
relative to the interests of the
Catholic religion, we have, above
all, established that this holy religion
should continue to be the only
religion of the Spanish nation, to
the exclusion of every other worship.”
The proposition of the Syllabus
is not expressed in any other
way in the Allocution. A man of
great ability, or a scientific man,
taking into account the facts, and
weighing carefully the expressions
of the Pontiff, might perhaps detect
it therein. But how many others
would it wholly escape! How many
would not perceive it, or, if they
should chance to catch sight of it,
would remain in suspense, uncertain
which was rebuked, the application
of the doctrine or the doctrine
itself! How many, in short,
would be unwilling to recognize, in
these words, aught but the sorrowful
complaint of the Vicar of
Jesus Christ outraged in his dearest
rights! Return, however, to the
Syllabus, and that which was obscure
comes to light and manifests
itself clearly. The two propositions
we have cited do not appear,
in it, confused or uncertain. Detached,
on the contrary, from the
particular circumstances which were
calculated to weaken their meaning,
and clad in a form more lofty,
more universal, more abstract, they
receive an unspeakable signification.
No hesitation is possible.
It is no longer the doctrine of M.
Froschammer, nor the sacrilegious
usurpations of the Spanish government,
which are rebuked; it is but
the doctrine considered in itself
and in its substance. And since
the Roman Pontiff, after having isolated
it, fixes on it a mark of reprobation
by declaring it erroneous,
he denounces it to all ages and all
people as deserving the everlasting
censure of the church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>It is for this reason, as far as ourselves,
at least, are concerned, we
shall never accept without restriction
a phrase which we find, under
one form or other, in all directions,
even from the pen of writers for
whom we entertain, in other respects,
the highest esteem: “The
Syllabus has only a relative value, a
value subordinate to that of the
pontifical documents of which it is
the epitome.” No! We are unable
to admit an appreciation of
it, in our opinion, so full of danger.
We must not allow ourselves
to weaken truth if we would maintain
its salutary dominion over
souls. They talk of the value of
the Syllabus. What is meant by
this? Its authority? It derives
that most undoubtedly from itself,
and from the sovereign power of
him who published it. It is as
much an act of that supreme authority
as the letters or encyclicals
to which it alludes. The meaning
of the propositions it contains?
Doubtless many of these, if we
thus refer to their origin, will receive
from it a certain illustration.
Others, and they are not the fewest,
will either lose there their precision,
or will rather shed more light upon
it than they receive from it.
Between the two assertions&mdash;The
pontifical letters explain the Syllabus,
and, The Syllabus explains the
pontifical letters&mdash;the second is, with
a few exceptions, the most rigorously
true. A very simple argument
demonstrates it. Suppose that, by
accident or an unforeseen catastrophe,
one or other of these documents
were to perish and not leave
any trace of its existence, which
is the one whose preservation we
should most have desired, in order
that the mind of Pius IX. and the
judgment of the church concerning
the errors of our age might be
transmitted more surely to future
generations?</p>

<p>Most fertile in subtleties is the
mind of man when he wishes to escape
from a duty that molests him.
We must not, consequently, be astonished
if many opponents of the
Syllabus have lighted on ingenious
distinctions which allow of their almost
admitting, in theory, the doctrines
we have just explained, whilst
contriving to elude their practical
consequences. For that, what have
they done? They have acknowledged
the real authority of this
grand act in so far as it is a doctrinal
declaration, or, if it is preferred,
a manifestation of doctrine;
adding, nevertheless, that the Pope
has not imposed it on us in the way
of obligation, but <em>only in the way
of guidance</em>. The expression, only
in the way of guidance, would have
been a happy enough invention,
had it been possible, in matter so
important, and in an act so solemn,
to imagine a guidance truly efficacious&mdash;such,
for instance, as the
Pope could not but wish it to be&mdash;which
would not be an obligation.
But we ourselves must avoid reasoning
with too much subtlety, and
content ourselves with opposing a
difficulty more specious than solid
with a few positive proofs.</p>

<p>We interpose, in the first place,
the very title of the Syllabus:
“Table, or abridgment, of the principal
errors of our time, pointed
out in consistorial Allocutions,”
etc. To which we add the titles
of various paragraphs: “Errors in
relation to the church”; “Errors
in relation to civil society”; “Errors
concerning natural and Christian
morals,” etc. For the Pope,
the guardian and protector of truth,
obliged by the duty of his office to
hinder the church from suffering
any decline or any alteration, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
denounce to the Christian world a
doctrine by inflicting on it the
brand of error, is evidently to forbid
the employment of it, and to
command all the faithful to eschew
it. What communion is there between
light and darkness, between
life and death? There can be no
question about guidance or counsel
when the supreme interest is at
stake. The duty speaks for itself.
It is imposed by the nature of
things. When Pius IX. placed at
the head of his Syllabus the word
“error,” and intensified it by adding
words even more significant,
when he expressed himself thus,
“Principal errors of this our age,”
he as good as said, “Here is death!
Avoid it.” And if, in order still to
escape from the consequences, a
distinction is attempted to be drawn
between an obligation created by
the force of circumstances and an
obligation imposed by the legislator,
we would wish it to be remembered
that the same Pius IX. uttered, in
reference to the Syllabus, the following
memorable sentence: “When
the Pope speaks in a solemn act, it
is to be taken literally; what he
has said, he intended to say.” For
our part, we would say, “What the
Pope has done, he intended to do.”</p>

<p>But what need is there of so
much discussion? The proof of
what we have urged is written in
express terms in the letter accompanying
the Syllabus&mdash;a letter signed
by his eminence Cardinal Antonelli,
secretary of state, and intended
to make known to the bishops
the will of His Holiness. It
is sufficient to quote this decisive
document, which we do in full, on
account of its importance:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">Most Reverend Excellency</span>:</p>

<p>“Our Holy Father, Pope Pius IX., profoundly
solicitous for the safety of souls
and of holy doctrine, has never ceased,
since the commencement of his pontificate,
to proscribe and to condemn by his
encyclicals, his consistorial Allocutions,
and other apostolic letters already published,
the most important errors and
false doctrines, above all, those of our unhappy
times. But since it may come to
pass that all the political acts reach not
every one of the ordinaries, it has seemed
good to the same sovereign Pontiff that a
Syllabus should be drawn out of these same
errors, to be sent to all the bishops of
the Catholic world, <em>in order that these
same bishops may have before their eyes all
the errors and pernicious doctrines which
have been reproved and condemned by him</em>.
He has therefore commanded me to see
that this printed Syllabus be sent to your
most reverend excellency, on this occasion,
and at this time. When the same
sovereign Pontiff, in consequence of his
great solicitude for the safety and well-being
of the Catholic Church, and of the
whole flock which has been divinely committed
to him by the Lord, has thought
it expedient to write another encyclical
letter to all the Catholic bishops, thus
executing, as is my duty, with all befitting
zeal and respect, the orders of the same
Pontiff, I hasten to send to your excellency
this Syllabus with this letter.”</p>

</div>

<p>This Syllabus, placed by the order
of the Holy Father “before the eyes
of all the bishops,” what else is it,
we ask, than the text of the law
brought under the observation of
the judges charged with the duty
of causing it to be executed? What
is it except a rule to which they owe
allegiance, and from which they
must not swerve? They must not
lose sight of it. Wherefore? Because
it is their duty to be careful
to promulgate its doctrine in their
own teaching, because it is their
duty to repress every rash opinion
which should dare to raise itself
against and contradict it. It is
thus that all have understood the
commandment given to them. The
fidelity and unconquerable courage
of their obedience prove it. What
has taken place in France? In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the midst of the universal emotion
produced by the appearance of the
Syllabus, the government, abusing
its power, had the sad audacity to
constitute itself judge of it. Through
the instrumentality of the keeper of
the seals, minister of justice and of
public worship, it forbade the publication
of the pontifical document
in any pastoral instruction, alleging
that “it contained propositions
contrary to the principles on which
the constitution of the empire rests.”
What was the unanimous voice of
the episcopate? Eighty-four letters
of bishops are in existence to bear
witness to it. All, united in the
same mind, opposed to the ministerial
letter the invincible word of
the apostles, <i lang="la">Non possumus</i>. All declared
that they must obey God
rather then man; and two amongst
them, ascending courageously their
cathedral thrones, braved the menaces
of a susceptible government
by reading before the assembled
people that which they had been
forbidden to print. Could they
have acted all alike with this
power truly episcopal, if they had
not been inspired by the conviction
that they were fulfilling a duty, and
putting into practice the adage of
the Christian knights, “I do my
duty, happen what may”?</p>

<p>We will insist no further on this
point. We approach, lastly, the
question which might well supersede
all the others. Let us enquire
whether the Syllabus is an infallible
decision of the Vicar of Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p>It appears to us that, in reality,
we have already settled this question.
Can a definition <i lang="la">ex cathedra</i>
be anything else than an instruction
concerning faith and morals addressed
to, and imposed on, the
whole church by her visible head
upon earth? How can we recognize
it except by this mark, and is
not that the idea given to us of it
by the Council of the Vatican?
Read over the words, so weighty
and selected with so much care by
the fathers of that august assembly,
and you will find that nothing
could express more accurately the
exact and precise notion of it.
After that, all doubts ought to disappear.
The Syllabus emanates
from him who is the master and sovereign
doctor of Catholic truth. It
belongs exclusively to faith and
morals by the nature of the subjects
of which it treats. It has received
from the circumstances which have
accompanied its publication the
manifest character of an universal
law of the church. What is wanting
to it to be an irreformable decision,
an act without appeal, of the
infallible authority of Peter?</p>

<p>We know the objection with
which we shall be met. Peter may
speak, it will be urged, and not
wish to exert the plenitude of his
doctrinal power. Yes; but when
he restrains thus within voluntary
limits the exercise of his authority,
he gives us to understand it clearly.
He is careful, in order not to
overtax our weakness, to apprise
us that, notwithstanding the obligation
with which he binds consciences,
it is not in his mind, as
yet, to deliver a definitive sentence
upon the doctrine. Frankly, does
the Syllabus offer to us an indication,
however faint, of any such reserve?
What more definitive than
a judgment formulated in these
terms: “This is error, that is truth”?
Is any revision possible of such a
judgment? Is it possible to be revoked
or abrogated? Does it not
settle us necessarily in an absolute
conclusion which excludes all possibility
of diminution or of change?
In a word, can the assertion be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
ever permissible&mdash;“Error in these
days, truth in others”? It may be
added that, by the admission of all,
friends and enemies&mdash;an admission
confirmed by the declaration of the
cardinal secretary of state, the Syllabus
is an appendix to, and as it
were a continuation of, the bull
<cite>Quanta cura</cite>, to which no one can
reasonably refuse the character of a
definitive and irreformable decree;
and it will be understood how unreasonable
it would be to despise
the evidence of facts, in order to
cling to an objection without consistency,
and which falls of itself for
want of a solid foundation.</p>

<p>For the rest, the mind of the
Holy Father is not concealed, as
has been at times suggested, under
impenetrable veils. It appears the
moment we look for it; and we
find it, for example, in the preparation
of the Syllabus. It should be
known that the Syllabus was not
the work of a day. Pius IX. has
often asserted this. He had early
resolved to strike a signal blow, and
to destroy from top to bottom the
monstrous edifice of revolutionary
doctrines. To this end, immediately
after the proclamation of the
dogma of the Immaculate Conception,
he transformed the congregation
of cardinals and theologians
who had aided him in the accomplishment
of that work into a congregation
charged with the duty of
singling out for the Apostolic See
the new errors which, for a century,
had been ravaging the church of
God. Ten years passed away;
encyclicals were published, allocutions
pronounced; the theologians
multiplied their labors. At
length, on the 8th of December, 1864,
the moment of action appearing to
have arrived, Pius IX. addressed
to the world that utterance whose
prolonged echoes we all have heard.
The bull <cite>Quanta cura</cite> and the Syllabus
were promulgated. It is obvious
that an act so long prepared,
and with so much anxiety, cannot
be likened to an ordinary act. The
object of the Pontiff was not simply
to check the evil&mdash;it was to uproot
it. The object of such efforts
could not have been to determine
nothing. Who is there, then, who
will venture to assert that the whole
thought of an entire reign, and of
such a reign as that of Pius IX.,
should miserably collapse in a
measure without authority and
without effectiveness? To believe
it would be an outrage; to affirm
it would be an insult to the wisdom
and prudence of the most glorious
of pontiffs.</p>

<p>But what need is there for searching
for proofs? A single reflection
banishes every difficulty. We have
in the church two means for ascertaining
whether a pontifical act is,
or is not, a sovereign definition, an
infallible decision. We have to
enquire of the pontiff who is the
author of it, or the people who subordinate
themselves to his teaching.
Neither one nor the other can deceive
us in the answer they give.
The divine promise continues equally
assured in both: in the former,
when he teaches; in the latter, when
they listen and obey. It is what
the theologians call active and passive
infallibility. Admit that Pius
IX. had left us in ignorance; that
he published the Syllabus, but did
not tell us what amount of assent
he required of us. Well, none of
us are in any doubt as to that.
How many times has not this people
said, how many times has it not
repeated with an enthusiasm inspired
by love, that this Syllabus,
despised, insulted by the enemies
of the church, they accept as the
rule of their beliefs, as the very word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
of Peter, as the word of life come
down from heaven to save us. Is
it not thus that have spoken, one
after the other, bishops, theologians,
the learned and the ignorant, the
mighty and the humble? Who
amongst us has not heard this language?
A celebrated doctor, Tanner,
has said that in order to distinguish
amongst the teachings of
the church those which belong to
its infallible authority, we must
listen to the judgment of wise men,
and above all consult the universal
sentiment of Christians. If we adhere
to this decision, it reveals to
us our duties in regard to the
sovereign act by which Pius IX.
has withdrawn the world from the
shadow in which it was losing its
way, and has prepared for it a future
of better destinies.</p>

<p>We have the more reason for
acting thus as hell, by its furious
hatred, gives us, for its part, a similar
warning, and proclaims, after its
fashion, the imperishable grandeur
of the Syllabus. Neither has it,
nor have those who serve it, ever
been under any illusion in this respect.
They have often revealed
their mind both by act and word.
What implacable indignation! what
torrents of insults! what clamor
without truce or mercy! And
when importunate conciliators interfered
to tell them they were mistaken,
that the Syllabus was nothing
or next to nothing, and need not
provoke so much anger, how well
they knew how to reply to them
and to bury them under the weight
of their contempt! At the end of
1864, at the moment when the
struggle occasioned by the promulgation
of the Encyclical and Syllabus
was the most furious, an agency
of Parisian publicity, the agency
Bullier, could insert the following
notice: “The Encyclical is not a
dogmatic bull, but only a doctrinal
letter. It is observable that the
Syllabus does not bear the signature
of the Pope. This Syllabus
has besides been published in a
manner to allow us to believe that
the Holy Father did not intend to
assign to it a great importance.
One may conclude, therefore, that
the propositions which do not attack
either the dogma or morals of
Catholics, and do not at all impeach
faith, are not condemned,
but merely blamed.” To these
words, poor in sense, but crafty
and treacherous in expression, the
journal <cite>Le Siècle</cite> replied as follows:</p>

<p>“There are now people who tell
us that the Encyclical is not a dogmatic
bull, but a doctrinal letter;
that the eighty propositions are not
condemned, because they do not
figure in the Encyclical, but only
in the Syllabus; that this Syllabus
does not bear the signature of the
Pope; that it has been composed
only by a commission of theologians,
etc. These people would do
better to be silent. Encyclical or
Syllabus, the fact is that the theocracy
has just hurled as haughty a
defiance against modern ideas as it
was possible for it to do. We shall
soon see what will be the result.”</p>

<p>We will leave them to settle their
quarrels between themselves. For
ourselves, listening to these voices
of heaven and of hell, of the church
and of the world, which coincide
in exalting the work eternally blessed
by Pius IX., we repeat with profounder
conviction than ever: “Yes,
the Syllabus is the infallible word
of Peter; and if our modern society
is within the reach of cure, it is by
the Syllabus that it is to be saved!”</p>

<h3>SIR THOMAS MORE.<br />
<i>A HISTORICAL ROMANCE.</i></h3>

<p class="center">FROM THE FRENCH OF THE PRINCESSE DE CRAON.</p>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p>In a sumptuous apartment,
whose magnificent furniture and
costly adornings announced it as
the abode of kings, in a large
Gothic arm-chair&mdash;whose massive
sides were decorated with carvings
in ebony and ivory of exquisite
delicacy, and which was in itself,
altogether, a model of the most
skilful workmanship&mdash;there reclined
the form of a stately and elegant
woman.</p>

<p>Her small feet, but half-concealed
beneath the heavy folds of a
rich blue velvet robe, rested on a
footstool covered with crimson
brocade, embroidered with golden
stars. Bands of pearls adorned her
beautiful neck, contrasted with its
dazzling whiteness, and were profusely
twined amid the raven
tresses of her luxuriant hair. An
expression of profound melancholy
was imprinted upon her noble features;
her eyes were cast down,
and the long, drooping lashes
were heavy with tears which she
seemed vainly endeavoring to repress,
as she sat absorbed in
thought, and nervously entwining
her snowy fingers with the silk and
jewelled cord which, according to
the fashion of that day, she wore
fastened at her girdle and hanging
to her feet. This royal personage
was Catherine of Aragon, daughter
of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain,
wife of Henry VIII., and queen of
England.</p>

<p>The king himself was hurriedly
pacing to and fro in the apartment,
with contracted brow, a
deeply troubled expression gleaming
from his dark eyes and obscuring,
with a shade of gloomy fierceness,
the naturally fine features of
his face. The ordinary grace of
his carriage had disappeared; his
step was hurried and irregular; and
every movement denoted a man
laboring under some violent excitement.
From time to time he approached
the window, and gazed
abstractedly into the distance;
then, returning to Catherine, he
would address her abruptly, with a
sharp expression or hurried interrogation,
neither waiting for nor
seeming to desire a reply.</p>

<p>While this strange scene was being
enacted within the palace at
Greenwich, one of an entirely different
nature was occurring in the
courtyard. From the road leading
from Greenwich a cavalcade approached,
headed by a personage
invested with the Roman purple,
and apparently entitled to and surrounded
by all the “pomp and
circumstance” of royalty. He
was mounted on a richly caparisoned
mule with silver-plated harness,
adorned with silver bells
and tufted with knots of crimson
silk. This distinguished personage
was no other than the Archbishop
of York, the potent minister, who
united in his person all the dignities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
both of church and state&mdash;the
Cardinal Legate, the king’s acknowledged
favorite, Wolsey. To
increase his already princely possessions,
to extend his influence
and authority, had been this man’s
constant endeavor, and the sole
aim of his life. And so complete
had been his success that he was
now regarded by all as an object
of admiration and envy. But how
greatly mistaken was the world in
its opinion!</p>

<p>In his heart, Wolsey suffered the
constant agony of a profound
humiliation. Compelled to yield
in all things, and bow with servile
submission to the haughty will of his
exacting and imperious master&mdash;who
by a word, and in a moment,
could deprive him of his dignities
and temporalities&mdash;he lived in a
state of constant dread, fearing to
lose the patronage and favor to secure
which he had sacrificed both
his honor and his conscience.</p>

<p>He was accompanied on this
journey by a numerous retinue,
composed of gentlemen attached to
his household and young pages
carrying his standard, all of
whom were eagerly pressing upon
him the most obsequious attentions.
They assisted him to dismount, and
as he approached the palace the
guards saluted and received him
with the utmost military deference
and respect; and with an air of
grave dignity Wolsey passed on, and
disappeared beneath the arch of the
grand stairway.</p>

<p>Let us again return to the royal
apartments. The king, seeing
Wolsey arrive, immediately turned
from the window and, confronting
Catherine, abruptly exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Come, madam, I wish you to
retire; the affairs of my kingdom
demand instantly all my time and
attention.” And hastily turning to
the window, he looked eagerly into
the courtyard.</p>

<p>Catherine arose without uttering
a word, and approaching the centre
of the apartment she took from the
table a small silver bell, and rang
it twice.</p>

<p>On this table was a magnificent
cloth cover that she had embroidered
with her own hands. The
design represented a tournament,
in which Henry, who was devoted
to chivalrous amusements, had borne
off the prize over all his competitors.
In those days her husband
received such presents with grateful
affection and sincere appreciation,
and, as the souvenir recalled
to her mind the joy and happiness
of the past, tears of bitterness flowed
afresh from the eyes of the unhappy
princess.</p>

<p>In answer to her signal, the door
soon opened, the queen’s ladies in
waiting appeared, and, arranging
themselves on either side, stood in
readiness to follow their royal mistress.
She passed out, and was
slowly walking in silence through
the vast gallery leading to the king’s
apartments, when Wolsey appeared,
advancing from the opposite
end of the gallery, followed by his
brilliant retinue.</p>

<p>Catherine, then, instantly understood
why the king had so abruptly
commanded her to retire. Suddenly
pausing, she stood transfixed
and immovable, her soul overwhelmed
with anguish; but, with a
countenance calm and impassible,
she awaited the approach of the
cardinal, who advanced to salute
her. In spite of all her efforts,
however, she could no longer control
her feelings.</p>

<p>“My lord cardinal,” she exclaimed
in a low voice, trembling with
emotion, “go, the king waits for
you!” And as she uttered these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
words, the unhappy woman fell
senseless to the floor.</p>

<p>The hardened soul of the ambitious
Wolsey was moved to its very
depths with compassion as he silently
gazed on the noble woman
before him, who possessed the unbounded
love and grateful esteem
of all her household, not only as
their sovereign, but also as their
beneficent mother.</p>

<p>The cloud of ambition that forever
surrounded him, darkening his
soul and obscuring his perceptions,
was for the moment illuminated,
and for the first time he realized
the enormity of Henry’s proceedings
against the queen.</p>

<p>As this sudden light flashed on
him, he felt remorse for having encouraged
the divorce, and resolved
that henceforward all his influence
should be used to dissuade his sovereign
from it.</p>

<p>At the approach of the royal favorite
the ushers hastily made their
salutations (although the queen
had been permitted to pass them
with scarcely the slightest mark of
respect), and seemed to consider
the most humble and servile attitude
they could assume before him
as only sufficiently respectful. They
hastened to throw open the doors
before him as he advanced, and
Wolsey soon found himself in the
presence of the king, who awaited
his arrival in a state of almost
angry impatience.</p>

<p>“Well! what do you come to
tell me?” he cried. “Do you bring
me good news?”</p>

<p>Wolsey, whose opinions had so
recently undergone a very great
change, for a moment hesitated.
“Sire,” he at length replied, “Campeggio,
the cardinal legate, has arrived.”</p>

<p>“Has he indeed?” said Henry,
with an ironical smile. “After so
many unsuccessful applications, we
have then, at last, obtained this favor.
Well, I hope now this affair
will proceed more rapidly; and,
Wolsey, remember that it is your
business so entirely to compromise
and surround this man, that he
shall not be able even to <em>think</em>
without my consent and sanction.
And, above all, beware of the intrigues
of the queen. Catherine is
a Spaniard, with an artful, unyielding
nature and fierce, indomitable
will. She will, without doubt, make
the most determined and desperate
effort to enlist the legate in favor
of her cause.”</p>

<p>“Is the decision of your majesty
irrevocable on the subject of this
divorce?” replied Wolsey, in a hesitating
and embarrassed manner.
“The farther we advance, the more
formidable the accumulating difficulties
become. I must acknowledge,
sire, I begin myself to doubt
of success. Campeggio has already
declared that, if the queen
appeals to Rome, he will not refuse
to present her petition, and defend
her cause; that he himself will decide
nothing, and will yield to nothing
he cannot conscientiously approve.”</p>

<p>On hearing Wolsey express these
sentiments, Henry’s face flushed
with rage, and a menacing scowl
contracted his brow.</p>

<p>“Can it be possible,” he cried,
“that you dare address me in this
manner? I will castigate the Pope
himself if he refuses his sanction.
He shall measure his power with
mine! He trembles because
Charles V. is already on his
frontier. I will make him tremble
now, in my turn! I will marry
Anne Boleyn&mdash;yes, I will marry her
before the eyes of the whole world!”</p>

<p>“What do you say, sire? Anne
Boleyn!” cried Wolsey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, Anne Boleyn!” replied the
king, regarding Wolsey with his
usual haughty and contemptuous
expression. “You know her well.
She is attached to the service of
Catherine.”</p>

<p>“Lady Anne Boleyn!” again
cried Wolsey after a moment’s silence,
for astonishment had almost
for the time rendered him
speechless and breathless. “Lady
Anne Boleyn! The King of
England, the great Henry, wishes,
then, to marry Anne Boleyn!
Why, if contemplating such a marriage
as that, did you send me to
seek the alliance of France, and to
offer the hand of your daughter in
marriage to the Duke of Orleans?
And why did you instruct me to
declare to Francis I. that your desire
was to place on the throne of
England a princess of his blood?
It was only by these representations
and promises that I succeeded in
inducing him to sign the treaty
which deprived Catherine of all assistance.
You have assured me of
your entire approval of these negotiations.
This alliance with France
was the only means by which to
secure for yourself any real defence
against the Pope and the Emperor.
Do you suppose that Charles V.
will quietly permit you to deprive
his aunt of her position and title
as queen of England?” Here Wolsey
paused, wholly transported with
indignation.</p>

<p>“Charles!” replied the king,
“Charles? I can easily manage
and pacify him by fine promises
and long negotiations. As to our
Holy Father, I will stir up strife
enough to fill his hands so full that
he will not be able to attend to anything
else. The quarrels of Austria
and France always end by recoiling
on his head, and I imagine
he will not soon forget the sacking
Rome and his former imprisonment.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you forget,” said Wolsey,
“that the King of France will
accuse you of flagrant bad faith:
and will you bring on yourself their
abhorrence in order to espouse
Anne Boleyn?”</p>

<p>The minister pronounced these
last words with an expression and
in a tone of such contemptuous
scorn as to arouse in a fearful degree
the indignation of the king,
accustomed only to the flattery and
servile adulation of his courtiers.
At the same time, he was compelled
to feel the force of the cardinal’s
reasoning, although the truth only
served still more to irritate and
enrage him.</p>

<p>“Cease, Wolsey!” cried Henry,
fixing his flashing eyes fiercely upon
him; “I am not here to listen
to your complaints. I shall marry
whom I please; and your head
shall answer for the fidelity with
which you assist me in executing
my will.”</p>

<p>“My head, sire,” replied Wolsey
courageously, “has long belonged
to you; my entire life has been devoted
to your service; and yet I
shall most probably, in the end,
have bitter cause to repent having
always made myself subservient to
your wishes. But your majesty
will surely reflect more seriously on
the dishonor you will necessarily
incur by such a choice as this.
The queen’s party will grow stronger
and stronger, and I tell you
frankly, I fear lest the legate be inflexible.”</p>

<p>“Wolsey,” cried Henry, elevating
his voice in a threatening manner,
“I have already declared my
intentions&mdash;is that not sufficient?
As to the legate, I repeat, he must be
gained over to my cause. Gold and
flattery will soon secure to us that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
tender conscience whose scruples
you now so sorely apprehend.
Bring him to me to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“He is suffering too much, sire.
The cardinal is aged and very infirm;
I have no idea he will be in a
condition to see your majesty for
several days yet.”</p>

<p>“Too long, entirely too long to
wait!” replied the king. “I must
see him this very day; he shall be
compelled to make his appearance.
I wish you to be present also, as
we shall discuss affairs of importance,
and then I shall depart.”</p>

<p>With these words Henry withdrew
and went to look for a casket,
of which he alone carried the key,
and in which he usually kept his
most valuable and important papers.</p>

<p>During his absence, Wolsey remained
leaning on the table, before
which he was seated, absorbed in
deep and painful reflections. He
feared Henry too much to oppose
him long in any of his designs; besides,
he saw no possible means
to induce him to change his resolution.
He had felt, as we have
seen, a momentary compassion for
the misfortunes of the queen, but
that impression had been speedily
effaced by considerations of far
greater moment to himself.</p>

<p>As a shrewd diplomatist, he regretted
the alliance with France;
besides, he was really too much interested
in the welfare of the king
not to deplore his determination to
contract such a marriage.</p>

<p>But the cause of his deepest
anxiety was the knowledge he possessed
of Anne’s great dislike for
him, and the consciousness that her
family and counsellors were his rivals
and enemies; in consequence
of which he clearly foresaw they
would induce her to use all the influence
she possessed with the
king in order to deprive him of
Henry’s favor and patronage. He
was suffering this mental conflict
when the king reappeared, bearing
a bronze casket carved with rare
perfection. Placing it on the table,
he unlocked it. Among a great
many papers which it contained
was a very handsome book, the
printing beautifully executed, and
every page ornamented with arabesques
exquisitely tinted and shaded.
The cover, formed of two
metal plates, represented in bass-relief
the figures of Faith, Hope,
and Charity as young virgins, bearing
in their hands and on their foreheads
the allegorical emblems of
those sublime Christian virtues.
Emeralds of immense value, surrounded
by heavy gold settings,
adorned the massive gold clasps,
and also served to hold them firmly
in their places.</p>

<p>On the back of this book, deeply
engraven in the metal, were the
following words: <cite>The Seven Sacraments</cite>.
Henry had written this work
in defence of the ancient dogmas of
the Catholic Church, when first attacked
by the violent doctrines of
a monk named Luther. Whether
the king had really composed it
himself, or whether he had caused
it to be secretly done by another,
and wished to enjoy the reputation
of being the author, he certainly attached
great importance to the
work. Not only had he distributed
it throughout his own kingdom, but
had sent it to the Pope and to all
the German princes, through the
Dean of Windsor, whom he instructed
to say that he was ready to defend
the faith, not only with his
pen but, if need be, with his sword
also. It was at that time that he
asked and obtained from the court
of Rome the title of “Defender of
the Faith.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Now he was constantly busy
with a manuscript, which he took
from the mysterious casket, containing
a Treatise on Divorce, and to
which he every day devoted several
hours. Greatly pleased with a number
of arguments he had just found,
he came to communicate them to
Wolsey. The latter, after urging
several objections, at length reminded
him of the fraudulent and persistent
means that had been employed
to extract from the University
of Oxford an opinion favorable
to divorce. “And yet,” added the
cardinal, “it has been found impossible
to prevent them from increasing
the number of most important
restrictions, and thus rendering
your case exceedingly difficult,
if not entirely hopeless.”</p>

<p>“What!” said the king, “after
the good example of the University
of Cambridge, are we still to encounter
scruples? Consider it
well, cardinal, in order not to forget
the recompense, and, above all,
the punishment, for that is the
true secret of success! You will
also take care to write to the
Elector Frederick, and say that
I wait to receive the humble apologies
of that man Luther, whom he
has taken so entirely under his protection.”</p>

<p>“Sire,” replied the cardinal, “I
have received frequent intelligence
with regard to that matter
which I have scarcely dared communicate
to you.”</p>

<p>“And why not?” demanded the
king. “Do you presume, my lord
cardinal, that the abuse of an obscure
and turbulent monk can affect
me? And besides, to tell you
the truth, I do not know but
this man may, after all, be useful to
me. He has attracted the attention
of the court of Rome, and may yet
have to crave my protection.”</p>

<p>“Well, sire, since you compel me
to speak, I will tell you that, far
from making humble apologies, his
violence against you has redoubled.
I have just received a tract he has recently
published. In it I find many
passages where, in speaking of you,
he employs the most abusive epithets
and expressions. For instance,
he repeatedly declares that
your majesty ‘is a fool, an ass, and
a madman,’ that you are ‘coarser
than a hog, and more stupid than a
jackass.’ He speaks with equal
scurrility of our Holy Father the
Pope, addressing him, in terms of
the most unparalleled effrontery,
this pretended warning, which is
of course intended simply as an insult:
‘My petit Paul, my petit
Pope, my young ass, walk carefully&mdash;it
is very slippery&mdash;you may fall
and break your legs. You will
surely hurt yourself, and then people
will say, “What the devil does
this mean? The petit Pope has hurt
himself.”’ Further on, I find this
ridiculous comparison, which could
only emanate from a vile and shameless
pen: ‘The ass knows that he
is an ass, the stone knows that it is
a stone, but these asses of popes
are unable to recognize themselves
as asses.’ He concludes at length
with these words, which fill the
measure of his impiety and degradation:
‘If I were ruler of an empire,
I would make a bundle of the
Pope and his cardinals, and throw
them altogether into that little
pond, the Tuscan Sea. I pledge
my word that such a bath would
restore their health, and I pledge
Jesus Christ as my security!’”</p>

<p>“What fearful blasphemy!” cried
Henry. “Could a Christian possibly
be supposed to utter such absurd,
blasphemous vulgarities? I
trow not! This pretended ‘reformer’
of the ‘discipline and abuses of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the church’ seems to possess any
other than an evangelical character.
No one can doubt his divine
mission and his Christian charity!
A man who employs arguments
like these is too vile and too contemptible
to be again mentioned in
my presence. Let me hear no more
of this intolerable apostate! Proceed
now with business.”</p>

<p>“Sire,” then continued the cardinal,
presenting a list to the king,
“here are the names of several
candidates I wish you to consider
for the purpose of appointing
a treasurer of the exchequer.
Thomas More has already filled,
most honorably, a number of offices
of public trust, and is also a
man of equal ability and integrity.
I recommend him to your majesty
for this office.”</p>

<p>“I approve your selection most
unhesitatingly,” replied the king.
“I am extremely fond of More,
and perfectly satisfied with the
manner in which he has performed
his official duties heretofore. You
will so inform him from me. What
next?”</p>

<p>“I would also petition your majesty
that Cromwell be confirmed
as intendant-general of the monasteries
latterly transformed into colleges.”</p>

<p>“Who is this Cromwell?” inquired
Henry. “I have no recollection
of him.”</p>

<p>“Sire,” replied Wolsey, “he is
of obscure birth, the son of a fuller
of this city. He served in the
Italian wars in his youth; afterwards
he applied himself to the
study of law. His energies and
abilities are such as to entitle him
to the favorable consideration of
your majesty.”</p>

<p>“Let him be confirmed as you
desire,” replied the king very graciously,
as he proceeded to sign the
different commissions intended for
the newly appointed officials.</p>

<p>“I wish,” he added, regarding
Wolsey with a keen, searching
glance, “that you would find some
position for a young ecclesiastic
called Cranmer, who has been
strongly recommended to me for
office.”</p>

<p>The brow of the cardinal contracted
into a heavy frown as he
heard the name of a man but too
well known to him. He immediately
divined that it was from Anne
Boleyn alone the king had received
this recommendation.</p>

<p class="break">In the meantime, the queen had
been carried to her apartments.
The devoted efforts of the ladies
of her household, who surrounded
her with the tenderest ministrations,
soon recalled her to the consciousness
and full realization of
her misery.</p>

<p>Now the night has come, and
found Catherine still seated before
the grate, absorbed in deep
thought. Born under the soft
skies of Spain, she had never become
acclimated, nor accustomed
to the humid, foggy atmosphere of
England. Like a delicate plant
torn from its native soil, she sighed
unceasingly for the balmy air and
the golden sunlight of her own
genial southern clime. Such regrets,
added to the sorrows she had experienced,
had thrown her into a state
of habitual melancholy, from which
nothing could arouse her, and which
the slightest occurrence sufficed to
augment. For a long time her
firmness of character had sustained
her; but her health beginning to
fail, and no longer able to arouse the
energy and courage which had before
raised her above misfortune, she
sank beneath the burden and abandoned
herself to hopeless sorrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>As she sat all alone in her chamber,
she held in her hand a letter
but recently received from her native
country. Reading it slowly,
she mused, dreaming of the days
of her happy childhood, when suddenly
the door was opened, and a
young girl, apparently ten or twelve
years of age, ran in and threw her
arms around the neck of the
queen. The figure of the child
was slight and graceful; around
her waist was tied a broad sash of
rose-colored ribbon, with long ends
floating over her white muslin
dress; her beautiful blonde hair
was drawn back from her forehead
and fastened with bows of ribbon,
leaving exposed a lovely little face
glowing with animation and spirit,
and a frank, ingenuous expression,
at once prepossessing and charming.
This was the Princess Mary,
the daughter of Henry, the future
consort of a Spanish prince, to
whom the shrewd diplomatist Wolsey
had promised her hand, in
order to deprive the unfortunate
mother of this her only remaining
consolation.</p>

<p>“Why is it, my dearest mamma,”
she exclaimed, “that you are again
in tears?” And, laughingly, she
took the handkerchief from the
queen and put it to her own eyes,
pretending to weep.</p>

<p>“See now, this is the way I shall
do when I am grown up, for it
seems to me grown-up people are
always weeping. Oh! I wish I
could always remain a child, and
then I should never be miserable!
Listen, my dear mamma,” she continued,
again twining her arms
around her mother’s neck, “why is
it that you are always weeping and
so sad? It must surely do you
harm. Everybody is not like you,
constantly sighing and in tears, I
do assure you. Only this morning,
I was at St. James’ Park with
Alice, and there I met Lady Anne
Boleyn; she was laughing gaily as
she promenaded with a number of
her friends. I ran immediately to
her to say good morning, for I was
really very glad to see her. How
is it, mamma&mdash;I thought you told
me she had gone to Kent to visit
her father?”</p>

<p>“My child,” replied the queen,
her tears flowing afresh, “what I
told you was true; but she has
since returned without my being informed.”</p>

<p>“But, mamma, since this is your
own house, why has she not yet presented
herself? I am very sorry she
has acted so, for I love her better
than any of the other ladies. She
told me all she saw in France when
she travelled with my aunt, the
Duchess of Suffolk. Oh! how I
would love to see France. Lady
Anne says it is a most beautiful
country. She has described to me
all the magnificent entertainments
that King Louis XII. gave in honor
of my aunt. Mamma, when I
marry, I want the King of France
to be my husband.”</p>

<p>“And you&mdash;you also love Anne
Boleyn?” replied the queen.</p>

<p>“Oh! yes, mamma, <em>very</em> much,
very much indeed!” innocently answered
the child. “I am very sorry
she is no longer to be here, she is
so amiable, and when she plays
with me she always amuses me so
much!”</p>

<p>“Well, my dear child,” replied
the queen, “I will tell you now why
people weep when they are grown
up, as you say: it is because they
very often love persons who no
longer return their affection.”</p>

<p>“And do you believe she no
longer loves me?” replied the impulsive
little Mary with a thoughtful
expression. “And yet, mamma,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
I kissed her this morning and embraced
her with all my heart.
However, I now remember that she
scarcely spoke a word to me; but
I had not thought of it before.
She seemed to be very much embarrassed.
But why should she no
longer love me when I still love her
so dearly?”</p>

<p>As Mary uttered these words, a
woman entered the room and, whispering
a moment in the ear of the
queen, placed a note in her hand.</p>

<p>Catherine arose and approached
the light; after reading the note,
she called the young princess and
requested her to retire to her chamber,
as she had something to write
immediately that was very important.</p>

<p>Mary ran gaily to her mother,
and, after kissing and embracing
her fondly and tenderly again and
again, she at last bade her good-night,
and with a smiling face bounded
from the room in the same light
and buoyant manner that she had
entered it.</p>

<p>“Leonora,” said the queen, “my
dear child, you have left for my
sake our beautiful Spain, and have
ever served me with faithful devotion.
Listen, now, to the request I
shall make&mdash;go bring me immediately
the dress and outer apparel
belonging to one of the servant
women.”</p>

<p>“Why so, my lady?”</p>

<p>“Ask no questions&mdash;I have use
for them; you will accompany me;
I must go to London this night.”</p>

<p>“Good heaven! my dear mistress,
what are you saying?” cried
Leonora in great alarm. “Go to
London to-night? It is five miles;
you will never be able to walk it,
and you well know it would be impossible
to attempt the journey in
any other way&mdash;they would detect
us.”</p>

<p>“Leonora,” answered the queen,
“I am resolved to go. Faithful
friends inform me that the legate
has arrived. Henry will now redouble
his vigilance. I have but
one day&mdash;if I lose this opportunity,
I shall never succeed. My last remaining
hope rests upon this. If
you refuse to accompany me, I shall
go alone.”</p>

<p>“Alone!&mdash;oh! my beloved mistress,”
cried Leonora, her hands
clasped and her eyes streaming
tears, “you can never do this!
Think of what you are going to
undertake! If you were recognized,
the king would be at once
informed, and we would both be
lost.”</p>

<p>“Even so, Leonora; but what
have I to lose? Is it possible for
me to be made more wretched?
Shall I abandon this, my last hope?
No, no, Leonora; I am accountable
to my children for the honor of
their birth. Go now, my good girl!
fly&mdash;there is not a moment to lose.
Fear nothing; God will protect us!”</p>

<p>Leonora, shrewd and adroit like the
women of her country, was very soon
in possession of the desired habiliments.
Her actions might have
excited suspicion, perhaps; but entirely
devoted to the queen as she
was she felt no fear, and would,
without hesitation, have exposed
herself to even greater danger, had
it been necessary, in the execution
of her mistress’ wishes.</p>

<p>Catherine feigned to retire; and,
after her attendants had been dismissed,
she left the palace, closely
enveloped in a long brown cloak,
such as was habitually worn by
the working-women of that period.
The faithful Leonora tremblingly
followed the footsteps of her mistress.
They breathed more freely
when they found themselves at
last beyond the limits of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
castle. Leonora, however, when
they entered the road leading
to London, anxiously reflected on
the danger of meeting some one who
would probably recognize them.
Her excited imagination even began
to conjure up vague apprehensions
of the dead, to blend with
her fears of the living. She also
dreaded lest the strength of the
queen should prove unequal to the
journey&mdash;in fine, she feared everything.
The sighing winds, the rustling
leaves, the sound of her own
footsteps as she walked over the
stones, startled and filled her with
apprehension. Very soon there was
another cause for alarm. The wind
suddenly arose with violence; dark
clouds overspread the heavens; the
moon disappeared; large drops of
rain began to fall, and soon poured
in torrents, deluging the earth
and drenching their garments.</p>

<p>In vain they increased their
speed; the storm raged with such
fury they were compelled to take
refuge under a tree by the roadside.</p>

<p>“My poor Leonora,” said the
queen, supporting herself against
the trunk of the tree, whose wide-spread
branches were being lashed
and bent by the fury of the storm,
“I regret now having brought you
with me. I am already sufficiently
miserable without the additional
pain of seeing my burdens laid
upon others.”</p>

<p>“My beloved lady and mistress,”
cried Leonora, “I am not half so
unhappy at this moment as I was
when I feared my brothers would
prevent me from following you to
England. It seems to me I can
see the vessel now, with its white
sails unfurled, bearing you away,
whilst I, standing on the shore, with
frantic cries, entreated them to let
me rejoin you. That night, I remember,
being unable to sleep, I
went down into the orange-grove,
the perfume of whose fruits and
flowers embalmed the air of the
palace gardens. Wiping away the
sad tears, I fixed my eyes upon
your windows, which the light of
our beautiful skies rendered distinctly
visible even at night. In
Spain, at that hour, we can walk
by the light of the stars; but in
this land of mud and water, this
horrid England, one has to be wrapped
to the ears in furs all the year
round, or shiver with cold from
morning till night. This is doubtless
the reason why the English are
so dull and so tiresome to others.
In what a condition is this light
mantle that covers our heads!” said
Leonora, shaking the coarse woollen
cloak dripping with water, that enveloped
Catherine. “These Englishwomen,”
she resumed, “know
no more about the sound of a
guitar than they do about the
rays of the sun; they are all just
as melancholy as moles. There is
not one of them, except the Princess
Mary, who seems to have the
slightest idea of our beautiful
Spain.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” sighed the queen, “she is
just as I was at her age. God forbid
that her future should resemble
that of her mother!”</p>

<p>In the meantime the storm had
gradually abated; time pressed,
and Catherine again resumed her
journey with renewed courage and
accelerated speed. In spite of the
mud, in which she sank at every
step, she redoubled her efforts.
For what cannot the strong human
will accomplish, when opposed to
feeble, physical strength alone, or
even when the obstacles interposed
proceed from the elements themselves?
She at length arrived at
the gate of the palace of Lambeth,
situated on the banks of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Thames, where the cardinal Campeggio,
according to the intelligence
conveyed to her, would hold
his court.</p>

<p>The courtyards, the doors, the
ante-chambers, were thronged with
servants and attendants, eager and
active in the performance of their
duties, for Henry had ordered that
the cardinal should be entertained
in a style of princely munificence,
and entirely free from personal expense.
All these valets, being
strangers to their new masters, and
unaccustomed to their new employments,
permitted the queen to pass
without question or detention, not,
however, without a stare of stupid
curiosity at her muddy boots and
draggled garments.</p>

<p>Catherine, being perfectly familiar
with the interior of the palace,
had no difficulty in finding the
legate’s cabinet.</p>

<p>The venerable prelate was slightly
lame, and in a feeble and precarious
state of health. She found
him seated before the fire in a
large velvet arm-chair, engaged in
reading his Breviary. His face was
pale and emaciated; a few thin
locks of snow-white hair hung
about his temples. Hearing the
door open, he rested the book on
his knee, casting upon the queen,
as she entered, a keen, penetrating
glance.</p>

<p>Without hesitation, Catherine advanced
towards him. “My lord
cardinal,” she exclaimed, removing
the hood from her face, “you see
before you the queen of England,
the legitimate spouse of Henry
VIII.”</p>

<p>Hearing these words, Campeggio
was unable to suppress an exclamation
of surprise. He arose
at once to his feet, and, perceiving
the extraordinary costume in which
Catherine was arrayed, he cast upon
her a look of incredulous astonishment.
He was about to speak
when she, with great vehemence,
interrupted him.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she cried, raising her
hands towards heaven, “I call upon
God to witness the truth of what I
say&mdash;I am Queen Catherine! You
are astonished to see me here at
this hour, and in this disguise.
Know, then, that I am a prisoner in
my own palace; my cruel husband
would have prevented me from coming
to you. They tell me you are
sent to sit in judgment on my case.
Surely, then, you should be made acquainted
with my bitter woes and
grievances. Lend not your aid to
the cause of injustice and wrong,
but be the strength of the weak,
the defence of the innocent. A
stranger in this country, I have no
friends; fear of the king drives
them all from me. I cannot doubt it&mdash;no,
you will not refuse to hear my
appeal. You will defend the cause
of an injured mother and her
helpless children. What! would
you be willing to condemn me
without first hearing my cause&mdash;I,
the daughter of kings? Have I been
induced to marry Henry of Lancaster
to enjoy the honors of royalty,
when all such honors belong
to me by my birthright? Catherine
of Aragon has never been
unfaithful to her husband; but to-day,
misled by a criminal passion,
he wishes to place upon the throne
of England a shameless woman, to
deny his own blood, and brand his
own children with the stigma of
illegitimacy! Yes, I solemnly
declare to you that nothing can
shake my resolution or divert me
from my purpose! Strong in my
innocence and in the justice of my
cause, I will appeal to the whole
world&mdash;aye, even to God himself!”</p>

<p>The cardinal stood motionless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
regarding Catherine with reverence,
as an expression of haughty indignation
lighted up her noble features.
He was struck with admiration
at her courage and filled with
compassion for her woes.</p>

<p>“No, madam,” he replied, “I am
not to be your judge. I know that
it is but too true that you are surrounded
by enemies. But let me
assure you that in me, at least, you
will not find another. I shall esteem
myself most happy if, by my
counsel or influence, I may be of
service to your cause, and it is from
the depths of my heart that I beg
you to rely upon this assurance.”</p>

<p>Catherine would have thanked
him, but a noise was that moment
heard of the ushers throwing the
doors violently open and announcing,
in a loud voice, “His Eminence
Cardinal Wolsey!”</p>

<p>“Merciful heaven!” cried Catherine,
“must this odious man pursue
me for ever?” She hurriedly
lowered her veil, and took her place
at the left of the door, and the moment
he entered passed out behind
him. Wolsey glanced at her sharply,
the appearance of a woman arousing
instantly a suspicion in his mind,
but, being compelled to respond
with politeness to the legate’s salutations,
he had no time to scrutinize,
and Catherine escaped without
being recognized.</p>

<p>Wolsey was passionately fond of
pomp and pageant. The principal
positions in his house were filled
by barons and chevaliers. Among
these attendants were numbered the
sons of some of the most distinguished
families, who, under his
protection and by the aid of his
all-powerful patronage and influence,
aspired to civil or military
preferment.</p>

<p>On this occasion, he considered
it necessary to make an unusual
display of luxurious magnificence.
It was with great difficulty and
trepidation that the queen threaded
her way through the crowd of prelates,
noblemen, and young gentlemen
who awaited in the ante-chambers
the honor of being presented
by the king’s favorite to the
cardinal-legate.</p>

<p>The courtyard was filled with
their brilliant equipages, conspicuous
among which were observed a
great number of mules, richly caparisoned,
and carrying on their
backs immense chests, covered with
crimson cloth, trimmed with fringe
and embroidered with gold.</p>

<p>A crowd of idle valets were engaged
in conversation at the foot
of the stairs. The queen, in passing
them, attracted their attention, exciting
their ridicule and coarse
gibes, and she heard them also indulge
in the most insolent conjectures
regarding her.</p>

<p>“Who is that woman?” said one.
“See how dirty she is.” “She
looks like a beggar, indeed,” cried
another, addressing himself to one
of the new-comers engaged to attend
the legate. “Your master
receives strange visitors; we, on
the contrary, have nothing to do
with people like that, except quickly
to show them the door.”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! you will have your
hands full,” exclaimed the most insolent
of the crowd, “if your master
gives audience to such rabble as
that.” Emboldened by these remarks,
one of the porters approached
the queen, and, rudely
pushing her, exclaimed with an
oath: “Well, beldame, what
brought you here? Take yourself
off quickly. My lord is rich,
but his crowns were not made for
such as you.” These words excited
the loudest applause from the
whole crowd, who clapped their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
hands and cheered vociferously.
Catherine trembled with mortification.</p>

<p>“It is thus,” she mentally exclaimed,
“that the poor are received
in the palaces of the rich.
And I myself have probably more
than once, without knowing it, permitted
them to sigh in vain at the
gates of my own palace&mdash;mothers
weeping for their children, or men,
old and helpless, making a last appeal
for assistance.”</p>

<p>The queen, entirely absorbed in
these reflections, together with the
impression made upon her by the
appearance of the venerable legate,
the sudden apparition of Wolsey,
the snares that had been laid for
her, and the temptations with which
they had surrounded her, mechanically
followed Leonora, to whom
the fear that her mistress might be
pursued and arrested seemed to
have given wings.</p>

<p>“Leonora,” at length cried the
queen, “I feel that I can go no farther.
Stop, and let us rest for a
moment; you walk too quickly.”
Exhausted with fatigue, she seated
herself on a rock by the roadside.</p>

<p>She had scarcely rested a moment
when a magnificent carriage
passed. The silken curtains were
drawn back, and the flaming
torches, carried by couriers, who
surrounded the carriage, completely
illuminated the interior. Seated in
this princely equipage was a young
girl, brilliant in her youthful beauty
and the splendor of her elegant
dress and jewelled adornings. At
a glance, Catherine recognized
Anne Boleyn, who was returning
from a grand entertainment given
her by the Lord Mayor of London.</p>

<p>She passed like the light; the carriage
rapidly whirling through the
mud and water, that flew from the
wheels and covered anew the already
soiled garments of the hapless
queen.</p>

<p>Catherine, completely overcome
by painful emotions, felt as though
she were dying.</p>

<p>“Leonora, listen!” she said in a
faint voice, scarcely audible&mdash;“Leonora,
come near me&mdash;give me your
hand; I feel that I am dying! You
will carry to my daughter my last
benediction!”</p>

<p>She sought in the darkness the
hand of Leonora; the film of death
seemed gathering over her eyes;
she did not speak, her head sank
on her shoulder, and poor Leonora
thought the queen had ceased to
breathe. She at first held her in
her arms; but at length, overcome
by fatigue, she sank upon the earth
as she vainly endeavored to revive
her by breathing into her mouth
her own life-breath. But seeing all
her efforts to restore animation useless,
she came to the terrible conclusion
that Catherine was indeed
dead.</p>

<p>“My dear mistress,” she cried
wildly, wringing her hands, “my
good mistress is dead! What will
become of me? It is my fault: I
should have prevented her from
going. Ah! how miserable I am!”
And her tears and cries redoubled.
At length she heard in the distance
the sound of approaching footsteps,
and was soon able to distinguish a
litter, borne by a number of men.
“Help!” she cried, her hopes reviving
at the sight, and very soon
they were near her&mdash;“help! come
to my assistance; my mistress is
dying!” Seeing two women, one
lying on the ground supported in
the arms of another, who appeared
half-deranged, the person who occupied
the litter commanded the
men to stop immediately, and he
quickly alighted. It was the king!
He also was going to London to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
see the legate; to prevent his
anxious haste from being known,
and commented on, he had adopted
this secret conveyance. When
she saw him, Leonora was paralyzed
with apprehension and alarm.
The king instantly recognized the
queen and the unhappy Leonora.
In a furious voice, he demanded
what she was doing there and
where she had been. But in vain
she endeavored to reply&mdash;her
tongue clove to the roof of her
mouth&mdash;she was unable to articulate
a word. Transported with
rage at her silence, and by what he
suspected, he immediately had the
queen placed in the litter, and ordering
the men to walk slowly, he
followed them on foot to the palace.</p>

<p>Catherine was carried to her own
apartment, and soon restored to
consciousness; but on opening her
eyes she looked around, vainly
hoping to behold her faithful Leonora.
She never saw her again!
She had been taken away, and the
punishment that was meted out to
her, or the fate that befel the unfortunate
girl, was for ever involved in
mystery.</p>

<p>While discord filled the royal
palace with perplexity and sorrow
a statesman, simple and peaceful,
awaited, with happiness mingled with
impatience, the arrival of a friend.
In his house, all around him seemed
possessed of redoubled activity.
The family table was more elegantly
spread, fresh flowers decorated all
the apartments, the children ran
to and fro in the very excess of
their joy and delight, until at
length, in every direction, the glad
announcement was heard, “He has
come! he has come!” The entire
family eagerly descended to the
court-yard to meet and welcome
the visitor, and Sir Thomas, with
feelings of inexpressible joy, folded
in his embrace the Bishop of
Rochester, the wise and virtuous
Fisher, whom he loved with the
purest and tenderest sentiments of
friendship.</p>

<p>“At last you are here,” he exclaimed;
“how happy I am to see
you once more!”</p>

<p>While the good bishop was ascending
the stairs, surrounded by a
troop of Sir Thomas’ youngest
children, Margaret, the eldest
daughter, came forward and saluted
him, accompanied by Lady
More, her step-mother, and young
William Roper, her affianced husband.
They all entered the drawing-room
together, and, after engaging
a short time in general conversation,
Sir Thomas bade the children
retire, that he might converse with
more freedom.</p>

<p>“My dear friend,” he exclaimed,
taking the bishop’s hand again in
his own, “I cannot express the joy
I feel at your return. I have been
so long deprived of your presence,
and I have so many things to say to
you. But my heart is too full at
this moment to permit me to express
all I feel or would say! But
why have you not answered my
letters?”</p>

<p>“Your letters!” replied the bishop.
“Why, it has been more than
a month since I received one from
you.”</p>

<p>“How can that be possible unless
they have been intercepted?”
replied More. “The king every day
becomes more and more suspicious.
If this continues, it will soon be
considered high treason for a man
to think.”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell what has become
of your letters. I only know I have
not received them, and it has caused
me a great deal of anxiety and apprehension.
But my friend, since I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
find you full of life and health, I am
quite satisfied and happy. Now, let
me hear all that has happened at
court; but let me begin by first
telling you that the king has sent
me, through Cardinal Wolsey, a
document he has written on the
subject of divorce, asking my opinion
and advice. I have answered
him with all frankness and candor,
expressing myself strongly against
his views. Certainly, there is nothing
more absurd than the idea of the
king’s wishing to repudiate, after so
many years of marriage, a princess
so virtuous and irreproachable, to
whom he can find no other objection
than that she was betrothed to
his brother, Prince Arthur. Besides,
a dispensation was obtained
on that account at the time of his
marriage, therefore it would seem
his conscience ought to be perfectly
satisfied.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, his conscience should
be entirely at rest,” replied Sir
Thomas. “And if he sincerely believes
the marriage has been void
until this time, why does he not
make the effort to have it rendered
legitimate, instead of endeavoring
to annul it entirely? It is because
he wishes to marry one of the
queen’s ladies&mdash;the young Anne
Boleyn!”</p>

<p>“Oh! horrible,” cried Fisher.
“Are you sure, my friend, of what
you say? Gracious heaven! If I
had only suspected it! But I assure
you I have had entire confidence in
him. I have, therefore, examined the
subject conscientiously and with the
greatest possible diligence before
giving him my reply. Had I suspected
any such scheme as this, I
should never have had the patience
to consider the arguments he has
presented with so much duplicity.”</p>

<p>“Well, my dear Fisher,” replied
Sir Thomas, “such is the sad truth,
and such are the ‘scruples’ that
disturb the tender conscience of
the king. To repudiate the queen
and the Princess Mary, his daughter,
is his sole aim, his only desire.
I also have received an order to
read and give my opinion on the
divorce question; but I have asked
to be excused, on the ground of my
very limited knowledge of theological
matters. Moreover, all these
debates and hypocritical petitions
for advice are entirely absurd and
unnecessary. Cardinal Campeggio,
the Pope’s legate, has already arrived
from Rome, and the queen
will appear before a court composed
of the legate and Wolsey,
together with several other cardinals.”</p>

<p>“The queen brought to trial!”
cried the Bishop of Rochester.
“The queen arraigned to hear her
honor and her rank disputed?
What a shame upon England!
Who will speak for her? I would
give my life to be called to defend
her! But how is it that Wolsey&mdash;the
all-powerful Wolsey&mdash;has not
diverted the king from his unworthy
purpose?”</p>

<p>“He is said to have tried; but he
stands in awe of the king. You
know an ambitious man never opposes
him to whom he owes his
power. Nevertheless,” added More,
“I cannot believe he will dare to
pronounce the Princess Mary illegitimate.
For, all laws aside, supposing
even that the marriage were
annulled, the good faith in which it
was contracted invests her birth
with an inalienable right.”</p>

<p>“I hope it may be so,” said
Fisher; “but what immense calamities
this question will bring on our
unhappy country!”</p>

<p>“I fear so, my friend,” replied
More. “At present, the people
are pledged to the queen’s cause;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
it could not be otherwise, she is so
much beloved and esteemed; and
they declare, if the king does succeed
in repudiating Catherine, that
he will find it impossible to deprive
his daughter of her right to reign
over them.”</p>

<p>“And Wolsey,” replied the bishop
thoughtfully, “will be called to
sit in judgment on his sovereign!
He will be against her! And this
Campeggio&mdash;what says he in the
matter?”</p>

<p>“We believe,” replied More,
“that he will sustain the queen; he
seems to possess great firmness and
integrity of character. His first
interview with the king gave us
great hopes. Henry has overwhelmed
him with protestations of
his entire submission, but all his
artifices have been frustrated by
the discernment and prudence of
the Italian cardinal. His impenetrable
silence on the subject of his
own personal opinions has plunged
the king into despair. Since that
day he has honored him with incessant
visits, has offered him the
rich bishopric of Durham, and
worked unceasingly to corrupt his
integrity by promises and flattery.”</p>

<p>“How keenly the queen must
suffer,” said Fisher&mdash;“she that I
saw, at the time of her arrival in the
kingdom, so young, so beautiful,
and so idolized by Henry!”</p>

<p>“Alas! I think so,” said More.
“For some time I have found
it impossible to approach her.
However, she appears in public as
usual, always gracious and affable;
there is no change in her appearance.
The queen is truly a most
admirable woman. During your
absence, an epidemic made its
appearance called the ‘sweating
sickness,’ which made terrible ravages.
Wolsey fled from his palace,
several noblemen belonging to his
household having died very suddenly
of the disease. The king
was greatly alarmed; he never left
the queen for a moment, and united
with her in constant prayers to
God, firmly believing that her petitions
would avail to stay the pestilence.
He immediately despatched
Anne Boleyn to her father, where
she was attacked by the disease,
and truly we would have felt no
regret at her loss if the Lord in
taking her had only deigned to
show mercy to her soul. At one
time we believed the king had entirely
reformed, but, alas! the danger
had scarcely passed when he
recalled Anne Boleyn, and is again
estranged from the queen.”</p>

<p>“Death gives us terrible lessons,”
replied the Bishop of Rochester.
“In his presence we judge
of all things wisely. The illusions
of time are dissipated, to give place
to the realities of eternity!” As
the bishop said these words, several
persons who had called to see Sir
Thomas entered the room. Conspicuous
among them was Cromwell, the
protégé of Wolsey. This man was
both false and sinister, who made
use of any means that led to the acquisition
of fortune. He possessed
the arts of intrigue and flattery.
To a profound dissimulation he
added an air of politeness and a
knowledge of the world that, in
general, caused him to be well
received in society. A close
scrutiny of his character, however,
made it evident that there was
something in the depths of this
man’s soul rendering him unworthy
of any confidence. To him, vice
and virtue were words devoid of
any meaning. When he found a
man was no longer necessary to
his designs, or that he could not in
some manner use him, he made no
further effort to conciliate or retain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
his friendship. He saluted Sir
Thomas and the Bishop of Rochester
with a quiet ease, and seated himself
beside young Cranmer&mdash;“with
whom I am very well acquainted,”
he remarked. For Cromwell, like all
other intriguers, assumed intimacy
with all the world.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he uttered the
words when a Mr. Williamson was
ushered in, who had returned to
London a few days before, after a
long absence on the Continent.</p>

<p>“And so you are back, Mr. Williamson,”
cried More, taking his
hand. “You are just from Germany,
I believe? Well, do tell us
how matters stand in that country.
It seems, from what we hear,
everything is in commotion there.”</p>

<p>“Your supposition is quite correct,
sir,” replied Williamson in
a half-serious, half-jesting manner.
“The emperor is furious against
our king, and has sent ambassadors
to Rome to oppose the divorce.
But the empire is greatly disturbed
by religious dissensions, therefore I
doubt if he will be able to give the
subject as much attention as he desires.
New reformers are every
day springing up. The foremost
now is Bacer, a Dominican monk;
then comes Zwingle, the curate
of Zürich&mdash;where he endeavored
to abolish the Mass, to the great
scandal of the people&mdash;and there
is still another, named Œcolampadius,
who has joined Zwingle.
But strangest of all is that these
reformers, among themselves, agree
in nothing. The one admits a
dogma, the other rejects it; to-day
they think this, to-morrow that.
Every day some new doctrine is
promulgated. Luther has a horror
of Zwingle, and they mutually
damn each other. The devil
is no longer able to recognize
himself. They occasionally try to
patch up a reconciliation, and agree
altogether to believe a certain doctrine,
but the compact is scarcely
drawn up before the whole affair is
upset again.”</p>

<p>Cranmer, while listening to this
discourse, moved uneasily in his
chair, until at length, unable to restrain
himself longer, he interrupted
Williamson in a sharp, cutting
manner that he endeavored to
soften.</p>

<p>“In truth, sir, you speak very
slightingly of these learned and
distinguished men. And only, it
seems, because they demand a reform
in the morals of the clergy,
and preach against and denounce
the abuses of the church in the
matter of indulgences.”</p>

<p>“Beautiful reformers!” cried
Williamson. “They protest to-day
against an abuse which they alone
have felt as such, and that but for
a very short time. And permit me
to insist on your observing a fact,
which it is by no means necessary
or expedient to forget, that this
quarrel originated in the displeasure
felt by Luther because it
was not to his own order, but to
that of the Dominicans, to whom
the distribution of indulgences was
entrusted.”</p>

<p>“That may be possible, sir,” interrupted
Cranmer, “but at least
you will not deny that the immorality
of the German clergy imperatively
demanded a thorough reformation.”</p>

<p>“It is quite possible, my dear
sir, that I may not be ready at once
to agree with you in your opinions.
But if the German church has become
relaxed in morals, it is the
fault of those only who before
their elevation to the holy office
had not, as they were bound to
have, the true spirit of their vocation.
But I pray you, on this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
point of morals, it will not do to
boast of the severity of these
new apostles. The disciples of
Christ left their wives, when called
to ‘go into all the world and
preach the Gospel,’ but these men
begin by taking wives. Luther
has married a young and beautiful
nun, an act that has almost
driven his followers to despair, and
scandalized and excited the ridicule
of the whole city. As to
Bucer, he is already married to his
second wife!”</p>

<p>“What!” cried the bishop,
“these men marry! Marry&mdash;in
the face of the holy church! Do
they forget the solemn vows of chastity
they have made?&mdash;for they are
all either priests or monks.”</p>

<p>“Their vows! Oh! they <em>retract</em>
their vows, they say. These
‘vows’ are what they call <em>abuses</em>;
and the priests of this so severely
reformed church will hereafter enjoy
the inestimable privilege of marrying.”</p>

<p>Whilst this conversation had been
going on, Sir Thomas kept his eyes
closely fixed on Cranmer, trying to
discover, from the expression of his
pale, meagre face, the impression
made on him by the conversation.
He was well convinced that latterly
Cranmer, although he had already
taken orders, maintained the
new doctrines with all the influence
he possessed. And the reason
why he had so thoroughly espoused
them was because of a violent
passion conceived for the daughter
of Osiander, one of the chief reformers.</p>

<p>Born of a poor and obscure
family, he had embraced the ecclesiastical
state entirely from motives
of interest and ambition, and
without the slightest vocation, his
sole aim being to advance his own
interests and fortunes by every
possible means, and he had already
succeeded in ingratiating
himself with the Earl of Wiltshire,
who, together with all the family of
Anne Boleyn, were his devoted patrons
and friends. It was by these
means that he was afterwards elevated
to the archiepiscopal see of
Canterbury, where we will find him
servilely devoting himself to the interests
of Henry VIII., and at last
dying the death of a traitor.</p>

<p>Influenced by such motives,
Cranmer warmly defended the new
doctrines, bringing forward every
available argument, and ended by
declaring he thought it infinitely
better that the priests should be allowed
to marry than be exposed
to commit sin.</p>

<p>“Nothing obliges them to commit
sin,” cried the Bishop of Rochester,
who was no longer able to maintain
silence. “On the contrary,
sir, every law and regulation of
the discipline and canons of the
church tends to inspire and promote
the most immaculate purity
of morals. These rules may seem
hard to those who have embraced
the ecclesiastical state from motives
of pride and an ambitious self-interest,
and without having received
from God the graces necessary for
the performance of the duties of so
exalted and holy a ministry. This
is why we so often have to grieve
over the misconduct of so many of
the clergy. But if they complain
of their condition now, what will
it be when they have wives and
families to increase their cares and
add to their responsibilities? The
priest!” continued the bishop,
seeming to penetrate the very
depths of Cranmer’s narrow, contracted
soul, “have you ever reflected
upon the sublimity of his
vocation? The priest is the father
of the orphan, the brother of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
poor, the consoler of the dying, the
spiritual support of the criminal on
the scaffold, the merciful judge of
the assassin in his dungeon. Say,
do you not think the entire human
race a family sufficiently large, its
duties sufficiently extended, its responsibilities,
wants, and cares sufficiently
arduous and pressing?
How could a priest do more, when
his duty now requires him to devote,
and give himself entirely to,
each and every one of the human
family? No; a priest is a man who
has made a solemn vow to become
an angel. If he does not intend to
fulfil that vow, then let him never
pronounce it!”</p>

<p>“O Rochester!” cried Sir Thomas
More, greatly moved, “how I
delight to hear you express yourself
in this manner!”</p>

<p>And Sir Thomas spoke with all
sincerity, for the bishop, without
being conscious of it, had faithfully
described his own life and character,
and those who knew and loved
him found no difficulty in recognizing
the portrait.</p>

<p>As Sir Thomas spoke, the door
again opened, and all arose respectfully
on seeing the Duke of Norfolk
appear&mdash;that valiant captain,
to whom England was indebted for
her victory gained on the field of
Flodden. He was accompanied
by the youngest and best-beloved
of his sons, the young Henry,
Earl of Surrey. Even at his very
tender age, the artless simplicity
and graceful manners of this beautiful
child commanded the admiration
of all, while his brilliant intellect
and lively imagination announced
him as the future favorite
and cherished poet of the age.</p>

<p>Alas! how rapidly fled those
golden years of peace and happiness.
Later, and Norfolk, this
proud father, so happy in being the
parent of such a son, lived to behold
the head of that noble boy
fall upon the scaffold! The crime
of which Henry VIII. will accuse
him will be that of having united
his arms with those of Edward the
Confessor, whose royal blood mingled
with that which flowed in his
own veins.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas approached the duke
and saluted him with great deference.
The Bishop of Rochester
insisted on resigning him his chair,
but the duke declined, and seated
himself in the midst of the company.</p>

<p>“I was not aware,” said he, turning
graciously towards the bishop,
“that Sir Thomas was enjoying
such good company. I congratulate
myself on the return of my
Lord of Rochester. He will listen,
I am sure, with lively interest to
the recital I have come to make;
for I must inform you, gentlemen, I
am just from Blackfriars, where the
king summoned me this morning
in great haste, to assist, with some
of the highest dignitaries of the
kingdom, at the examination of the
queen before the assembly of cardinals.”</p>

<p>He had scarcely uttered these
words when an expression of profound
amazement overspread the
features of all present. More was
by no means the least affected.</p>

<p>“The queen!” he cried. “Has
she then appeared in person? And
so unexpectedly and rudely summoned!
They have done this in
order that she might not be prepared
with her defence!”</p>

<p>“I know not,” replied the duke;
“but I shall never be able to forget
the sad and imposing scene. When
we entered, the cardinals and the
two legates were seated on a platform
covered with purple cloth;
the king seated at their right. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
were arranged behind his chair in
perfect silence. Very soon the
queen entered, dressed in the deepest
mourning. She took her seat
on the left of the platform, facing
the king. When the king’s name
was called he arose, and remained
standing and in silence. But when
the queen was in her turn summoned,
she arose, and replied, with
great dignity, that she boldly protested
against her judges for three
important reasons: first, because
she was a stranger; secondly, because
they were all in possession of
royal benefices, which had been bestowed
on them by her adversary;
and, thirdly, that she had grave and
all-important reasons for believing
that she would not obtain justice
from a tribunal so constituted. She
added that she had already appealed
to the Pope, and would not
submit to the judgment of this
court. Having said these words,
she stood in silence, but when she
heard them declare her appeal
should not be submitted to the
Pope, she passed before the cardinals,
and, walking proudly across
the entire hall, she threw herself at
the feet of the king.</p>

<p>“It would be impossible,” continued
Norfolk, “to describe the
emotion excited by this movement.</p>

<p>“‘Sire,’ she cried, with a respectful
but firm and decided tone,
‘I beg you to regard me with compassion.
Pity me as a woman, as
a stranger without friends on whom
I can rely, without a single disinterested
adviser to whom I can turn
for counsel! I call upon God to
witness,’ she continued, raising her
expressive eyes towards heaven,
‘that I have always been to you a
loyal, faithful wife, and have made
it my constant duty to conform in
all things to your will; that I
have loved those whom you have
loved, whether I knew them to be
my enemies or my friends. For
many years I have been your wife;
I am the mother of your children.
God knows, when I married you,
I was an unsullied virgin, and since
that time I have never brought reproach
on the sanctity of my marriage
vows. Your own conscience
bears witness to the truth of what I
say. If you can find a single fault
with which to reproach me, then
will I pledge you my word to bow
my head in shame, and at once
leave your presence; but, if not, I
pray you in God’s holy name to
render me justice.’</p>

<p>“While she was speaking, a low
murmur of approbation was heard
throughout the assembly, followed
by a long, unbroken silence. The
king grew deadly pale, but made no
reply to the queen, who arose, and
was leaving the hall, when Henry
made a signal to the Duke of Suffolk
to detain her. He followed
her, and made every effort to induce
her to return, but in vain.
Turning haughtily round, she said,
in a tone sufficiently distinct to be
heard by the entire assembly:</p>

<p>“‘Go, tell the king, your master,
that until this hour I have never
disobeyed him, and that I regret
being compelled to do so now.’</p>

<p>“Saying these words, she immediately
turned and left the hall,
followed by her ladies in waiting.</p>

<p>“Her refusal to remain longer in
the presence of her judges, and the
touching, unstudied eloquence of
the appeal she had made, cast the
tribunal into a state of great embarrassment,
and the honorable
judges seemed to wish most heartily
they had some one else to decide
for them; when suddenly the
king arose, and, turning haughtily
towards them, spoke:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Sirs,’ he said, ‘most cheerfully
and with perfect confidence do I
present my testimony, bearing witness
to the spotless virtue and unsullied
integrity of the queen. Her
character, her conduct, in every
particular, has been above reproach.
But it is impossible for
me to live in the state of constant
anxiety this union causes me to
suffer. My conscience keeps me
in continual dread because of having
married this woman, who was
the betrothed wife of my own brother.
I will use no dissimulation,
my lords; I know very well that
many of you believe I have been
persuaded by the Cardinal of York
to make this appeal for a divorce.
But I declare in your presence this
day, this is an entirely false impression,
and that, on the contrary,
the cardinal has earnestly contended
against the scruples which have
disturbed my soul. But, I declare,
against my own will, and in spite of
all my regrets, his opinions have not
been able to restore to me the tranquillity
of a heart without reproach.
I have, in consequence, found it
necessary to confer again with the
Bishop of Tarbes, who has, unhappily,
only confirmed the fears I already
entertain. I have consulted
my confessor and many other prelates,
who have all advised me to
submit this question to the tribunal
of our Holy Father, the Sovereign
Pontiff. To this end, my lords, you
have been invested by him with his
own supreme authority and spiritual
power. I will listen to you as I
would listen to him&mdash;that is to say,
with the most entire submission.
I wish, however, to remind you again
that my duty towards my subjects
requires me to prevent whatever
might have the effect in the future
of disturbing their tranquillity; and,
unfortunately, I have but too strong
reasons for fearing that, at some
future day, the legitimacy of the
right of the Princess Mary to the
throne may be disputed. It is with
entire confidence that I await your
solution of a question so important
to the happiness of my subjects and
the peace of my kingdom. I have
no doubt that you will be able
to remove all the obstacles placed
in my way.’</p>

<p>“Saying these words, the king retired,
and started instantly for his
palace at Greenwich. The noblemen
generally followed him, but I
remained to witness the end of what
proved to be a tumultuous and
stormy debate. Nevertheless, after
a long discussion, they decided to
go on with the investigation, to
hear the advocates of the queen,
and continue the proceedings in
spite of her protest.”</p>

<p>“Who is the queen’s advocate?”
demanded the Bishop of Rochester.</p>

<p>“He has not yet been appointed,”
replied Norfolk. “It seems to me
it would only be just to let the
queen select her own counsel.”</p>

<p>“But she will refuse, without a
doubt,” replied Cromwell, “after
the manner she has adopted to defend
herself.”</p>

<p>They continued to converse for
a long time on this subject, which
filled with anxious apprehension
the heart of Sir Thomas, as well as
that of his faithful friend, the good
Bishop of Rochester.</p>

<h3>THE BIRTH-PLACE OF S. VINCENT DE PAUL</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse indent12">“I love all waste</div>
<div class="verse">And solitary places where we taste</div>
<div class="verse">The pleasure of believing what we see</div>
<div class="verse">Is boundless as we wish our souls to be:</div>

</div>

<div class="verse right">&mdash;<cite>Shelley.</cite></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Landes&mdash;that long, desolate
tract on the western coast of France
between the Gironde and the
Adour, with its vast forests of melancholy
pines, its lone moors and
solitary deserts, its broad marshes,
and its dunes of sand that creep
relentlessly on as if they had life&mdash;appeal
wonderfully to the imagination,
that <i lang="fr">folle du logis</i>, as Montaigne
calls it, but which, in spite
of him, we love to feed. One may
travel for hours through these vast
steppes covered with heather without
discovering the smoke of a single
chimney, or anything to relieve
the monotonous horizon, unless a
long line of low sand-hills that look
like billows swayed to and fro in
the wind; or some low tree standing
out against the cloudless heavens,
perhaps half buried in the
treacherous sands; or a gaunt peasant,
the very silhouette of a man,
on his stilts, “five feet above contradiction,”
like Voltaire’s preacher,
perhaps with his knitting-work
in his hands, or a distaff under his
arm, as if fresh from the feet of Omphale,
driving his flock before him&mdash;all
birds of one feather, or sheep
of one wool; for he is clad in a
shaggy sheepskin coat, and looks as
if he needed shearing as much as
any of them. Or perhaps this
Knight of the Sable Fleece&mdash;for the
sheep of the Landes are mostly
black&mdash;is on one of the small, light
horses peculiar to the region, said
to have an infusion of Arabian
blood&mdash;thanks to the Saracen invaders&mdash;which
are well adapted to
picking their way over quaking
bogs and moving sands, but unfortunately
are fast degenerating
from lack of care in maintaining
the purity of the breed.</p>

<p>During the winter season these
extensive heaths are converted by
the prolonged rains into immense
marshes, as the impermeable <i lang="fr">alios</i>
within six inches of the surface prevents
the absorption of moisture.
The peasant is then obliged to shut
himself up with his beasts in his
low, damp cottage, with peat for his
fuel, a pine torch for his candle,
brackish water relieved by a dash
of vinegar for drink, meagre broth,
corn bread, and perhaps salt fish
for his dinner. Whole generations
are said to live under one roof in
the Landes, so thoroughly are the
people imbued with the patriarchal
spirit. Woman has her rights here&mdash;at
least in the house. The old
<i lang="fr">dauna</i> (from <i lang="la">domina</i>, perhaps) rules
the little kingdom with a high hand,
including her sons and her sons’
wives down to the remotest generation,
with undisputed sway. It is
the very paradise of mothers-in-law.
The <i lang="la">paterfamilias</i> seldom
interferes if his soup is ready at
due time and she makes both ends
meet at the end of the year, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
trifle over for a barrel of <i lang="fr">pique-pout</i>
to be indulged in on extraordinary
occasions. From La Teste to the
valley of the Gave this old house-mother
is queen of the hive, active,
thrifty, keen of eye, and sharp of
tongue. The slightest murmur is
frozen into silence beneath the arctic
ray of her Poyser-like glance.
She is a hawk by day and an owl
by night. She directs the spinning
and weaving of the wool and flax,
orders the meals, and superintends
the wardrobe of the whole colony.
The land is so poor that it is seldom
divided among the children.
The oldest heir becomes head of
the family, and they all fare better
by sharing in the general income. In
unity there is safety&mdash;and economy.</p>

<p>At every door is the clumsy machine
for breaking the flax that is
spun during the long winter evenings
for the sail-makers of Bayonne
or the weavers of Béarn, whose
linen, if not equal to that of Flanders,
is as good as that of Normandy.
Before every house is also the
huge oven where the bread is baked
for general consumption. Flocks
of geese paddle from pool to pool
in the marshes, and wild ducks
breed undisturbed in the fens. In
the villages on the borders of the
Landes you hear in the morning a
sharp whistle that might serve for
a locomotive. It is the swineherd
summoning his charge, which issue
in a gallop, two or three from each
house, to seek their food in the
moors. They all come back in the
evening, and go to their own pens
to get the bucket of bran that
awaits them. Feeding thus in the
wild, their meat acquires a peculiar
flavor. Most of these animals
go into the market. The hams of
Bayonne have always been famous.
We might say they are historic, for
Strabo speaks of them.</p>

<p>When the rainy season is at an
end, these bogs and stagnant pools
give out a deadly miasma in the
burning sun, engendering fevers,
dysentery, and the fatal pellagra.
The system is rapidly undermined,
and the peasant seldom attains to
an advanced age. He marries at
twenty and is old at forty.</p>

<p>A kind of awe comes over the
soul in traversing this region, and
yet it has a certain mysterious attraction
which draws us on and on,
as if nature had some marvellous
secret in store for us. The atmosphere
is charged with a thin vapor
that quivers in the blazing sun.
Strange insects are in the air. A
sense of the infinite, such as we
feel in the midst of the ocean,
comes over us. We grow breathless
as the air&mdash;grow silent as the
light that gilds the vast landscape
before us. One of the greatest of
the sons of the Landes&mdash;the Père
de Ravignan&mdash;says: “Solitude is
the <i lang="fr">patrie des forts</i>: silence is their
prayer.” One feels how true it is
in these boundless moors. It is
the only prayer fit for this realm
of silence, where one is brought
closer and closer to the heart of
nature, and restored, as it were, at
least in a degree, to the primeval
relation of man with his Creator.</p>

<p>Carlyle says the finest nations in
the world, the English and the
American, are all going away into
wind and tongue. We recommend a
season in the Landes, where one
becomes speedily impressed that
“silence is the eternal duty of man.”</p>

<p>We wonder such a region should
be inhabited. The <i lang="fr">daunas</i>, we
hope, never have courage enough
to raise their still voices in the open
air. We fancy wooing carried on
in true Shaksperian style:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“O Imogen! I’ll speak to thee in silence.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&mdash;“What should Cordelia do? Love and be silent.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>However this may be, the Landes
are peopled, though thinly. Here
and there at immense distances we
come to a cottage. The men are
shepherds, fishermen, or <i lang="fr">résiniers</i>,
as the turpentine-producers are
called. Pliny, Dioscorides, and
other ancient writers speak of the
inhabitants as collecting the yellow
amber thrown up by the sea, and
trafficking in beeswax, resin, and
pitch. The Phœnicians and Carthaginians
initiated them into the
mysteries of mining and forging.
The Moors taught them the value
of their cork-trees. They still keep
bees that feed on the purple bells
of the heather, and sell vast quantities
of wax for the candles used in
the churches of France&mdash;<i lang="fr">cierges</i>, as
they are called, from <i lang="fr">cire vierge</i>&mdash;virgin
wax, wrought by chaste bees,
and alone fit for the sacred altars
of Jesus and Mary.</p>

<p>Ausonius thus speaks of the pursuits
of the people:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Mercatus ne agitas leviore numismate captans,</div>
<div class="verse">Insanis quod mox pretiis gravis auctio vendat,</div>
<div class="verse">Albentisque sevi globulos et pinguia ceræ</div>
<div class="verse">Pondera, Naryciamque picem, scissamque papyrum</div>
<div class="verse">Fumantesque olidum paganica lumina tœdas.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They are devoting more and
more attention to the production
of turpentine by planting the maritime
pine which grew here in the
days of Strabo, and thereby reclaiming
the vast tracts of sand thrown
up by the sea. A priest, the Abbé
Desbiez, and his brother are said
to have first conceived the idea of
reclaiming their native deserts and
staying the progress of the quicksands
which had buried so many
places, and were moving unceasingly
on at the rate of about twenty-five
yards a year, threatening the
destruction of many more. That
was about a hundred years ago. A
few years after M. Brémontier, a
French engineer, tested the plan by
planting, as far as his means allowed,
the maritime pine, the strong,
fibrous roots of which take tenacious
hold of the slightest crevice
in the rock, and absorb the least
nutriment in the soil. But this experiment
was slow to lead to any
important result, as the <i lang="fr">pinada</i>, or
pine plantations, involve an outlay
that makes no return for years. It
was not till Louis Philippe’s time
that the work was carried on with
any great activity. Napoleon III.
also greatly extended the plantations&mdash;the
importance of which became
generally acknowledged&mdash;not
only to arrest the progress of the
sands, but to meet the want of turpentine
in the market, so long dependent
on imports.</p>

<p>In ten years the trees begin to yield
an income. Each acre then furnishes
twelve or fifteen thousand poles for
vineyards or the coalman. The prudent
owner does not tap his trees till
they are twenty-five years old. By
that time they are four feet in circumference
and yield turpentine to
the value of fifty or sixty francs a
year. Then the <i lang="fr">résinier</i> comes
with his hatchet and makes an incision
low down in the trunk, from
which the resin flows into an earthern
jar or a hollow in the ground.
These jars are emptied at due intervals,
and the incision from time
to time is widened. Later, others
are made parallel to it. These are
finally extended around the tree.
With prudence this treatment may
be continued a century; for this
species of pine is very hardy if not
exhausted. When the poor tree is
near its end, it is hacked without
any mercy and bled to death. Then
it is only fit for the sawmill, wood-pile,
or coal-pit.</p>

<p>Poor and desolate as the Landes
are, they have had their share of
great men. “Every path on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
globe may lead to the door of a
hero,” says some one. We have
spoken of La Teste. This was the
stronghold of the stout old Captals
de Buch,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> belonging to the De
Graillys, one of the historic families
of the country. No truer specimen
of the lords of the Landes could
be found than these old captals,
who, poor, proud, and adventurous,
entered the service of the English,
to whom they remained faithful as
long as that nation had a foothold
in the land. Their name and
deeds are familiar to every reader
of Froissart. The nearness of
Bordeaux, and the numerous privileges
and exemptions granted the
foresters and herdsmen of the
Landes, explain the strong attachment
of the people to the English
crown. The De Graillys endeavored
by alliances to aggrandize
their family, and finally became
loyal subjects of France under
Louis XI. They intermarried with
the Counts of Foix and Béarn, and
their vast landed possessions were
at length united with those of the
house of Albret. Where would
the latter have been without them?
And without the Albrets, where the
Bourbons?</p>

<p>And this reminds us of the Sires
of Albret, another and still more
renowned family of the Landes.</p>

<p>Near the source of the Midou,
among the pine forests of Maremsin,
you come to a village of a
thousand people called Labrit, the
ancient Leporetum, or country of
hares, whence Lebret, Labrit, and
Albret. Here rose the house of
Albret from obscurity to reign at
last over Navarre and unite the
most of ancient Aquitaine to the
crown of France. The history of
these lords of the heather is a marvel
of wit and good-luck. Great
hunters of hares and seekers of
heiresses, they were always on the
scent for advantageous alliances,
not too particular about the age
or face of the lady, provided they
won broad lands or a fat barony.
Once in their clutches, they seldom
let go. They never allowed a
daughter to succeed to any inheritance
belonging to the <i lang="fr">seigneurie</i> of
Albret as long as there was a male
descendant. Always receive, and
never give, was their motto. Their
daughters had their wealth of
beauty for a dowry, with a little
money or a troublesome fief liable
to reversion.</p>

<p>The Albrets are first heard of in
the XIth century, when the Benedictine
abbot of S. Pierre at Condom,
alarmed for the safety of
Nérac, one of the abbatial possessions,
called upon his brother,
Amanieu d’Albret, for aid. The
better to defend the monk’s property,
the Sire of Albret built a castle
on the left bank of the Baïse,
and played the <i lang="fr">rôle</i> of protector so
well that at last his descendants
are found sole lords of Nérac, on
the public square of which now
stands the statue of Henry IV., the
most glorious of the race. The
second Amanieu went to the Crusades
under the banner of Raymond
of St. Gilles, and entered
Jerusalem next to Godfrey of Bouillon,
to whom an old historian
makes him related, nobody knows
how. Oihenard says the Albrets
descended from the old kings of
Navarre, and a MS. of the XIVth
century links them with the Counts
of Bigorre; but this was probably
to flatter the pride of the house
after it rose to importance. We
find a lord of Albret in the service
of the Black Prince with a thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
lances (five thousand men),
and owner of Casteljaloux, Lavazan,
and somehow of the abbey of
Sauve-Majour; but not finding the
English service sufficiently lucrative,
he passed over to the enemy.
Charles d’Albret was so able a captain
that he quartered the lilies of
France on his shield, and held the
constable’s sword till the fatal battle
of Agincourt. Alain d’Albret
made a fine point in the game by
marrying Françoise de Bretagne,
who, though ugly, was the niece
and only heiress of Jean de Blois,
lord of Périgord and Limoges.
His son had still better luck. He
married Catherine of Navarre. If
he lost his possessions beyond the
Pyrenees, he kept the county of
Foix, and soon added the lands of
Astarac. Henry I. of Navarre, by
marrying Margaret of Valois, acquired
all the spoils of the house
of Armagnac. Thus the princely
house of Navarre, under their
daughter Jeanne, who married Antoine
de Bourbon, was owner of all
Gascony and part of Guienne. It
was Henry IV. of France who
finally realized the expression of
the blind faith of the house of Albret
in its fortune, expressed in the
prophetic device graven on the
Château de Coarraze, where he
passed his boyhood: “<i lang="es">Lo que ha de
ser no puede faltar</i>”&mdash;That which
must be will be!</p>

<p>But we have not yet come to the
door of our hero. There is another
native of the Landes whose fame
has gone out through the whole
earth&mdash;whose whole life and aim
were in utter contrast with the
spirit of these old lords of the
heather. The only armor he ever
put on was that of righteousness;
the only sword, that of the truth;
the only jewel, that which the old
rabbis say Abraham wore, the light
of which raised up the bowed down
and healed the sick, and, after his
death, was placed among the stars!
It need not be said we refer to S.
Vincent de Paul, the great initiator
of public charity in France, who
by his benevolence perhaps effected
as much for the good of the kingdom
as Richelieu with his political
genius. He was born during the
religious conflicts of the XVIth century,
in the little hamlet of Ranquine,
in the parish of Pouy, on the
border of the Landes, a few miles
from Dax. It must not be supposed
the <i lang="fr">particule</i> in his name is indicative
of nobility. In former times
people who had no name but that
given them at the baptismal font
often added the place of their birth
to prevent confusion. S. Vincent
was the son of a peasant, and spent
his childhood in watching his
father’s scanty flock among the
moors. The poor cottage in which
he was born is still standing, and
near it the gigantic old oak to the
hollow of which he used to retire
to pray, both of which are objects
of veneration to the pious pilgrim
of all ranks and all lands. Somewhere
in these vast solitudes&mdash;whether
among the ruins of Notre
Dame de Buglose, destroyed a little
before by the Huguenots, or in his
secret oratory in the oak, we cannot
say&mdash;he heard the mysterious voice
which once whispered to Joan of
Arc among the forests of Lorraine&mdash;a
voice difficult to resist, which decided
his vocation in life. He resolved
to enter the priesthood. The
Franciscans of Dax lent him books
and a cell, and gave him a pittance
for the love of God; but he finished
his studies and took his degree at
Toulouse, as was only discovered
by papers found after his death, so
unostentatious was his life. He
partly defrayed his expenses at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Toulouse by becoming the tutor of
some young noblemen of Buzet.
Near the latter place was a solitary
mountain chapel in the woods, not
far from the banks of the Tarn,
called Notre Dame de Grâce. Its
secluded position, the simplicity of
its decorations, and the devotion
he experienced in this quiet oratory,
attracted the pious student, and he
often retired there to pray before
the altar of Our Lady of Grace.
It was there he found strength to
take upon himself the yoke of the
priesthood&mdash;a yoke angels might
fear to bear. It was there, in solitude
and silence, assisted by a
priest and a clerk, that he offered
his first Mass; for, so terrified was he
by the importance and sublimity of
this divine function, he had not the
courage to celebrate it in public.
This chapel is still standing, and is
annually crowded with pilgrims on
the festival of S. Vincent of Paul.
It is good to kneel on the worn
flag-stones where the saint once
prayed, and pour out one’s soul
before the altar that witnessed the
fervor of his first Mass. The superior-general
of the Lazarists visited
this interesting chapel in 1851, accompanied
by nearly fifty Sisters
of Charity. They brought a relic
of the saint, a chalice and some
vestments for the use of the chaplain,
and a bust of S. Vincent for
the new altar to his memory.</p>

<p>Every step in S. Vincent’s life is
marked by the unmistakable hand
of divine Providence. Captured
in a voyage by Algerine pirates, he
is sold in the market-place of Tunis,
that he might learn to sympathize
with those who are in bonds;
he falls into the hands of a renegade,
who, with his whole family,
is soon converted and makes his
escape from the country. S. Vincent
presents them to the papal
legate at Avignon, and goes to
Rome, whence he returns, charged
with a confidential mission by Cardinal
d’Ossat. He afterwards becomes
a tutor in the family of the
Comte de Gondi&mdash;another providential
event. The count is governor-general
of the galleys, and
the owner of vast possessions in
Normandy. S. Vincent labors
among the convicts, and, if he cannot
release them from their bonds,
he teaches them to bear their sufferings
in a spirit of expiation. He
establishes rural missions in Normandy,
and founds the College of
Bons-Enfants and the house of S.
Lazare at Paris.</p>

<p>A holy widow, Mme. Legros, falls
under his influence, and charitable
organizations of ladies are formed,
and sisters for the special service
of the sick are established at S.
Nicolas du Chardonnet. Little
children, abandoned by unnatural
mothers, are dying of cold and hunger
in the streets; S. Vincent opens
a foundling asylum, and during the
cold winter nights he goes alone
through the most dangerous quarters
of old Paris in search of these
poor waifs of humanity.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Clerical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
instruction is needed, and Richelieu,
at his instance, endows the
first ecclesiastical seminary. The
moral condition of the army excites
the saint’s compassion, and the cardinal
authorizes missionaries among
the soldiers. The province of
Lorraine is suffering from famine.
Mothers even devour their own
children. In a short time S. Vincent
collects sixteen hundred thousand
livres for their relief. Under
the regency of Anne of Austria he
becomes a member of the Council
of Ecclesiastical Affairs. In the wars
of the Fronde he is for peace, and
negotiates between the queen and
the parliament. The foundation
of a hospital for old men marks the
end of his noble, unselfish life. The
jewel of charity never ceases to
glow in his breast. It is his great
bequest to his spiritual children.
How potent it has been is proved
by the incalculable good effected
to this day by the Lazarists, Sisters
of Charity, and Society of S. Vincent
of Paul&mdash;beautiful constellations
in the firmament of the
church!</p>

<p>In the midst of his honors S.
Vincent never forgot his humble
origin, but often referred to it with
the true spirit of <i lang="la">ama nesciri et pro
nihilo reputari</i>. Not that he was
inaccessible to human weakness, but
he knew how to resist it. We read
in his interesting <cite>Life</cite> by Abbé
Maynard that the porter of the
College of Bons-Enfants informed
the superior one day that a poorly-clad
peasant, styling himself his
nephew, was at the door. S. Vincent
blushed and ordered him to be
taken up to his room. Then he
blushed for having blushed, and,
going down into the street, embraced
his nephew and led him into the
court, where, summoning all the
professors of the college, he presented
the confused youth: “Gentlemen,
this is the most respectable
of my family.” And he continued,
during the remainder of his visit, to
introduce him to visitors of every
rank as if he were some great lord,
in order to avenge his first movement
of pride. And when, not
long after, he made a retreat, he
publicly humbled himself before his
associates: “Brethren, pray for
one who through pride wished to
take his nephew secretly to his
room because he was a peasant and
poorly dressed.”</p>

<p>S. Vincent returned only once to
his native place after he began his
apostolic career. This was at the
close of a mission among the convicts
of Bordeaux. During his visit
he solemnly renewed his baptismal
vows in the village church where
he had been baptized and made his
First Communion, and on the day
of his departure he went with bare
feet on a pilgrimage to Notre
Dame de Buglose, among whose
ruins he had so often prayed in his
childhood, but which was now rebuilt.
He was accompanied, not
only by his relatives, but by all the
villagers, who were justly proud of
their countryman. He sang a solemn
Mass at the altar of Our
Lady, and afterwards assembled
the whole family around the table
for a modest repast, at the end of
which he rose to take leave of
them. They all fell at his feet and
implored his blessing. “Yes, I
give you my blessing,” replied he,
much affected, “but I bless you
poor and humble, and beg our
Lord to continue among you the
grace of holy poverty. Never
abandon the condition in which
you were born. This is my earnest
recommendation, which I beg
you to transmit as a heritage to
your children. Farewell for ever!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>His advice was religiously kept.
By mutual assistance his family
might have risen above its original
obscurity. Some of his mother’s
family were advocates at the parliament
of Bordeaux, and it would
have been easy to obtain offices
that would have given them, at
least, prominence in their own village;
but they clung to their rural
pursuits. The advice of their
sainted relative was too precious a
legacy to be renounced.</p>

<p>Not that S. Vincent was insensible
to their condition or unambitious
by nature, but he knew the
value of the hidden life and the
perils of worldly ambition. We
have on this occasion another
glimpse of his struggles with nature.
Hardly had he left his relatives
before he gave vent to his
emotion in a flood of tears, and he
almost reproached himself for leaving
them in their poverty. But let
us quote his own words: “The
day I left home I was so filled
with sorrow at separating from my
poor relatives that I wept as I
went along&mdash;wept almost incessantly.
Then came the thought of
aiding them and bettering their
condition; of giving so much to
this one, and so much to that.
While my heart thus melted within
me, I divided all I had with them.
Yes, even what I had not; and I
say this to my confusion, for God
perhaps permitted it to make me
comprehend the value of the evangelical
counsel. For three months
I felt this importunate longing to
promote the interests of my brothers
and sisters. It constantly
weighed on my poor heart. During
this time, when I felt a little relieved,
I prayed God to deliver me
from this temptation, and persevered
so long in my prayer that at
length he had pity on me and took
away this excessive tenderness for
my relations; and though they have
been needy, and still are, the good
God has given me the grace to
commit them to his Providence,
and to regard them as better off
than if they were in an easier condition.”</p>

<p>S. Vincent was equally rigid as
to his own personal necessities, as
may be seen by the following
words from his own lips: “When
I put a morsel of bread to my
mouth, I say to myself: Wretched
man, hast thou earned the bread
thou art going to eat&mdash;the bread
that comes from the labor of the
poor?”</p>

<p>Such is the spirit of the saints.
In these days, when most people
are struggling to rise in the world,
many by undue means, and to an
unlawful height, it is well to recall
this holy example; it is good to get
a glimpse into the heart of a saint,
and to remember there are still
many in the world and in the cloister
who strive to counterbalance all
this ambition and love of display
by their humility and self-denial.</p>

<p>Immediately after S. Vincent’s
canonization, in 1737, the inhabitants
of Pouy, desirous of testifying
their veneration for his memory,
removed the house where he
was born a short distance from its
original place, without changing its
primitive form in the least, and
erected a small chapel on the site,
till means could be obtained for
building a church. The great
Revolution put a stop to the plan.
In 1821 a new effort was made, a
committee appointed, and a subscription
begun which soon amounted
to thirty thousand francs; but
at the revolution of 1830 material
interests prevailed, and the funds
were appropriated to the construction
of roads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>The ecclesiastical authorities at
length took the matter in hand, and
formed the plan, not only of building
a church, but surrounding it
with the various charitable institutions
founded by S. Vincent&mdash;a
hospital for the aged, asylums for
orphans and foundlings, and perhaps
a <i lang="fr">ferme modèle</i> in the Landes.</p>

<p>In 1850 the Bishop of Aire appealed
to the Catholic world for
aid. Pius IX. blessed the undertaking.
On the Festival of the
Transfiguration, 1851, the corner-stone
was laid by the bishop, assisted
by Père Etienne, the superior-general
of the Lazarists. Napoleon
III. and the Empress Eugénie
largely contributed to the work, and
in a few years the church and hospice
were completed. The consecration
took place April 24, 1864, in
the presence of an immense multitude
from all parts of the country.
From three o’clock in the morning
there were Masses at a dozen altars,
and the hands of the priests were
fatigued in administering the holy
Eucharist. Among the communicants
were eight hundred members
of the Society of S. Vincent de
Paul, from Bordeaux, who manifested
their joy by enthusiastic hymns.
At eight in the forenoon Père
Etienne, surrounded by Lazarists
and Sisters of Charity, celebrated
the Holy Sacrifice at the newly-consecrated
high altar, and several
novices made their vows, among
whom was a young African, a cousin
of Abdel Kader. A <i lang="fr">châsse</i> containing
relics of S. Vincent was
brought in solemn procession from
the parish church of Pouy, where
he had been held at the font and
received the divine Guest in his
heart for the first time. The road
was strewn with flowers and green
leaves. The weather was delightful
and the heavens radiant. At
the head of the procession was
borne a banner, on which S. Vincent
was represented as a shepherd,
followed by all the orphans of the
new asylum and the old men of
the hospice. Then came a long
line of <i lang="fr">Enfants de Marie</i> dressed in
white, carrying oriflammes, followed
by the students of the colleges
of Aire and Dax. Behind were
fifteen hundred members of the
Society of S. Vincent de Paul, and
a file of sisters of various orders, including
eight hundred Sisters of
Charity, with a great number of
Lazarists in the rear. Then came
thirty relatives of S. Vincent, wearing
the peasant’s costume of the
district, heirs of his virtues and
simplicity&mdash;<i lang="fr">Noblesse oblige</i>. Then
the Polish Lazarists with the flag
of their nation, beloved by S. Vincent,
and after them the clergy of
the diocese and a great number
from foreign parts, among whom
was M. Eugène Boré, of Constantinople,
now superior-general of the
two orders founded by the saint.
The shrine came next, surrounded
by Lazarists and Sisters of Charity.
Behind the canons and other dignitaries
came eight bishops, four
archbishops, and Cardinal Donnet
of Bordeaux, followed by the civil
authorities and an immense multitude
of people nearly two miles in
extent, with banners bearing touching
devices.</p>

<p>This grand procession of more
than thirty thousand people proceeded
with the utmost order, to
the sound of chants, instrumental
music, and salutes from cannon
from time to time, to the square in
front of the new church, where, before
an altar erected at the foot of
S. Vincent’s oak, they were addressed
by Père Etienne in an eloquent,
thrilling discourse, admirable
in style and glowing with imagery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
suited to the fervid nature of
this southern region. He spoke of
S. Vincent, not only as the man of
his age with a providential mission,
but of a type suited to all ages.</p>

<p>The man who loved his brethren,
reconciled enemies, brought the
rich and poor into one common
field imbued with a common idea
of sacrifice and devotion, fed the
orphan, aided the needy, and wiped
away the tears of the sufferer, is
the man of all times, and especially
of an age marked by the fomentation
of political passions.</p>

<p>The old oak was gay with streamers,
the hollow was fitted up as an
oratory, before which Cardinal Donnet
said Mass in the open air, after
which thousands of voices joined
in the solemn <cite>Te Deum Laudamus</cite>,
and the thirteen prelates terminated
the grand ceremony by giving their
united benediction to the kneeling
crowd.</p>

<p>A whole flock of Sisters of Charity,
with their dove-like plumage
of white and gray, took the same
train as ourselves the pleasant September
morning we left Bayonne
for the birth-place of S. Vincent of
Paul. They seemed like birds of
good omen. They were also going
to the <i lang="fr">Berceau</i> (cradle), as they
called it, not on a mere pilgrimage,
but to make their annual retreat.
What for, the saints alone know;
for they looked like the personification
of every amiable virtue, and
quite ready to spread their white
wings and take flight for heaven.
It was refreshing to watch their
gentle, unaffected ways, wholly devoid
of those demure airs of superior
sanctity and repulsive austerity
so exasperating to us worldly-minded
people. They all made the
sign of the cross as the train moved
out of the station&mdash;and a good honest
one it was, as if they loved the
sign of the Son of Man, and delighted
in wearing it on their breast.
Some had come from St. Sebastian,
others from St. Jean de Luz, and
several from Bayonne; but they
mingled like sisters of one great
family of charity. Some chatted,
some took out their rosaries and
went to praying with the most
cheerful air imaginable, as if it were
a new refreshment just allowed
them, instead of being the daily
food of their souls; and others
seemed to be studying with interest
the peculiar region we were now
entering. For we were now in the
Landes&mdash;low, level, monotonous,
and melancholy. The railway lay
through vast forests of dusky-pines,
varied by willows and cork-trees,
with here and there, at long distances,
an open tract where ripened
scanty fields of corn and millet
around the low cottages of the peasants.
The sides of the road were
purple with heather. The air was
full of aromatic odors. Each pine
had its broad gash cut by some
merciless hand, and its life-blood
was slowly trickling down its side.
Passing through this sad forest, one
could not help thinking of the drear,
mystic wood in Dante’s <cite>Inferno</cite>,
where every tree encloses a human
soul with infinite capacity of suffering,
and at every gash cut, every
branch lopped off, utters a despairing
cry:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent6">“Why pluck’st thou me?</div>
<div class="verse">Then, as the dark blood trickled down its side,</div>
<div class="verse">These words it added: Wherefore tear’st me thus?</div>
<div class="verse">Is there no touch of mercy in thy breast?</div>
<div class="verse">Men once were we that now are rooted here.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Though the sun was hot, the
pine needles seemed to shiver, the
branches swayed to and fro in the
air, and gave out a kind of sigh
which sometimes increased into an
inarticulate wail. We look up, almost
expecting to see the harpies
sitting</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Each on the wild thorn of his wretched shade.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Could we stop, we might question
these maimed trees and learn
some fearful tragedy from the imprisoned
spirits. Perhaps they recount
them to each other in the
wild winter nights when the peasants,
listening with a kind of fear
in their lone huts, start up from
their beds and say it is Rey Artus&mdash;King
Arthur&mdash;who is passing by
with his long train of dogs, horses,
and huntsmen, from an old legend
of the time of the English occupation
which says that King Arthur,
as he was hearing Mass on Easter-day,
attracted by the cries of his
hounds attacking their prey, went
out at the elevation of the Host.
A whirlwind carried him into the
clouds, where he has hunted ever
since, and will, without cessation or
repose, till the day of judgment,
only taking a fly every seven years.
The popular belief that he is passing
with a great noise through space
when the winds sweep across the
vast moors on stormy nights probably
embodies the old tradition of
some powerful lord whose hounds
and huntsmen ruined the crops of
the poor, who, in their wrath, consigned
them to endless barren hunting-fields
in the spirit-land&mdash;a legend
which reminds us of the <i lang="sv">Aasgaardsreja</i>
of whom Miss Bremer
tells us&mdash;spirits not good enough
to merit heaven, and yet not bad
enough to deserve hell, and are
therefore doomed to ride about till
the end of the world, carrying fear
and disaster in their train.</p>

<p>In a little over an hour we arrived
at Dax, a pleasant town on
the banks of the Adour, with long
lines of sycamores, behind which is
a hill crowned with an old château,
now belonging to the Lazarists.
The place is renowned for its thermal
springs and mud-baths, known
to the Romans before its conquest
by the Cæsars. It was from Aquæ
Augustæ, the capital of the ancient
Tarbelli (called in the Middle
Ages the <i lang="fr">ville d’Acqs</i>, or <i lang="fr">d’Acs</i>,
whence Dax), that the name of
Aquitaine is supposed to be derived.
Pliny, the naturalist, speaking
of the Aquenses, says: <i lang="la">Aquitani
indè nomen provinciæ</i>. The Bay of
Biscay was once known by the
name of Sinus Tarbellicus, from
the ancient Tarbelli. Lucan says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent5">“Tunc rura Nemossi</div>
<div class="verse">Qui tenet et ripas Aturri, quo littore curvo</div>
<div class="verse">Molliter admissum claudit Tarbellicus æquor.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>S. Vincent of Saintonge was the
first apostle of the region, and fell a
martyr to his zeal. Dax formed
part of the dowry of the daughter
of Henry II. of England when she
married Alfonso of Castile, but it
returned to the Plantagenets in the
time of Edward III. The city was
an episcopal see before the revolution
of 1793. François de Noailles,
one of the most distinguished of its
bishops, was famous as a diplomatist
in the XVIth century. He
was sent to England on several important
missions, and finally appointed
ambassador to that country
in the reign of Mary Tudor.
Recalled when Philip II. induced
her to declare war against France,
he landed at Calais, and, carefully
examining the fortifications, his
keen, observant eye soon discovered
the weak point, to which, at his
arrival in court, he at once directed
the king’s attention, declaring it
would not be a difficult matter to
take the place. His statements
made such an impression on King
Henry, who had always found him
as judicious as he was devoted to
the interests of the crown, that he
resolved to lay siege to Calais, notwithstanding
the opposition of his
ministers, and the Duke of Guise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
began the attack January 1, 1558.
The place was taken in a week. It
had cost the English a year’s siege
two hundred and ten years before.
Three weeks after its surrender
Cardinal Hippolyte de Ferrara,
Archbishop of Auch (the son of
Lucretia Borgia, who married Alphonso
d’Este, Duke of Ferrara)
wrote François de Noailles as follows:
“No one can help acknowledging
the great hand you had in
the taking of Calais, as it was actually
taken at the very place you
pointed out.” French historians
have been too forgetful of the hand
the Bishop of Dax had in the taking
of a place so important to the interests
of the nation, which added so
much to the glory of the French
arms, and was so humiliating to
England, whose anguish was echoed
by the queen when she exclaimed
that if her heart could be opened
the very name of Calais would be
found written therein!</p>

<p>This great churchman was no
less successful in his embassy to
Venice, where he triumphed over
the haughty pretensions of Philip
II., and, as Brantôme says, “won
great honor and affection.” After
five years in Italy he returned to
Dax, where he devoted most of his
revenues to relieve the misery that
prevailed at that fearful time of religious
war. Dax, as he said, was
“the poorest see in France.” In
1571 he was appointed ambassador
to Constantinople by Charles IX.
Florimond de Raymond, an old
writer of that day, tells us the
bishop was at first troubled as to
his presentation to the sultan, who
only regarded the highest dignitaries
as the dust of his feet, and exacted
ceremonies which the ambassador
considered beneath the dignity
of a bishop and a representative
of France. He resolved not
to submit to them, and, thanks to
his pleasing address, and handsome
person dressed for the occasion in
red <i lang="fr">cramoisie</i> and cloth of gold, he
was not subjected to them. Moreover,
by his fascinating manners
and agreeable conversation, he became
a great favorite of the sultan,
and took so judicious a course that
his embassy ended by rendering
France mistress of the commerce
of the Mediterranean, and giving
her a pre-eminence in the East
which she has never lost.</p>

<p>It was after his return from the
Levant that, in an interview with
Henry III., the sagacious bishop
urged the king to declare war
against Spain, as the best means of
delivering France from the horrors
of a civil war. De Thou says the
king seemed to listen favorably to
the suggestion; but it was opposed
by the council, and it was not till
ten years later that Henry IV. declared
war against that country, as
Duruy states, “the better to end
the civil war.”</p>

<p>The Bishop of Dax seems to have
been poorly remunerated for his
eminent services. Like Frederick
the Great’s father, he said kings
were always hard of hearing when
there was a question of money, and
complained that, notwithstanding
his long services abroad, he had
never received either honors or
profit. Even his appointments as
ambassador to Venice, amounting
to more than thirty thousand livres,
were still due. Many of his letters
to the king and to Marie de Médicis
have been preserved, which
show his elevation of mind, and his
broad political and religious views,
which give him a right to be numbered
among the great churchmen
of the XVIth century.</p>

<p>At Dax we took a carriage to the
<i lang="fr">Berceau</i> of S. Vincent, and, after
half an hour’s drive along a level
road bordered with trees, we came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
in sight of the great dome of the
church rising up amid a group of
fine buildings. Driving up to the
door, the first thing we observed
was the benign statue of the saint
standing on the gable against the
clear, blue sky, with arms wide-spread,
smiling on the pilgrim a
very balm of peace. Before the
church there is a broad green, at
the right of which is the venerable
old oak; at the left, the cottage of
the De Pauls; and in the rear of
the church, the asylums and hospice&mdash;fine
establishments one is surprised
to find in this remote region.
We at once entered the church,
which is in the style of the Renaissance.
It consists of a nave without
aisles, a circular apsis, and
transepts which form the arms of
the cross, in the centre of which
rises the dome, lined with an indifferent
fresco representing S. Vincent
borne to heaven by the angels.
Directly beneath is the high altar
where are enshrined relics of the
saint. Around it, at the four angles
of the cross, are statues of four
S. Vincents&mdash;of Xaintes, of Saragossa,
of Lerins, and S. Vincent
Ferrer. The whole life of S. Vincent
of Paul is depicted in the
stained-glass windows. And on the
walls of the nave are four paintings,
one representing him as a
boy, praying before Our Lady of
Buglose; the second, his first Mass
in the chapel of Notre Dame de
Grâce; in the third he is redeeming
captives, and in the fourth giving
alms to the poor.</p>

<p>We next visited the asylums, admiring
the clean, airy rooms, the
intelligent, happy faces of the orphans,
and the graceful cordiality
of the sister who was at the head
of the establishment&mdash;a lady of
fortune who has devoted her all to
the work.</p>

<p>At length we came to the cottage&mdash;the
door of the true hero to
which our path had led. The
broad, one-story house in which S.
Vincent was born is now a mere
skeleton within, the framework of
the partitions alone remaining, so
one can take in the whole at a
glance. There is the kitchen, with
the huge, old-fashioned chimney,
around which the family used to
gather&mdash;so enormous that in looking
up one sees a vast extent of
blue sky. Saint’s house though it
was, we could not help thinking&mdash;Heaven
forgive us the profane
thought!&mdash;it must have been very
much like the squire’s chimney in
<cite>Tylney Hall</cite>, the draught of which,
like the Polish game of draughts,
was apt to take backwards and discharge
all the smoke into his sitting-room!
The second room at
the left, where the saint was born,
is an oratory containing an altar,
the crucifix he used to pray before,
some of the garments he wore,
shoes broad and much-enduring as
his own nature, and many other
precious relics. Not only this, but
every room has an altar. We
counted seven, all of the simplest
construction, for the convenience
of the pilgrims who come here with
their <i lang="fr">curés</i> at certain seasons of the
year to honor their sainted countryman
who in his youth here led a
simple, laborious life like themselves.
We found several persons
at prayer in the various compartments,
all of which showed the
primitive habits and limited resources
of the family, though not
absolute poverty. The floor was
of earth, the walls and great rafters
only polished with time and the
kisses of the pilgrims, and above
the rude stairway, a mere loft
where perchance the saint slept in
his boyhood. Everything in this
cottage, where a great heart was
cradled, was from its very simplicity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
extremely touching. It seemed
the very place to meditate on the
mysterious ways of divine Providence&mdash;mysterious
as the wind that
bloweth where it listeth&mdash;the very
place to chant the <i lang="la">Suscitans à terrâ
inopem: et de stercore erigens pauperem;
ut collocet eum cum principibus,
cum principibus populi sui</i>.</p>

<p>S. Vincent’s oak, on the opposite
side of the green, looks old
enough to have witnessed the mysterious
rites of the Druids. It is
surrounded by a railing to protect
it from the pious depredations of
the pilgrim. It still spreads broad
its branches covered with verdure,
though the trunk is so hollowed by
decay that one side is entirely gone,
and in the heart, where young Vincent
used to pray, stands a wooden
pillar on which is a statue of the
Virgin, pure and white, beneath
the green bower. A crowd of artists,
<i lang="fr">savants</i>, soldiers, and princes
have bent before this venerable
tree. In 1823 the public authorities
of the commune received the
Duchess of Angoulême at its foot.
The learned and pious Ozanam,
one of the founders of the Society
of S. Vincent of Paul, came here in
his last days to offer a prayer. On
the list of foreign visitors is the
name of the late venerable Bishop
Flaget of Kentucky, of whom it is
recorded that he kissed the tree
with love and veneration, and
plucked, as every pilgrim does, a
leaf from its branches.</p>

<p>There is an herb, says Pliny,
found on Mt. Atlas; they who gather
it see more clearly. There is
something of this virtue in the oak
of S. Vincent of Paul. One sees
more clearly than ever at its foot
the infinite moral superiority of a
nature like his to the worldly ambition
of the old lords of the Landes.
Famous as the latter were in their
day, who thinks of them now?
Who cares for the lords of Castelnau,
the Seigneurs of Juliac, or
even for the Sires of Albret, whose
ancient castle at Labrit is now razed
to the ground, and, while we
write, its last traces obliterated for
ever? The shepherd whistles idly
among the ruins of their once
strong holds, the ploughman drives
thoughtlessly over the place where
they once held proud sway, as indifferent
as the beasts themselves;
but there is not a peasant in the
Landes who does not cherish the
memory of S. Vincent of Paul, or a
noble who does not respect his
name; and thousands annually visit
the poor house where he was born
and look with veneration at the oak
where he prayed.</p>

<p>Charity is the great means of
making the poor forget the fearful
inequality of worldly riches, and its
obligation reminds the wealthy
they are only part of a great brotherhood.
Its exercise softens the
heart and averts the woe pronounced
on the rich. S. John of God,
wishing to found a hospital at Granada,
and without a ducat in the
world, walked slowly through the
streets and squares with a hod on
his back and two great kettles at
his side, crying with a loud voice:
“Who wishes to do good to himself?
Ah! my brethren, for the
love of God, do good to yourselves!”
And alms flowed in from every
side. It was these appeals in the
divine name that gave him his appellation.
“What is your name?”
asked Don Ramirez, Bishop of Tuy.
“John,” was the reply. “Henceforth
you shall be called John of
God,” said the bishop.</p>

<p>And so, that we may all become
the sons of God, let us here, at the
foot of S. Vincent’s oak, echo the
words that in life were so often on
his lips:</p>

<h3>LORD CASTLEHAVEN’S MEMOIRS.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></h3>

<p>In the year 1638 the Earl of
Castlehaven, then a young man,
made the Grand Tour, as became a
nobleman of his family in that age.
Being at Rome, whither the duty
of paying his respects to the Holy
Father had carried him&mdash;for this
lord was the head of one of those
grand old families which had declined
to forswear its faith at the
behest of Henry or Elizabeth&mdash;he
received a letter from King Charles
I., requiring him to attend the king
in his expedition against the Scots,
then revolted and in arms. With
that instant loyalty which was the
return made by those proscribed
families to an ungrateful court
from the Armada down, Lord Castlehaven,
two days after the messenger
had placed the royal missive
in his hands, took post for England.
Near Turin he fell in with an army
commanded by the Marquis de Leganes,
Governor of Milan for the
King of Spain, who was marching
to besiege the Savoy capital. But
the siege was soon raised, and Lord
Castlehaven entered the town.
There he found her Royal Highness
the Duchess of Savoy in
great confusion, as if she had got
no rest for many nights, so much
had she been occupied with the
conduct of the defence; for even
the wives of this warlike and rapacious
family soon learned to defend
their own by the strong hand,
and could stretch it out to grasp
still more when occasion served.
But as yet the ambition of the
House of Savoy stopped short of
sacrilege&mdash;or stooped to it like a
hawk on short flights&mdash;nor dreamed
of aggrandizing itself with the spoils
of the whole territory of the church.
When Lord Castlehaven came to
take leave of the duchess, her royal
highness gave him a musket-bullet,
much battered, which had come in
at her window and missed her narrowly,
charging him to deliver it
safely to her sister, the Queen of
England&mdash;as it proved, a present
of ill omen; for of musket-balls, in
a little time, the English sister had
more than enough.</p>

<p>Arriving in London, Lord Castlehaven
followed the king to Berwick,
where he found the royal army encamped,
with the Tweed before it,
and the Scotch, under Gen. Leslie,
lying at some distance. A pacification
was soon effected, and both
armies partially disbanded. After
this the earl passed his time “as
well as he could” at home till 1640.
In that year the King of France
besieged Arras, and Lord Castlehaven
set out to witness the siege.
Within was a stout garrison under
Owen Roe O’Neal, commanding
for the Prince Cardinal, Governor
of the Low Countries. This was
the first meeting of Castlehaven
with the future victor of Benburb,
with whom he was afterwards
brought into closer relations in
the Irish Rebellion. The French
pressed Arras close, and the confederates
being defeated, and the
hope of the siege being raised grown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
desperate, the town was surrendered
on honorable terms. This action
over, Lord Castlehaven returned to
England and sat in Parliament till
the attainder of the Earl of Strafford.
When that great nobleman
fell, deserted by his wavering royal
master, and the king’s friends were
beginning to turn about&mdash;they
scarce knew whither&mdash;to prepare
for the storm that all men saw was
coming, Lord Castlehaven went to
Ireland, where he had some estate
and three married sisters. While
there the Rebellion of 1641 broke
out. Although innocent of any complicity
in the outbreak, his faith made
him suspected, and he was imprisoned
on a slight pretext by the lords-justices.
Escaping, his first design
was to get into France, and thence
to England to join the king at
York, and petition for a trial by his
peers. But coming to Kilkenny,
he found there the Supreme Council
of the Confederate Catholics
just assembled&mdash;many of them
being of his acquaintance&mdash;and
was persuaded by them to throw in
his lot with theirs, seeing, as they
truly told him, that they were all
persecuted on the same score, and
ruined so that they had nothing
more to lose but their lives. From
that time till the peace of 1646 he
was engaged in the war of the Confederate
Catholics, holding important
commands in the field under
the Supreme Council. His <cite>Memoirs</cite>
is the history of this war.</p>

<p>After the peace of 1646, concluded
with the Marquis of Ormond,
the king’s lord-lieutenant,
but which shortly fell through,
Lord Castlehaven retired to France,
and served as a volunteer under
Prince Rupert at the siege of Landrecies.
Then, returning to Paris,
he remained in attendance on the
Queen of England and the Prince
of Wales (Charles II.) at St. Germain
till 1648. In that year he
returned to Ireland with the lord-lieutenant,
the Marquis of Ormond,
and served the royal cause in that
kingdom against the parliamentary
forces under Ireton and Cromwell.
The battle of Worcester being lost,
and Cromwell the undisputed master
of the three kingdoms, Castlehaven
again followed the clouded
fortunes of Charles II. to France.
There he obtained permission to
join the Great Condé. In the campaigns
under that prince he had
the command of eight or nine regiments
of Irish troops, making altogether
a force of 5,000 men. Thus
we find the Irish refugees already
consolidated into a brigade some
years before the Treaty of Limerick
expatriated those soldiers whose
valor is more commonly identified
with that title.</p>

<p>Lord Castlehaven returned to
England at the Restoration. In
the war with Holland he served as
a volunteer in some of the naval
engagements. In 1667, the French
having invaded Flanders, he was
ordered there with 2,400 men to
recruit the “Old English Regiment,”
of which he was made
colonel. The peace of Aix-la-Chapelle
ended this war. Peace
reigned in the Low Countries till
the breaking out, in 1673, of the
long and bloody contest between
the Prince of Orange and the
confederate Spaniards and Imperialists
on the one side, and Louis
XIV. on the other. This was the
age of grand campaigns, conducted
upon principles of mathematical
precision by the great captains
formed in the school of M. Turenne,
before the “little Marquis of
Brandenburg”<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and the “Corsican<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
corporal” in turn revolutionized
the art of war. Castlehaven
entered the Spanish service, and
shared the checkered but generally
disastrous fortunes of the Duke
of Villahermosa and the Prince
of Orange (William III.) against
Condé and Luxembourg, till the
peace of Nymegen put an end to
the war in 1678.</p>

<p>Then, after forty years’ hard service,
this veteran retired from the
field, and returning to England,
like another Cæsar, set about writing
his commentaries on the wars.
Thus he spent his remaining years.
First he published, but without acknowledging
the authorship, his
<cite>Memoirs of the Irish Wars</cite>. This
first edition was suppressed. Then,
in 1684, appeared the second edition,
containing, besides the <cite>Memoirs</cite>,
his “Appendix”&mdash;being an
account of his Continental service&mdash;his
“Observations” on confederate
armies and the conduct of war,
and a “Postscript,” which is a
reply to the Earl of Anglesey.
And right well has the modern
reader reason to be thankful for
his lordship’s literary spirit. His
<cite>Memoirs</cite> is one of the most authentic
and trustworthy accounts
we have of that vexed passage of
Irish history&mdash;the Rebellion of
1641. Its blunt frankness is its
greatest charm; it has the value
of an account by an actor in the
scenes described; and it possesses
that merit of impartiality which
comes of being written by an Englishman
who, connected with the
Irish leaders by the ties of faith,
family, and property, and sympathizing
fully with their efforts to
obtain redress for flagrant wrongs
was yet not blind to their mistakes
and indefensible actions.</p>

<p>Castlehaven, neglected for more
than a century, has received more
justice at the hands of later historians.
He is frequently referred
to by Lingard, and his work will be
found an admirable commentary on
Carte’s <cite>Life of Ormond</cite>. There
is a notice of him in Horace Walpole’s
<cite>Catalogue of Royal and Noble
Authors</cite> (vol. iii.)</p>

<p>“If this lord,” says Walpole, “who
led a very martial life, had not taken the
pains to record his own actions (which,
however, he has done with great frankness
and ingenuity), we should know little
of his story, our historians scarce
mentioning him, and even our writers
of anecdotes, as Burnet, or of tales and
circumstances, as Roger North, not giving
any account of a court quarrel occasioned
by his lordship’s <cite>Memoirs</cite>. Anthony
Wood alone has preserved this
event, but has not made it intelligible.
… The earl had been much censured
for his share in the Irish Rebellion, and
wrote the <cite>Memoirs</cite> to explain his conduct
rather than to excuse it; for he freely
confesses his faults, and imputes them to
provocations from the government of that
kingdom, to whose rashness and cruelty,
conjointly with the votes and resolutions
of the English Parliament, he ascribes
the massacre. There are no dates nor
method, and less style, in these <cite>Memoirs</cite>&mdash;defects
atoned for in some measure by a
martial honesty. Soon after their publication
the Earl of Anglesey wrote to ask
a copy. Lord Castlehaven sent him one,
but denying the work as his. Anglesey,
who had been a commissioner in Ireland
for the Parliament, published Castlehaven’s
letter, with observations and reflections
very abusive of the Duke of
Ormond, which occasioned first a printed
controversy, and this a trial before
the Privy Council; the event of which
was that Anglesey’s first letter was voted
a scandalous libel, and himself removed
from the custody of the Privy Seal; and
that the Earl of Castlehaven’s <cite>Memoirs</cite>, on
which he was several times examined, and
which he owned, was declared a scandalous
libel on the government&mdash;a censure
that seems very little founded; there is
not a word that can authorize that sentence
from the Council of Charles II. but the
imputation on the lords-justices of
Charles I.; for I suppose the Privy Council
did not pique themselves on vindicating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the honor of the republican Parliament!
Bishop Morley wrote <cite>A True
Account of the Whole Proceeding between
James, Duke of Ormond, and Arthur,
Earl of Anglesey</cite>.”</p>

<p>Immediately after the Restoration,
as it is well known, an act was
passed, commonly called in that
age “the Act of Oblivion,” by
which all penalties (except certain
specified ones) incurred in the
late troublous and rebellious times
were forgiven. So superfine would
have been the net which the law
of treason would have drawn around
the three kingdoms, had its strict
construction been enforced, that it
was quite cut loose, a few only of
the greatest criminals and regicides
being held in its meshes. So harsh
had been Cromwell’s iron rule that
there were few counties of England
in which the stoutest squires, and
even the most loyal, might not have
trembled had the king’s commission
inquired too closely into the
legal question of connivance at the
late tyrant’s rule. And in the
great cities, London especially, the
tide of enthusiasm which now ran
so strongly for the king could not
hide the memory of those days
when the same fierce crowds had
clamored for the head of the “royal
martyr.” Prudent it was, as well
as benign, therefore, for the “merry
monarch” to let time roll smoothly
over past transgressions. But
though the law might grant oblivion,
and even punish the revival
of controversies, the old rancor between
individuals and even parties
was not so easily appeased after
the first joyful outburst. Books
and pamphlets by the hundred
brought charges and counter
charges. But these “authors of
slander and lyes,” as Castlehaven
calls them, outdid themselves in
their tragical stories of the Irish
Rebellion of 1641. Nor have imitators
been wanting in this age, as
rancorous and more skilful, in the
production of “fictions and invectives
to traduce a whole nation.”
To answer those calumnies by “setting
forth the truth of his story in
a brief and plain method” was the
design of Castlehaven’s work.</p>

<p>Then, as now, it was the aim of
the libellers of the Irish people to
make the whole nation accountable
for the “massacre,” so called, of
1641, and to confound the war of
the Confederate Catholics and the
later loyal resistance to Cromwell
in one common denunciation with
the first sanguinary and criminal
outbreak. Lord Castlehaven’s narrative
effectually disposes of this
charge. In a singularly clear and
candid manner he narrates the rise
and progress of the insurrection,
and shows the wide difference between
the aims and motives of
those who planned the uprising of
October 23, 1641, and of those who
afterwards carried on the war under
the title of the Confederate
Catholics of Ireland. The former
he does not hesitate to denounce
as a “barbarous and inhumane”
conspiracy, but the responsibility
for it he fixes in the right quarter&mdash;the
malevolent character of the
Irish government and the atrocious
spirit of the English Puritan
Parliament, which, abandoning all
the duties of protection, kept only
one object in view&mdash;the extirpation
of the native Irish.</p>

<p>With the successful example of
the Scotch Rebellion immediately
before them, it was a matter of little
wonder to observant and impartial
minds in that age that the
Irish should have seized upon the
occasion of the growing quarrel
between the king and Parliament
as the opportune moment for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
redress of their grievances. For
in the year 1640, two years after
the pacification of Berwick, the
Scotch Rebellion, primarily instigated
by the same cause as the
Irish&mdash;religious differences&mdash;broke
out with greater violence than ever.
The Scots’ army invaded England,
defeated the king’s troops at Newburn,
and took Newcastle. Then,
driven to extremity by those Scotch
rebels, as mercenary as they were
fanatical,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and his strength paralyzed
by the growing English sedition,
Charles I. called together
“that unfortunate Parliament”
which, proceeding from one violence
to another, first destroyed its
master, and then was in turn destroyed
by its own servant. Far
from voting the Scotch army rebels
and traitors, the Parliament at once
styled them “dear brethren” and
voted them £300,000 for their kindness.
Mr. Gervase Holles was expelled
from the House for saying
in the course of debate “that the
best way of paying them was by
arms to expel them out of the
kingdom.” The quarrel between
King and Commons grew hotter,
until finally it became evident that,
notwithstanding Charles’ concessions,
a violent rupture could not
be long delayed.</p>

<p>No fairer opportunity could be
hoped for by the Irish leaders, dissatisfied
with their own condition,
and spurred on by the hope of
winning as good measure of success
as the Scotch. The plan to
surprise the Castle of Dublin and
the other English garrisons was
quickly matured; but failing, some
of the conspirators were taken and
executed, and the rest forced to retire
to the woods and mountains.
But the flame thus lighted soon
spread over the whole kingdom,
and occasioned a war which lasted
without intermission for ten years.</p>

<p>The following reasons are declared
by Castlehaven to have been
afterwards offered to him by the
Irish as the explanation of this insurrection:</p>

<p>First, that, being constantly looked
upon by the English government
as a conquered nation, and
never treated as natural or free-born
subjects, they considered
themselves entitled to regain their
liberty whenever they believed it
to be in their power to do so.</p>

<p>Secondly, that in the North, where
the insurrection broke out with the
greatest violence, six whole counties
had been escheated to the
crown at one blow, on account of
Tyrone’s rebellion; and although
it was shown that a large portion
of the population of those counties
was innocent of complicity in that
rising, nothing had ever been restored,
but the whole bestowed by
James I. upon his countrymen.
To us, who live at the distance of
two centuries and a half from those
days of wholesale rapine, these
confiscations still seem the most
gigantic instance of English wrong;
but who shall tell their maddening
effect upon those who suffered from
them in person in that age&mdash;the
men flying to the mountains, the
women perishing in the fields, the
children crying for food they could
not get?</p>

<p>Thirdly, the popular alarm was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
heightened by the reports, current
during Strafford’s government in
Ireland, that the counties of Roscommon,
Mayo, Galway, and Cork,
and parts of Tipperary, Limerick,
and Wicklow, were to share the
fate of the Ulster counties. It
hardly needs the example of our
own Revolution to prove the truth
of Castlehaven’s observation upon
this project: “That experience tells
us where the people’s property is
like to be invaded, neither religion
nor loyalty is able to keep them
within bounds if they find themselves
in a condition to make any
considerable opposition.” And this
brings to his mind the story related
by Livy of those resolute ambassadors
of the Privernates, who, being
reduced to such extremities that
they were obliged to beg peace of
the Roman Senate, yet, being asked
what peace should the Romans expect
from them, who had broken it
so often, they boldly answered&mdash;which
made the Senate accept their
proposals&mdash;“If a good one, it shall
be faithful and lasting; but if bad,
it shall not hold very long. For
think not,” said they, “that any
people, or even any man, will continue
in that condition whereof
they are weary any longer than of
necessity they must.”</p>

<p>Fourthly, it was notorious that
from the moment Parliament was
convened it had urged the greatest
severities against the English Roman
Catholics. The king was compelled
to revive the penalties of the
worst days of Edward and Elizabeth
against them. His own consort
was scarce safe from the violence
of those hideous wretches
who concealed the vilest crimes
under the garb of Puritan godliness.
Readers even of such a common
and one-sided book as Forster’s
<cite>Life of Sir John Eliot</cite> will be surprised
to find the prominence and
space the “Popish” resolutions and
debates occupied in the sittings of
Parliament. The popular leaders
divided their time nearly equally
between the persecution of the
Catholics and assaults upon the
prerogative. The same severities
were now threatened against the
Irish Catholics. “Both Houses,”
says Castlehaven, “solicited, by
several petitions out of Ireland, to
have those of that kingdom treated
with the like rigor, which, to a
people so fond of their religion as
the Irish, was no small inducement
to make them, while there was an
opportunity offered, to stand upon
their guard.”</p>

<p>Fifthly, the precedent of the
Scotch Rebellion, and its successful
results&mdash;pecuniarily, politically,
and religiously&mdash;encouraged the
Irish so much at that time that
they offered it to Owen O’Conally
as their chief motive for rising in
rebellion; “which,” says he (quoted
by Castlehaven), “they engaged in
to be rid of the tyrannical government
that was over them, and to
imitate Scotland, who by that
course had enlarged their privileges”
(O’Conally’s <cite>Exam.</cite>, October
22, 1641; Borlace’s <cite>History of the
Irish Rebellion</cite>, p. 21).</p>

<p>To the same purpose Lord Castlehaven
quotes Mr. Howell in his
<cite>Mercurius Hibernicus</cite> in the year
1643; “whose words, because an
impartial author and a known Protestant,
I will here transcribe in confirmation
of what I have said and
for the reader’s further satisfaction”:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Moreover,” says Mr. Howell, “they
[the Irish] entered into consideration
that they had sundry grievances and
grounds of complaint, both touching
their estates and consciences, which they
pretended to be far greater than those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the Scots. For they fell to think that
if the Scot was suffered to introduce
a new religion, it was reason they
should not be punished in the exercise
of their old, which they glory never to
have altered; and for temporal matters,
wherein the Scot had no grievance at all
to speak of, the new plantations which
had been lately afoot to be made in Connaught
and other places; the concealed
lands and defective titles which were
daily found out; the new customs which
were enforced; and the incapacity they
had to any preferment or office in church
or state, with other things, they considered
to be grievances of a far greater
nature, and that deserved redress much
more than any the Scot had. To this end
they sent over commissioners to attend
this Parliament in England with certain
propositions; but they were dismissed
hence with a short and unsavory answer,
which bred worse blood in the nation
than was formerly gathered. And this,
with that leading case of the Scot, may
be said to be the first incitements that
made them rise.… Lastly, that
army of 8,000 men which the Earl of
Strafford had raised to be transported
into England for suppressing the Scot,
being by the advice of our Parliament
here disbanded, the country was annoyed
by some of those straggling soldiers.
Therefore the ambassadors from
Spain having propounded to have some
numbers of those disbanded soldiers for
the service of their master, his majesty,
by the mature advice of his Privy Council,
to occur the mischiefs that might
arise to his kingdom of Ireland from
those loose cashiered soldiers, yielded to
the ambassadors’ motion. But as they
were in the height of that work (providing
transports), there was a sudden stop
made of those promised troops; and this
was the last, though not the least, fatal
cause of that horrid insurrection.</p>

<p>“Out of these premises it is easy for
any common understanding, not transported
with passion or private interest,
to draw this conclusion: That they who
complied with the Scot in his insurrection;
they who dismissed the Irish commissioners
with such a short, impolitic
answer; they who took off the Earl of
Strafford’s head, and afterwards delayed
the despatching of the Earl of Leicester;
they who hindered those disbanded
troops in Ireland to go for Spain, may
be justly said to have been the true
causes of the late insurrection of the
Irish.</p>

</div>

<p>“Thus,” continues Castlehaven,
“concludes this learned and ingenious
gentleman, who, as being then
his majesty’s historiographer, was
as likely as any man to know the
transactions of those times, and, as
an Englishman and a loyal Protestant,
was beyond all exception of
partiality or favor of the Papists of
Ireland, and therefore could have
no other reason but the love of
truth and justice to give this account
of the Irish Rebellion, or
make the Scotch and their wicked
brethren in the Parliament of England
the main occasion of that
horrid insurrection.”</p>

<p>As for the “massacre,” so called,
that ensued, Lord Castlehaven
speaks of it with the abhorrence it
deserves. But this very term “massacre”
is a misnomer plausibly
affixed to the uprising by English
ingenuity. In a country such as
Ireland then was&mdash;in which, though
nominally conquered, few English
lived outside the walled towns&mdash;an
intermittent state of war was chronic;
and therefore there was none
of that unpreparedness for attack
or absence of means of defence on
the part of the English settlers
which, in other well-known historical
cases, has rightfully given the
name of “massacre” to a premeditated
murderous attack upon defenceless
and surprised victims. To
hold the English as such will be regarded
with contemptuous ridicule
by every one acquainted with the
system of English and Scotch colonization
in Ireland in that age.
The truth is, the cruelties on both
sides were very bloody, “and
though some,” says Lord Castlehaven,
“will throw all upon the Irish,
yet ’tis well known who they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
that used to give orders to their
parties sent into the enemies’ quarters
to spare neither man, woman,
nor child.” And as to the preposterous
muster-rolls of Sir John
Temple&mdash;from whom the subsequent
scribblers borrowed all their
catalogues&mdash;giving <em>fifty thousand (!)</em>
British natives as the number killed,
Lord Castlehaven’s testimony is to
the effect that there was not one-tenth&mdash;or
scarcely five thousand&mdash;of
that number of British natives
then living in Ireland outside of the
cities and walled towns where no
“massacre” was committed. Lord
Castlehaven also shows that there
were not 50,000 persons to be found
even in Temple’s catalogue, although
it was then a matter of common
notoriety that he repeats the
same people and the same circumstances
twice or thrice, and mentions
hundreds as then murdered
who lived many years afterwards.
Some of Temple’s, not the Irish,
victims were alive when Castlehaven
wrote.</p>

<p>But the true test of the character
of this insurrection is to be found,
not in the exaggerated calumnies
of English libellers writing after the
event, but in the testimony of the
English settlers themselves when
in a position where lies would have
been of no avail. We will therefore
give here, though somewhat
out of the course of our narrative,
an incident related by Castlehaven
to that effect.</p>

<p>Shortly after he had been appointed
General of the Horse under
Preston, Commander-in-Chief
of the Confederate Catholics in
Leinster, that general took, among
other places, Birr, in King’s County.
Here Castlehaven had the
good fortune, as he says, to begin
his command with an act of charity.
For, going to see this garrison
before it marched out, he came into
a large room where he found
many people of quality, both men
and women. They no sooner saw
him but, with tears in their eyes,
they fell on their knees, desiring
him to save their lives. “I was astonished,”
says Castlehaven, “at
their posture and petition, and, having
made them rise, asked what the
matter was? They answered that
from the first day of the war there
had been continued action and
bloodshed between them and their
Irish neighbors, and little quarter
on either side; and therefore, understanding
that I was an Englishman,
begged I would take them
into my protection.” It is enough
to say that Lord Castlehaven, with
some difficulty, and by personally
taking command of a strong convoy,
obtained for them the protection
they prayed for from the exasperated
and outraged population
around them. But what we wish to
point out is this: that here are
those victims of Sir John Temple’s
“massacre”&mdash;not the garrison of
the fort, observe, but the English
settlers driven in by the approach of
Preston’s army, after terrorizing the
country for months&mdash;now, with the
fear of death before them, confessing
on their knees that from the
first day of the war they had arms
in their hands, and that little quarter
was given on either side!</p>

<p>How well the English were able
to take care of themselves at this
time, and what <em>their</em> “massacres”
were like, are shown by the following
extract from a letter of Colonel
the Hon. Mervin Touchett to his
brother, Lord Castlehaven. Col.
Touchett is describing a raid made
by Sir Arthur Loffens, Governor of
Naas, with a party of horse and
dragoons, killing such of the Irish
as they met, to punish an attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
upon an English party a few days
before: “But the most considerable
slaughter was in a great strength
of furze, scattered on a hill, where
the people of several villages (taking
the alarm) had sheltered themselves.
Now, Sir Arthur, having
invested the hill, set the furze on
fire on all sides, where the people,
being a considerable number, were
all burned or killed, men, women,
and children. I saw the bodies and
the furze still burning.”</p>

<p>We remember the horror-stricken
denunciations of the English press
some years ago when it was stated,
without much authentication, that
some of the French commanders in
the Algerine campaigns had smoked
some Arabs to death in caves.
But it would seem from Col.
Touchett’s narrative that the English
troopers would have been able
to give their French comrades lessons
in the culinary art of war
some centuries ago. A grilled
Irishman is surely as savory an object
for the contemplation of humanity
as a smoked Arab!</p>

<p>But whatever the atrocities on
the English side, we will not say
that the cruelties committed by the
Irish were not deserving of man’s
reprobation and God’s anger.
Only this is to be observed: that
whereas the “massacres” by the
Irish were confined to the rabble
and Strafford’s disbanded soldiers,
those committed by the English
side were shared in, as the narratives
of the day show, by the persons
highest in position and authority.
They made part of the English
system of government of that
day. On the other hand, the leading
men of the Irish Catholic body
not only endeavored to stay those
murders, but sought to induce the
government to bring the authors of
them on both sides to punishment.
But in vain! On the 17th of
March, 1642, Viscount Gormanstown
and Sir Robert Talbot, on behalf
of the nobility and gentry of
the nation, presented a remonstrance,
praying “that the murders
on both sides committed should
be strictly examined, and the
authors of them punished according
to the utmost severity of the
law.” Which proposal, Castlehaven
shrewdly remarks, would never
have been rejected by their adversaries,
“but that they were conscious
of being deeper in the mire
than they would have the world
believe.”</p>

<p>So far the “massacre” and first
uprising.</p>

<p>Now, as to the inception of the
war of the Confederate Catholics,
and its objects, Lord Castlehaven’s
narrative is equally convincing and
clear.</p>

<p>Parliament met in the Castle of
Dublin, Nov. 16, 1641. The Rebellion
was laid before both Houses
by the lords-justices, Sir William
Parsons and Sir John Borlace. Concurrent
resolutions were adopted,
without a dissenting voice, by the
two Houses, declaring their abhorrence
of the Rebellion, and pledging
their lives and fortunes to suppress
it. Castlehaven had a seat in
the Irish House of Lords as an
Irish peer, and being then in Ireland,
as before related, took his
seat at the meeting of Parliament.
Besides Castlehaven, most of the
leaders of the war that ensued
were members of the Irish House
of Lords. These Catholic peers
were not less earnest than the rest
in their unanimous intention to put
down the Rebellion. Both Houses
thereupon began to deliberate upon
the most effectual means for its
suppression. “But this way of proceeding,”
says Castlehaven, “did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
not, it seems, square with the lords-justices’
designs, who were often
heard to say that ‘the more were
in rebellion, the more lands should
be forfeit to them.’” Therefore, in
the midst of the deliberations of
Parliament on the subject, a prorogation
was determined on. The
lords, understanding this, sent Castlehaven
and Viscount Castelloe to
join a deputation from the commons
to the lords-justices, praying
them not to prorogue, at least till
the rebels&mdash;then few in number&mdash;were
reduced to obedience. But
the address was slighted, and Parliament
prorogued the next day, to
the great surprise of both Houses
and the “general dislike,” says
Castlehaven, “of all honest and
knowing men.”</p>

<p>The result was, as the lords-justices
no doubt intended, that
the rebels were greatly encouraged,
and at once began to show themselves
in quarters hitherto peaceful.
The members of Parliament retired
to their country-houses in much
anxiety after the prorogation. Lord
Castlehaven went to his seat at
Maddingstown. There he received
a letter, signed by the Viscounts of
Gormanstown and Netterville, and
by the Barons of Slane, Lowth,
and Dunsany, containing an enclosure
to the lords-justices which
those noblemen desired him to
forward to them, and, if possible,
obtain an answer. This letter to
the lords-justices, Castlehaven says,
was very humble and submissive,
asking only permission to send
their petitions into England to
represent their grievances to the
king. The only reply of the lords-justices
was a warning to Castlehaven
to receive no more letters
from them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, parties were sent out
from Dublin and the various garrisons
throughout the kingdom to
“kill and destroy the rebels.” But
those parties took little pains to distinguish
rebels from loyal subjects,
provided they were only Catholics,
killing promiscuously men, women,
and children. Reprisals followed
on the part of the rebels. The
nobility and gentry were between
two fires. A contribution was levied
upon them by the rebels, after the
manner of the Scots in the North of
England in 1640. But although to
pay that contribution in England
passed without reproach, in Ireland
it was denounced by the lords-justices
as treason. The English
troopers insulted and openly threatened
the most distinguished Irish
families as favorers of the Rebellion.
“This,” says Castlehaven, “and the
sight of their tenants, the harmless
country people, without respect to
age or sex, thus barbarously murdered,
made the Catholic nobility
and gentry at last resolved to
stand upon their guard.” Nevertheless,
before openly raising
the standard of revolt against
the Irish government, which refused
to protect them, they made
several efforts to get their petitions
before Charles I. Sir John Read,
a Scotchman, then going to England,
undertook to forward petitions
to the king; but, being arrested
on suspicion at Drogheda,
was taken to Dublin, and there put
upon the rack by the lords-justices
to endeavor to wring from him a
confession of Charles I.’s complicity
in the Rebellion. This Col.
Mervin Touchett heard from Sir
John Read himself as he was
brought out of the room where he
was racked. But that unfortunate
monarch knew not how to choose
his friends or to be faithful to them
when he found them. He referred
the whole conduct of Irish affairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
to the English Parliament, thus increasing
the discontent to the last
pitch by making it plain to the
whole Irish people that he abandoned
the duty of protecting them,
and had handed them over to the
mercy of their worst enemies&mdash;the
English Parliament. That Parliament
at once passed a succession
of wild votes and ordinances, indicating
their intention of stopping
short at nothing less than utter extirpation
of the native race. Dec.
8, 1641, they declared they would
never give consent to any toleration
of the Popish religion in Ireland.
In February following, when few of
any estate were as yet engaged in
the Rebellion, they passed an act
assigning two million five hundred
thousand acres of cultivated land,
besides immense tracts of bogs,
woods, and mountains, to English
and Scotch adventurers for a small
proportion of money on the grant.
This money, the act stated, was to
go to the reduction of the rebels;
but, with a fine irony of providence
upon the king’s weak compliance,
every penny of it was afterwards
used to raise armies by the English
rebels against him. “But the
greatest discontent of all,” says
Castlehaven, “was about the lords-justices
proroguing the Parliament&mdash;the
only way the nation had to
express its loyalty and prevent
their being misrepresented to their
sovereign, which, had it been permitted
to sit for any reasonable
time, would in all likelihood, without
any great charge or trouble,
have brought the rebels to justice.”</p>

<p>Thus all hopes of redress or safety
being at an end&mdash;a villanous
government in Dublin intent only
upon confiscation, a furious Parliament
in London breathing vengeance
against the whole Irish race,
and a king so embroiled in his English
quarrels that he could do nothing
to help his Irish subjects, even
had he wished it&mdash;what was left
those loyal, gallant, and devoted
men but to draw the sword for their
own safety? The Rebellion by degrees
spread over the whole kingdom.
“And now,” says Castlehaven,
“there’s no more looking
back; for all were in arms and full
of indignation.” A council of the
leading Catholic nobles, military
officers, and gentry met at Kilkenny,
and formed themselves into an
association under the title of the
Confederate Catholics of Ireland.
Four generals were appointed for
the respective provinces of the kingdom&mdash;Preston
for Leinster, Barry
for Munster, Owen Roe O’Neale
for Ulster, and Burke for Connaught.
Thus war was declared.</p>

<p>When the Rebellion first broke
out in the North, Lord Castlehaven
had immediately repaired to Dublin
and offered his services to
the lords-justices. They were declined
with the reply that “his religion
was an obstacle.” After the
prorogation of Parliament, as we
have seen, he retired to his house in
the country. Then, coming again
to Dublin to meet a charge of corresponding
with the rebels which
had been brought against him, he
was arrested by order of the lords-justices,
and, after twenty weeks of
imprisonment in the sheriff’s house,
was committed to the Castle. “This
startled me a little,” says Castlehaven&mdash;as
it well might do; for the
state prisoner’s exit from the Castle
in Dublin in those days was usually
made in the same way as from
the Tower in London, namely,
by the block&mdash;“and brought into
my thoughts the proceedings against
the Earl of Strafford, who, confiding
in his own innocence, was voted
out of his life by an unprecedented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
bill of attainder.” Therefore,
hearing nothing while in prison
but rejoicings at the king’s misfortunes,
who at last had been forced
to take up arms by the English
rebels, and knowing the lords-justices
to be of the Parliament faction,
and the lord-lieutenant, the
Marquis of Ormond, being desperately
sick of a fever, not without
suspicion of poison, and his petition
to be sent to England, to be
tried there by his peers, being refused,
he determined to make his
escape, shrewdly concluding, as he
says, that “innocence was a scurvy
plea in an angry time.”</p>

<p>Arriving at Kilkenny, he joined
the confederacy, as has been related.</p>

<p>From this time the war of the
Confederate Catholics was carried
on with varying success until the
cessation of 1646, and then until the
peace of 1648, when the Confederates
united, but too late, with the
Marquis of Ormond to stop the
march of Cromwell.</p>

<h3>THE COLPORTEURS OF BONN.</h3>

<p>I was very stupid in my youth,
and am still far from being sharp.
I could not master knotty questions
like other boys; so this natural deficiency
had to be supplemented by
some plan that would facilitate the
acquisition of knowledge. The advantage
to be derived from a garrulous
preceptor, whose mind was
stored with all sorts of learning
without dogmatism or hard formularies,
were fully appreciated by my
parents. John O’Neil was a very
old man when I was a boy, and he
was just the person qualified to impart
an astonishing quantity of all
sorts of facts, and perhaps fancies.
I hold him in affectionate remembrance
though he be dead over
twenty-five years, and rests near the
remains of his favorite hero, O’Connell,
in Glasnevin Cemetery. When
he became the chief architect of
my intellectual structure, I thought
him the most learned man in the
world. On account of my dulness,
he adopted the method of sermonizing
to me instead of giving me unintelligible
lessons to be learned
out of books. I took a great fancy
to him, because I found him exceedingly
interesting, and he evinced a
strong liking for me because I was
docile. We became inseparable
companions, notwithstanding the
great discrepancy in our years.
His tall, erect, lank figure and lantern
jaw were to me the physiological
signs of profundity, firmness,
and power, and his white head was
the symbol of wisdom. Our tastes&mdash;well,
I had no tastes save such as
he chose to awaken in me, and
hence there came to be very soon
a great similitude in our respective
inclinations. I was like a ball of
wax, a sheet of paper, or any other
original impressionable thing you
may name, in his hands for ten
years, after which very probably I
began to harden, though I was not
conscious of the process. However,
the large fund of knowledge that he
imparted to me crystallized, as it
were, and became fixed in my possession
as firmly as if it had been
elaborately achieved by a severe
mental training. After I went to
college he was still my friend, and
rejoiced in my subsequent successes,
and followed me with a jealous eye
and a sort of parental anxiety in
my foreign travels, and even in
death he did not forget me, for he
made me the custodian of his great
heaps of literary productions, all in
manuscript, embracing sketches,
diaries, notes of travel, learned fragments
on scientific and scholastic
topics, essays, tales, letters, the beginnings
and the endings and the
middles of books on history, politics,
and polemics, pieces of pamphlets
and speeches, with a miscellaneous
lot of poetry in all measures. He
was a great, good man, who never
had what is called an aim in life,
but he certainly had an aim <em>after</em>
life; and yet no one could esteem
the importance of this pilgrimage
more than he did. He would frequently
boast of being heterodox
on that point. “You will hear,”
he would remark, “people depreciating
this life as a matter of little
concern. Don’t allow their sophistry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
to have much weight with you.
The prevalent opinions which are
flippantly spoken thereon will not
stand the test of sound Christian
reasoning. That part of human
existence which finds its scene and
scope of exertion in this life is filled
with eternal potentialities. You
have heard it said that man wants
but little here below. Where else
does he want it? Here is where
he wants everything. Then do not
hesitate to ask, but be careful not
to ask amiss. When the battle is
over, it will be too late to make requisitions
for auxiliaries. If you
conquer, assistance will not be
wanted; if you are defeated, assistance
cannot reach you. The
fight cannot be renewed; the victory
or defeat will be final. This
life is immense. You cannot think
too much of it, cannot estimate it
too highly. A minute has almost
an infinite value. Man wants much
here, and wants it all the time.” I
thought his language at that time
fantastical; now I regard it as profound.
From a survey of his own
aimless career, it is evident he did
not reduce the good of earthly existence
of which he spoke to any sort
of money value. Those elements and
forces of life to which he attached
such deep significance and importance
could not have their equivalent
in currency, nor in comforts, nor in
real estate, nor even in fame. My
old preceptor had spent most of his
youth in travelling, and the picturesque
meanderings of the Rhine
furnished subjects for many of his
later recollections. I recall now
with a melancholy regret the many
pleasant evenings I enjoyed listening
to his narratives of travel on that
historic river, and in imagination sat
with him on the Drachenfels’ crest,
looking down upon scenes made
memorable by the lives and struggles
of countless heroes and the crowds
of humanity that came and went
through the course of a hundred
generations&mdash;some leaving their
mark, and others erasing it again;
some leaving a smile behind them
on the face of the country, and
others a scar. He loved to talk
about the beautiful city of Bonn,
where he had spent some years, it
being the most attractive place, he
said, from Strasbourg to the sea&mdash;for
learning was cheap there, and so
were victuals&mdash;the only things he
found indispensable to a happy life.
He would glide into a monologue
of dramatic glow and fervor in reciting
how he procured access to
the extensive library of its new university,
and, crawling up a step-ladder,
would perch himself on top
like a Hun, who, after a sleep of a
thousand years, had resurrected
himself, gathered his bones from
the plains of Chalons, and having
procured a second-hand suit of modern
clothes from a Jew in Cologne,
traced with eager avidity the vicissitudes
of war and empire since the
days of Attila. It was there, no
doubt, he discovered the materials
of this curious paper, which I found
among his literary remains. Whether
he gathered the materials himself,
or merely transcribed the work
of some previous writer, I am unable
to determine. Without laying any
claim to critical acumen, I must
confess it appears to me to be a
meritorious piece, and I picked it
out, because I thought it unique
and brief, for submission to the
more extensive experience and
more impartial judgment of <span class="smcap">The
Catholic World’s</span> readers. Having
entire control of these productions
of my friend and preceptor,
I took the liberty of substituting
modern phraseology for what was
antique, and of putting the sketch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
in such style that the most superficial
reader will have no difficulty
in running it over. Objection may
be raised to the title on the score
of fitness. I did not feel authorized
to change it, believing the one
chosen by the judgment of my old
friend as suitable as any I could
substitute.</p>

<p class="break">In the year 1250 the mind of
man was as restless and impatient
of restraint as now, and some people
in Bonn, under a quiet exterior,
nursed in their bosoms latent volcanoes
of passion, and indulged the
waywardness of rebellious fancy to
a degree that would have proved
calamitous to the placid flow of
life and thought could instrumentality
for action have been found.
There is indubitable proof that the
principle of the Reformation, which
three hundred years later burst
through the environment of dogma
and spread like a flood of lava over
Europe, existed actively in Bonn in
the year named, and would have
arrived at mature strength if nature
had not interposed an impassable
barrier to the proceeding. It is
hard to rebel against nature, and it
is madness to expect success in
such a revolt. Fourteen men, whose
names have come down to us, gave
body and tone, and a not very clearly
defined purpose, to this untimely
uprising against the inevitable in
Bonn. How many others were in
sympathy or in active affiliation
with them is not shown. Those
fourteen were bold spirits, who labored
under the misfortune of having
come into the world three or
four centuries too soon. They
were great men out of place. There
is an element of rebellion in great
spirits which only finds its proper
antidote in the stronger and more
harmonious principle of obedience.
Obedience is the first condition of
creatures. Those fourteen grew
weary of listening to the Gospel
preached every Sunday from the
pulpit of S. Remigius, when they
attended Mass with the thousands
of their townsmen. The Scriptures,
both New and Old, were given out
in small doses, with an abundant
mixture of explanation and homily
and salutary exhortation. Their appetites
craved a larger supply of
Scripture, and indeed some of them
were so unreasonable as to desire
the reading of the whole book, from
Genesis to Revelations, at one service.
“Let us,” said Giestfacher,
“have it all. No one is authorized
to give a selection from the Bible
and hold back the rest. It is our
feast, and we have a right to the full
enjoyment thereof.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Heuck, his neighbor,
to whom he addressed the remonstrance;
“go to the scrivener’s
and purchase a copy and send your
ass to carry it home. Our friend
Schwartz finished a fine one last
week. It can be had for sixteen
hundred dollars. When you have
it safe at home, employ a reader,
who will be able to mouth it all off
for you in fifty hours, allowing a few
intervals for refreshment, but none
for sleep.” And Heuck laughed, or
rather sneered, at Giestfacher as he
walked away.</p>

<p>Giestfacher was a reformer, however,
and was not to be put down
in that frivolous manner. He had
been a student himself with the
view of entering the ministry, but,
being maliciously charged with certain
grave irregularities, his prospects
in that direction were seriously
clouded, and in a moment of
grand though passionate self-assertion
he threw up his expectations
and abandoned the idea of entering
the church, but instead took to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
world. He was a reformer from
his infancy, and continually quarrelled
with his family about the
humdrum state of things at home;
was at enmity with the system of
municipal government at Bonn; and
held very animated controversies
with the physicians of the place on
the system of therapeutics then pursued,
insisting strongly that all diseases
arose from bad blood, and that
a vivisection with warm wine would
prove a remedy for everything.
He lacked professional skill to attempt
an experiment in the medical
reforms he advocated; besides, that
department would not admit of
bungling with impunity. For municipal
reforms he failed in power,
and the reward in fame or popular
applause that might follow successful
operations in that limited sphere
of action was not deemed equivalent
to the labor. But in the field
of religion there was ample room
for all sorts of tentative processes
without danger; and, in addition
to security, notoriety might be obtained
by being simply <i lang="fr">outré</i>. He
had settled upon religious reform,
and his enthusiasm nullified the
cautionary suggestions of his reason,
and reduced mountains of difficulty
to the insignificant magnitude
of molehills; even Heuck could
be induced to adopt his views by
cogent reasoning and much persuasion.
Enthusiasm is allied to madness&mdash;a
splendid help, but a dangerous
guide.</p>

<p>Giestfacher used his tongue, and
in the course of a year had made
twelve or fourteen proselytes.
Those who cannot enjoy the monotony
of life and the spells of <i lang="fr">ennui</i>
that attack the best-regulated temperaments,
fly to novelty for relief.
The fearful prospect of an unknown
and nameless grave and an oblivious
future drives many restless
spirits into experiments in morals
and in politics as well as in natural
philosophy, in the vain hope of rescuing
their names from the “gulf
of nothingness” that awaits mediocrity.
The new reformers, zealous
men and bold, met in Giestfacher’s
house on Corpus Christi
in 1251, the minutes of which meeting
are still extant; and from that
record I learn there were present
Stein the wheelwright, Lullman the
baker, Schwartz the scrivener,
Heuck the armorer, Giestfacher
the cloth merchant, Braunn, another
scrivener, Hartzwein the vintner,
Blum the advocate, Werner, another
scrivener, Reudlehuber, another
scrivener, Andersen, a stationer,
Esch the architect, Dusch the
monk, discarded by his brethren
for violations of discipline, and
Wagner the potter. Blum was appointed
to take an account of the
proceedings, and Giestfacher was
made president of the society.</p>

<p>“We are all agreed,” said Giestfacher,
“that the Scriptures ought
to be given to the people. From
these divine writings we learn a
time shall come when wars shall
cease, and the Alemanni and the
Frank and the Tartar may eat from
the same plate and drink out of the
same cup in peace and fraternity,
and wear cloth caps instead of
brass helmets, and plough the fields
with their spears instead of letting
daylight through each other therewith,
and the shepherds shall tend
their flocks with a crook and not
with a bow to keep off the enemy.
How can that time come unless the
people be made acquainted with
those promises? I believe we, who,
like the apostles, number fourteen,
are divinely commissioned to change
things for the better, and initiate
the great movements which will
bring about the millennium. Let us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
rise up to the dignity of our position.
Let us prove equal to the inspiration
of the occasion. We are called together
by heaven for a new purpose.
The time is approaching when universal
light will dispel the gloom,
and peace succeed to all disturbance.
Let us give the Scriptures
to the people. They are the words
of God, that carry healing on their
wings. They are the dove that was
sent out from the ark. They are
the pillar of light in the desert.
They are the sword of Joshua, the
sling of David, the rod of Moses.
Let us fourteen give them to the
people, and start out anew, like the
apostles from Jerusalem, to overturn
the idols of the times and
emancipate the nations. We have
piled up heaps of stones in every
town and monuments of brass, and
still men are not changed. We see
them still lying, warring, hoarding
riches, and making gods of their
bellies&mdash;all of which is condemned
by the word of God. What will
change all this? I say, let the piles
of stone and the monuments of
brass slide, and give the Scriptures
a chance. Let us give them to
the people, and the reign of brotherhood
and peace will commence,
wars shall cease, nation will no
longer rise up against nation, rebellion
will erect its horrid front no
more. Men will cease hoarding
riches and oppressing the poor.
There will be no more robbing rings
in corporate towns, and men in
power will not blacken their character
and imperil the safety of the
state by nepotism. The whole
world will become pure. No scandals
will arise in the church, and
there will be no blasphemy or false
swearing, and Christian brethren
shall not conspire for each other’s
ruin.”</p>

<p>“We see,” remarked Heuck, “that
those who have the Scriptures are
no better than other people. They
too are given to lying, hoarding
riches, warring one against another,
and making gods of their bellies.
How is that?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Blum, “I know three
scriveners of this town who boast
of having transcribed twenty Bibles
each, and they get drunk thrice a
week and quarrel with their wives;
and there’s Giebricht, the one-legged
soldier, who can repeat the
Scriptures until you sleep listening
to him, says he killed nine men in
battle and wounded twenty others.
The Scriptures did not make him
very peaceful. The loss of a leg
had a more quieting effect on him
than all his memorizing of the sacred
books.”</p>

<p>“We did not get together,” said
Werner, “to discuss that phase of
the subject. It was well understood,
and thereunto agreed a
month ago, that the spread of the
Scriptures was desirable; and to
this end we met, that means wise
and effective may be devised whereby
we can supply every one with
the word of God, that all may search
therein for the correct and approved
way of salvation.”</p>

<p>“So be it,” said Dusch the
monk.</p>

<p>“Hear, hear!” said Schwartz.</p>

<p>“Let us agree like brethren,”
said Braunn.</p>

<p>“We are subject to one spirit,”
said Hartzwein the vintner, “and
all moved by the same inspiration.
Discord is unseemly. We must
not dispute on the subject of drunkenness.
Let us have the mature
views of Brother Giestfacher, and
his plans. The end is already clear
if the means be of approved piety
and really orthodox. In addition
to the Scriptures, I would rejoice
very much to see prayer more generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
practised. We ought to do
nothing without prayer. Let us
first of all consult the Lord. What
says Brother Blum?”</p>

<p>Blum rose and said it was a purely
business meeting. He had no
doubt it ought to have been opened
with prayer. It was an old and
salutary practice that came down
from the days of the apostles, and
Paul recommended it. But as they
were now in the midst of business,
he thought it would be as wise and
as conformable with ancient Christian
and saintly practice to go on
with their work, and rest satisfied
with mental ejaculation, as to inaugurate
a formal prayer-meeting.</p>

<p>Esch thought differently; he
held that prayer was always in
season.</p>

<p>Reudlehuber meekly said that the
Scriptures showed there was a time
for everything, whence it was plain
that prayer might be out of place as
well as penitential tears on some occasions.
It would not look well for
a man to rise up in the midst of
a marriage feast and, beating his
breast, cry out <i lang="la">Mea culpa</i>.</p>

<p>“We have too many prayers in
the church,” said Giestfacher, “and
not enough of Scripture; that is
the trouble with us. Brethren
must rise above the weaknesses of
the mere pietist. Moses was no
pietist; he was a great big, leonine
character. We must be broad and
liberal in our views; not given
to fault-finding nor complaining.
Pray whenever you feel like it, and
drink when you have a mind to.
Noah got drunk. I’d rather be
the prodigal son, and indulge in a
hearty natural appetite for awhile,
than be his cautious, speculating,
avaricious brother, who had not
soul enough most likely to treat
his acquaintances to a pint of wine
once in his lifetime. Great men
get tipsy. Great nations are bibulous.
We are not here to make
war on those who drink wine and
cultivate the grape, nor are we authorized
in making war on weavers
because Dives was damned for
wearing fine linen. It is our mission
to spread the Scriptures. The
world wants light. He is a benefactor
of mankind who puts two
rays where there was only one before.”</p>

<p>“Let us hear your plans, Brother
Giestfacher,” cried out a number of
voices simultaneously.</p>

<p>In response, Brother Giestfacher
stated that there were no plans
necessary. All that was to be done
was to circulate the Scriptures. Let
us get one hundred thousand sheets
of vellum to begin with, and set a
hundred scriveners to work transcribing
copies of the Bible, and
then distribute these copies among
the people.</p>

<p>The plan was plain and simple
and magnificent, Braunn thought,
but there were not ten thousand
sheets of vellum in the town nor in
the whole district, and much of that
would be required for civil uses;
besides, the number of sheep in the
neighborhood had been so reduced
by the recent war that vellum
would be scarce and costly for ten
years to come.</p>

<p>Werner lamented the irremediable
condition of the world when
the free circulation of the word
of God depended on the number of
sheep, and the number of sheep was
regulated by war, and war by the
ambition, jealousy, or pride of
princes.</p>

<p>“It is painfully true,” said Heuck,
“that the world stands in sad need
of reform, if souls are to be rescued
from their spiritual perils only by
the means proposed in the magnificent
sheep-skin scheme of Brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Giestfacher.” It was horrible to
think that the immortal part of man
was doomed to perish, to be snuffed
out, as it were, in eternal darkness,
because soldiers had an unholy appetite
for mutton.</p>

<p>Braunn said the work could be
started on three or four thousand
hides, and ere they were used up a
new supply might arrive from some
unexpected quarter.</p>

<p>Esch said that they ought to
have faith; the Hand that fed
the patriarch in the desert would
provide vellum if he was prayerfully
besought for assistance. <em>He</em>
would be willing to commence on
one sheet, feeling convinced there
would be more than enough in the
end.</p>

<p>Blum did not take altogether so
sanguine a view of things as Brother
Esch. He was especially dubious
about that vellum supply; not
that he questioned the power of
Providence at all, but it struck him
that it would be just as well and as
easy for the society to prayerfully ask
for an ample supply of ready-made
Bibles as to expect a miracle in
prepared sheep-skin; and he was
still further persuaded that if the
books were absolutely necessary to
one’s salvation, they would be miraculously
given. But he did not
put the movement on that ground.
It is very easy for men, and particularly
idiotic men, to convince themselves
that God will answer all their
whims and caprices by the performance
of a miracle. We are going
upon the theory that the work is
good, just as it is good to feed the
hungry and clothe the naked. We
expect to find favor in heaven because
we endeavor to do a work of
charity according to our honest impression.</p>

<p>“How many persons,” inquired
Heuck, “do you propose to supply
with complete copies of the Scriptures?”</p>

<p>“Every one in the district,” replied
Giestfacher.</p>

<p>“Brother Dusch,” continued
Heuck, “how many heads of
families are there in the district?
Your abbot had the census taken a
few month’s ago, while you were yet
in grace and favor at the monastery.”</p>

<p>Brother Dusch said he heard
there were twenty-two thousand
from the Drachenfels to within six
miles of Cologne, but all of them
could not read.</p>

<p>“We will send out,” said Giestfacher
enthusiastically, “an army
of colporteurs, who will distribute
and read at the same time.”</p>

<p>“I perceive,” said Blum, “that
this discussion will never stop. New
avenues of thought and new mountains
of objection are coming to
view at every advance in the debate.
Let us do something first,
and talk afterwards. To supply
twenty-two thousand persons with
expensive volumes will require considerably
more than mere resolves
and enthusiasm. I propose that
we buy up all the vellum in the city
to-day, and that we all go security
for the payment. I propose also
that we employ Brothers Braunn,
Schwartz, Werner, and Reudlehuber
to commence transcribing, and
that we all go security for their pay.
Unless we begin somewhere, we
can never have anything done.
What says Brother Giestfacher?”</p>

<p>Giestfacher said it did not become
men of action, reformers who
proposed to turn over the world
and inaugurate a new era and a new
life and a new law, to stop at trifles
or to consider petty difficulties.
The design that had been developed
at that meeting contemplated a
sweeping change. Instead of having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
a few books, here and there, at
every church, cathedral, monastery,
and market-place, learnedly
and laboriously expounded by
saints of a thousand austerities and
of penitential garb, every house
would be supplied, and there should
be no more destitution in the land.
The prophecies and the gospels
and the mysteries of revelation
would be on the lips of sucking
babes, and the people who stood at
the street-corners and at the marts
of trade, the tiller of the soil, the
pedler, the sailor, the old soldier,
and the liberated prisoner, together
with the man who sold fish and
the woman who sold buttermilk,
would stand up and preach the Gospel
and display a mission, schoolboys
would discuss the contents of
that book freely, and even the inmates
of lunatic asylums would
expound it with luminous aptitude
and startling fancy. The proposition
of Brother Blum met his entire
approval. He would pledge
everything he had, and risk even life
itself, to start the new principle, so
that the world might bask in
sunshine and not in shadow. It
was about time that men had their
intellects brightened up some.
Even in the days of the apostles
those pious men did not do their
whole duty. They labored with
much assiduity and conscientiousness,
but they neglected to adopt
measures looking to the spread of
the Scriptures. He had no doubt
but they fell a long way short of
their mission, and were now enduring
the pangs of a peck of purgatorial
coal for their remissness.
There were good men who perhaps
found heaven without interesting
themselves in the multiplication of
copies of the Bible. They were not
called to that work; but what was to
be thought of those who had the
call, the power, the skill, and yet
neglected to spread the word. He
believed SS. Gregory Nazianzen,
Athanasius, Jerome, Chrysostom,
Augustine, and others of those
early doctors of the church, had a
fearful account to render for having
neglected the Scriptures. S. Paul,
too, was not free from censure. It
was true he wrote a few things, but
he took no thought of multiplying
copies of his epistles.</p>

<p>“How many copies,” inquired
Heuck, “do you think S. Paul ought
to have written of his letters before
you would consider him blameless?”</p>

<p>“He ought,” said Giestfacher,
“to have written all the time instead
of making tents. ‘How
many copies’ is a professional
question which I will leave the
scriveners to answer. I may remark
that it would evidently be unprofitable
for us to enter on a minute
and detailed discussion on that
point here. It is our duty to supplement
the shortcomings of those
early workers in the field, and
finish what they failed to accomplish.
They were bound to give
the new principle a fair start. The
plan suggested was the best, simplest,
and clearest, and he hoped
every one of the brethren would
give it a hearty and cordial
support.”</p>

<p>The principle of communism, or
the right of communities to govern
themselves in certain affairs and to
carry on free trade with certain
other communities, had been granted
the previous century, and Bonn
was one of the towns that enjoyed
the privilege; but the people still
respected religion and did no trafficking
on holydays. Giestfacher
could not therefore purchase the
vellum on Corpus Christi, but had
to wait till next day, at which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
time he could not conveniently find
the other members of the new Bible
society, and, fearing that news of
their project would get abroad and
raise the price of the article he
wanted, he hastened to the various
places where it was kept for sale,
and bought all of it up in the
course of two hours, paying his
own money in part and giving his
bond for the balance. The parchment
was delivered to the four
scriveners, who gathered their families
about them, and all the assistants
(journeymen) that could be
found in the town, and proceeded
with the transcribing of the Bible.
At the next meeting each scrivener
reported that he had about half a
book ready, that the work was going
rapidly and smoothly forward,
and that the scribes were enthusiastic
at the prospect of brisk business
and good pay. The report
was deemed very encouraging.
It went to show that the society
could have four Bibles every two
weeks, or about one hundred a
year, and that in the course of two
hundred and twenty years every
head of a family in the district could
be provided with a Bible of his
own. The scriveners stated, moreover,
that they had neglected their
profane business, for which they
could have got cash, to proceed in
the sacred work, and as there were
several people depending on them
for means of living, a little money
would be absolutely necessary with
the grace of God.</p>

<p>Giestfacher also stated that he
spent all the money he had in part
payment for the parchment, and
pledged his property for the balance.
His business was somewhat
crippled already in consequence of
the outlay, and he expected to have
part of the burden assumed by every
one of the society.</p>

<p>Werner said he had fifteen transcribers
working for him, and each
one agreed to let one-third of the
market value of his work remain in
the hands of the society as a subscription
to the good work, but the
other two-thirds would have to be
paid weekly, as they could not live
without means. They were all
poor, and depending solely on their
skill in transcribing for a living.</p>

<p>The debate was long, earnest,
eloquent, and more or less pious.</p>

<p>Blum made a motion that the
bishop of the diocese and the Pope
be made honorary members of the
society. Giestfacher opposed this
with eloquent acrimony, saying it
was a movement outside of all sorts
of church patronage; that it was
designed to supersede churches
and preaching; for when every man
had the Bible he would be a church
unto himself, and would not need
any more teaching. He also had a
resolution adopted pledging each
and every member to constitute
himself a colporteur of the Bible,
and to read and peddle it in sun and
rain; and it was finally settled that
a subscription should be taken up;
that each member of the society be
constituted a collector, and proceed
at once to every man who loved
the Lord and gloried in the Gospel
to get his contribution.</p>

<p>At the next meeting the brethren
were all present except Dusch, who
was reported as an absconder with
the funds he had collected, and was
said to be at that moment in Cologne,
drunk perhaps. Four complete
Bibles were presented as the
result of two weeks’ hard labor and
pious effort and the aggregate production
of forty-five writers. The
financial reports on the whole were
favorable; and the scriveners were
provided with sufficient means and
encouragement to begin another set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
of four Bibles. Brother Giestfacher
was partially secured in his venture
for the parchment, while it was said
that the article had doubled in price
during the past fortnight, and very
little of it could be got from Cologne,
as there was a scarcity of it
there also, coupled with an extraordinary
demand. It was also
stated that the monks at the monastery
had to erase the works of
Virgil in order to find material for
making a copy of the homilies of S.
John Chrysostom which was wanted
for the Bishop of Metz. In like
manner, it was decided to erase the
histories of Labanius and Zozirnus,
as being cheaper than procuring
original parchment on which to
transcribe a fine Greek copy of the
whole Bible, to take the place of one
destroyed by the late war. The
heavy purchase that Brother Giestfacher
had made created a panic in
the vellum market that was already
felt in the heart of Burgundy. The
scriveners’ business had also experienced
a revulsion. People of
the world who wanted testamentary
and legal documents, deeds, contracts,
and the like properly engrossed,
were offering fabulous sums
to have the work done, as most of
the professionals of that class were
now engaged by the society, and
had no time to do any other sort
of writing. A debate sprung up as
to the proper disposition to be
made of the four Bibles on hand,
and also as to the manner of beginning
and conducting the distribution.
In view of the demand
for the written word, and of the
scarcity of copies and the high
price of parchment, it was suggested
by Heuck to sell them, and divide
the proceeds among the poor and
the cripples left after the late war.
Five hundred dollars each could
be readily got for the books, he
said, and it was extremely doubtful
whether those who would get them
as gifts from the society would resist
the temptation of selling them
to the first purchaser that came
along. In addition to this heavy
reason in favor of his line of policy,
Heuck suggested the possibility of
trouble arising when they should
come to grapple with the huge difficulties
of actual distribution; to
give one of those volumes, he said,
would be like giving an estate and
making a man wealthy for life.</p>

<p>Giestfacher said it would be impracticable
to make any private
distribution among the destitute for
some time. The guilds of coopers,
tailors, shoemakers, armorers, fullers,
tanners, masons, artificers, and
others should be first supplied;
and in addition to the Bible kept
chained in the market-place for all
who wished to read, he would have
one placed at the town-pump and
one at the town-house, so that the
thirsty might also drink the waters
of life, and those who were seeking
justice at the court might ascertain
the law of God before going
in.</p>

<p>Blum said another collection
would have to be raised to erect a
shed over the Bibles that were proposed
to be placed at the town-pump
and at the town-house and
to pay for suitable chains and
clasps to secure them from the depredations
of the pilfering.</p>

<p>Esch was of opinion that another
subscription could not be successfully
taken up until their work
had produced manifest fruit for
good. The people have much
faith, but when they find salt mixed
with their drink instead of honey,
credulity is turned into disgust. A
Bible chained to the town-pump
will be a sad realization of their
extravagant hopes. Every man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
who subscribed five dollars expects
to get a book worth five hundred,
an illuminated Bible fit for a cathedral
church. He warned them that
they were getting into a labyrinth,
and that they would have to resort
to prayer yet to carry them through
in safety. Werner thought it would
be wisest to pursue a quiescent
policy for some time, and to forego
the indulgence of their anxious desire
for palpable results until they
should be in a condition to make
an impression. He advocated the
wisdom of delay. They also serve,
he said, who only stand and wait,
and it might prove an unwise proceeding
to come out with their
public exhibition just then. In a
few months, when thirty or forty
Bibles would be on hand, a larger
number than could be found in any
library in the world, they might
hope, by the show of so much labor,
to create enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“But still,” urged Heuck, “you
will have the difficulty to contend
with&mdash;who is to get them?”</p>

<p>“There will,” remarked Blum, “be
a greater difficulty to contend with
about that time: the settlement of
obligations for parchment and the
pay of the scriveners who are employed
in transcribing. Our means
at present, even if we pay the scriveners
but one-third their wages, will
not suffice to bring out twenty volumes.
So we are just in this difficulty:
in order to do something, we
must have means, and in order to
get means, we must do something.
It is a sort of vicious circle projected
from logic into finance. It
will take the keen-edged genius
of Brother Giestfacher to cut this
knot.”</p>

<p>“The work,” said Giestfacher, “in
which we are engaged is of such
merit that it will stand of itself. I
have no fears of ultimate triumph.
If you all fail, God and I will carry
it on. Heaven is in it. I am in it.
It must succeed. I am a little oldish,
I confess, but there is twenty
years of work in me still. I feel
my foot sufficiently sure to tread
the perilous path of this adventure
to the goal.”</p>

<p>“Let us,” interposed Schwartz,
“stop this profitless debate, and
give a cheer to Brother Giestfacher.
He is the blood and the bone of
this movement. We are in with
him. We are all in the same boat.
If we have discovered a pusillanimous
simpleton among us, it is not
too late to cast him out. I feel my
gorge and my strength rise together,
and I swear to you by S. Remigius,
brethren, that I am prepared to sink
or swim, and whoever attempts to
scuttle the ship shall himself perish
first.”</p>

<p>Two or three other brethren, feeling
the peculiar inspiration of the
moment, rose up and, stamping their
feet on the floor, proclaimed their
adherence to the principles of the
society, and vowed to see it through
to the end.</p>

<p>This meeting then adjourned.</p>

<p>There is no minute of any subsequent
meeting to be found among
the manuscripts that I have consulted,
but I discovered a statement
made by Heuck, dated six
months later, who, being called before
the municipal authorities to
testify what he knew about certain
transactions of a number of men
that had banded themselves together
secretly for the purpose of creating
a panic in the vellum market,
and of disturbing the business of
the scriveners, said he was one of
fourteen citizens interested in the
promulgation of the Gospel free to
the poor. That, after five or six
meetings, he left the society in company
with two others; that two of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the members became obnoxious,
and were expelled&mdash;the one, Dusch,
for embezzling money collected for
Scripture-writing and Scripture-diffusing
purposes, the other, Werner,
for having retained one of their
volumes, and disposed of it to the
lord of Drachenfels for four hundred
dollars; that they did not
pursue and prosecute these delinquents
for fear of bringing reproach
on the project; and then he went
on to state: “I left the society voluntarily
and in disgust. We had
fourteen Bibles on hand, but could
not agree about their distribution.
They were too valuable to give
away for nothing, and it was discovered
that they were all written
in Latin, and not in the vernacular,
and they would prove of as little value
to the great mass of people for
whom they were originally designed
as if they had been written in Hebrew.
In addition to this I found,
for I understand the language perfectly,
that no two of them were
alike, and, in conjunction with scrivener
Schwartz, I minutely examined
one taken at random from the
pile, and compared it with the volume
at the Cathedral. We found
fifteen hundred discrepancies. In
some places whole sentences were
left out. In others, words were
made to express a different sense
from the original. In others, letters
were omitted or put in redundantly,
in such a way as to change the
meaning; and the grammatical
structure was villanously bad. Seeing
that the volumes were of no
use as a representation of the word
of God, and being conscientiously
convinced that the books contained
poison for the people instead of
medicine, I made a motion in meeting
to have them all burned.
Schwartz opposed it on the ground
that they were innoxious anyhow,
there being none of the common
people capable of understanding
the language in which they were
written, and, though they were a
failure as Bibles, the vellum might
be again used; and as the scriveners
were not paid for their labor,
they had a claim upon the volumes.
The scriveners got the books, to
which, in my opinion, they had no
just claim, for the villanous, bad
work they did on them deserved
censure and not pay. I have heard
since that some of those scriveners
made wealth by selling the books to
Englishmen for genuine and carefully
prepared transcripts from authorized
texts. The president and
founder of the society, Giestfacher,
is now in jail for debt, he having
failed to meet his obligations for
the vellum he purchased when he
took it into his head to enlighten
mankind&mdash;more especially that portion
of it that dwells on the Rhine
adjacent to the city of Bonn&mdash;by
distributing corrupt copies of Latin
Bibles to poor people who are not
well able to read their own language.
The ‘good work’ still occupies
the brains and energies of
three or four enthusiasts, who have
already arrived at the conclusion
that the apostles were in league
with hell to keep the people ignorant,
because they did not give
every man a copy of the Bible. The
founder sent me a letter two days
ago, in which he complains of being
deserted by his companions in
his extremity. His creditors have
seized on all his goods, and there
is a considerable sum yet unpaid.
He blames the Pope and the bishop
in unmeasured terms for this; says
it is a conspiracy to keep the Bible
from the people. He sees no prospect
of being released unless the
members of the society come to his
speedy relief. The principles, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
says, for which he suffers will yet
triumph. The time will come when
Bibles will be multiplied by some
cheap and easy process. Until then,
the common run of humanity must
be satisfied to be damned, drawing
what little consolation they may
from the expectation that their descendants
a few centuries hence
will enjoy the slim privilege of reading
Bibles prepared with as little regard
to accuracy as these were. I am
sorry to see such a noble intellect
as Giestfacher undoubtedly possesses
show signs of aberration. The
entire failure of his project was
more than he could bear. He had
centred his hopes upon it. He
indulged dreams of fame and greatness
arising out of the triumph of
his idea. Esch has become an
atheist. He says the Christian’s
God would not have given a book
to be the guide and dependence of
man for salvation, and yet allow
nature, an inferior creation, to interpose
insuperable barriers to its promulgation.
Every time a sheep-skin
is destroyed, says Esch, a community
is damned. The dearness
and scarcity of parchment keep
the world in ignorance. Braunn
says the world cannot be saved except
by a special revelation to every
individual, for there is hardly a
copy of the Bible without errors, so
that whether every human creature
got one or not, they would be still unsafe.
One of the common herd must
learn Latin and Greek and Hebrew
well, and then spend a lifetime
tracing up, through all its changes,
transcriptions, and corruptions of
idiom, one chapter, or at most one
book, and die before he be fully assured
of the soundness of one text, a
paragraph, a line, a word. In fact,
says Braunn, there can be no certainty
about anything. Language
may have had altogether a different
meaning twelve hundred years ago
to what it has now. Braunn and
Schwartz and myself wanted to
have a committee of five of our
number appointed to revise and
correct the text of each book that
was produced by comparing it with
such Greek and Hebrew copies as
were represented of sound and correct
authority; but Giestfacher
laughed at us, saying we knew nothing
of Greek or Hebrew; that we
would have to hire some monks to
do the job for us, which would be
going back again to the very places
and principles and practices against
which we had revolted and protested.
Moreover, continued Giestfacher,
we cannot tell whether the
oldest, most original copies that
can be found are true in every particular.
How can we know from
any sort of mere human testimony
that this copy or that is in accordance
with what the prophets and
apostles wrote. The whole Bible may
be wrong as far as our <em>knowledge</em>, as
such, is able to testify. We are reduced
to <em>faith</em> in this connection
and must rest on that alone.</p>

<p>“I thought, and so did Schwartz,
that the faith of Giestfacher must
be peculiar when it could accept
copies as good enough and true
enough after we had discovered
hundreds of palpable and grievous
errors in them. A book of romance
would do a person of Giestfacher’s
temper as well as the Bible&mdash;faith
being capable of making up for all
deficiencies. I saw that an extravagance
of credulity, called faith, on
the part of Giestfacher, led to monomania;
and a predominance of
irrational reason on the part of
Esch had led to utter negation. I
did not covet either condition, and
I concluded to remain safe at anchor
where I had been before, rather
than longer follow those adventurers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
in a wild career after a
fancied good&mdash;a mere phantom of
their own creation. I lost twenty-five
dollars by the temporary madness.
That cannot be recalled. I
rejoice that I lost no more, and I
am grateful that the hallucination
which lasted nearly a year has passed
away without any permanent
injury.”</p>

<p>The remainder of Heuck’s statement
had partially faded from the
parchment by time and dampness,
and could not be accurately made
out. Sufficient was left visible,
however, to show that he expressed
a desire to be held excusable for
whatever injuries to souls might result
from the grave errors that existed
in the Bibles disseminated by
the cupidity of the scriveners with
the guilty knowledge of such errors.</p>

<p>I interested myself in rescuing
from oblivion such parts of the record
of those curious mediæval
transactions as served to show to
the people of later times what extraordinary
mental and religious activity
existed in those ages, when it
was foolishly and stupidly thought
there were but henchmen and slaves
on the one side, and bloody mailed
despots on the other. The arrogance
of more favored epochs has
characterized those days by the
epithet of “dark.” Pride is apt to
be blind. The characterization is
unjust. All the lights of science
could not come in one blaze. The
people of those days looked back
upon a period anterior to their own
as “dark,” and those looked still
further backward upon greater obscurity,
as they thought. The universal
boastfulness of man accounts
for this increasing obscurity as we
reach back into antiquity. Philosophers
and poets and men of learning,
thinking themselves, and wishing
to have other people think them,
above personal egotism, adopted the
method of praising their age, and
thus indirectly eulogizing, themselves;
and as they could not compare
their times with the future of
which they knew nothing, they naturally
fell into the unfilial crime of
drawing disparaging comparisons
with their fathers. There is an inclination,
too, in the imperfection of
human nature to belittle what is remote
and magnify what is near at
hand. Even now, men as enthusiastic
and conscientious and religious
as Heuck and Giestfacher and
Schwartz find themselves surrounded
by the same difficulties, and as
deeply at a loss to advance a valid
reason for their revolt and their
protest.</p>

<h3>EARLY PERSECUTIONS OF THE CHRISTIANS.</h3>

<p>In one of his bold Apologies<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
the great African writer Tertullian
said to the rulers of the Roman Empire
that “it was one and the same
thing for the truth [of Christianity]
to be announced to the world, and
for the world to hate and persecute
it.” This persecution of the church
began on the very spot that was her
birth-place; for soon after the ascension
of our Lord the wicked
Jews tried by every means to crush
her. “From the days of the apostles,”
wrote Tertullian in the IIId
century, “the synagogue has been
a source of persecutions.” At first
the church was attacked by words
only; but these were soon replaced
by weapons, when Stephen was
stoned, the apostles were thrown
into prison and scourged, and all
the East had risen in commotion
against the Christians. The Gentiles
soon followed the example of
the Jews, and those persecutions
which bore an official character
throughout the Roman Empire, and
lasted for three centuries, are commonly
called the Ten General Persecutions.
Besides these, there
were partial persecutions at all
times in some part or other of the
empire. Nero, whose name is synonymous
with cruelty, was the
first emperor to begin a general persecution
of the Christians; and
Tertullian made a strong point in
his favor when he cried out to the
people (<cite>Apol. v.</cite>), saying, “That
our troubles began at such a
source, we glory; for whoever has
studied his nature knows well that
nothing but what is good and great
was ever condemned by Nero.”
This persecution began in the year
64, and lasted four years. Its pretext
was the burning of Rome, the
work of the emperor himself, who
ambitiously desired, when he would
have rebuilt the city and made it
still more grand, to call it by his
own name; but the plan not succeeding,
he tried to avert the odium
of the deed from his own person,
and accused the Christians. Their
extermination was decreed. The
pagan historian Tacitus has mentioned,
in his <cite>Annals</cite> (xv. 44), some
of the principal torments inflicted
on the Christians. He says that
they were covered with the skins of
wild beasts and torn to pieces by
savage hounds, were crucified, were
burned alive, and that some, being
coated with resinous substances,
were put up in the imperial garden
at night to serve as human torches.
The <cite>Roman Martyrology</cite> makes a
special commemoration, on the
24th of June, of these martyrs
for having all been disciples of
the apostles and the firstlings of
the Christian flock which the
church in Rome presented to the
Lord. In this persecution S. Peter
was crucified with his head
downwards; S. Paul was beheaded;
and among the other more illustrious
victims we find S. Mark the
Evangelist, S. Thecla, the first martyr
of her sex, SS. Gervase and
Protase at Milan, S. Vitalis at Ravenna,
and S. Polycetus at Saragossa
in Spain. The number of the
slain, and the hitherto unheard-of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
cruelties practised upon them,
moved to pity many of the heathen,
and the sight of so much
fortitude for a principle of religion
was the means, through divine
grace, of many conversions. After
this, as after every succeeding persecution,
the great truth spoken by
Tertullian was exemplified: that the
blood of the martyrs was the seed
of Christians.</p>

<p>By a law of the empire, which
was not revoked until nearly three
hundred years afterwards, under
Constantine, the profession of the
Christian religion was made a capital
offence. This law, it is true,
was not enforced at all times, especially
under benign or indifferent
rulers; but it hung continually suspended
over the heads of the Christians
like a sword of Damocles.</p>

<p>The second persecution was that
of Domitian, from 94 to 96. Tertullian
calls him “a portion of Nero
by his cruelty.” At first he
only imposed heavy fines upon the
wealthy Christians; but, thirsting
for blood, he soon published more
cruel edicts against them. Among
his noblest victims were his cousin-german,
Flavius Clemens, a man of
consular dignity; John the Evangelist,
who was thrown into a caldron
of boiling oil (from which, however,
he miraculously escaped unhurt);
Andrew the Apostle, Dionysius
the Areopagite, and Onesimus,
S. Paul’s convert. Hegesippus, quoted
by Eusebius in his <cite>Ecclesiastical
History</cite>, has recorded a very interesting
fact about the children of
Jude, surnamed Thaddeus in the
Gospel, telling us that, having confessed
the faith under this reign,
they were always honored in the
church of Jerusalem, not alone as
martyrs, but as relatives of Jesus
Christ according to the flesh.</p>

<p>The third persecution was Trajan’s,
from 97 to 116. In answer to
a letter from his friend Pliny the
Younger, who had command in
Asia Minor, the emperor ordered
that the Christians were not to be
sought out, but that, if accused,
and they remained obstinate in their
faith, they were to be put to death.
Under an appearance of mercy a
large field was opened for the
cruelty and exactions of Roman
officials, which they were not slow
to work. A single circumstance
attests the severity of the persecution.
This was that the Tiberian
governor of Palestine wrote to the
emperor complaining of the odious
duty imposed upon him, since the
Christians were forthcoming in greater
numbers than he could, without
tiring, have executed. The persecution
was particularly severe in
the East. Simeon, bishop of Jerusalem,
Ignatius of Antioch, and the
virgin Domitilla, who was related to
three emperors, are among the more
illustrious martyrs of the period.</p>

<p>Next came the persecution of
Hadrian, lasting from 118 to about
129. We have the authority of S.
Jerome for saying that it was very
violent. This emperor was a coward
and, perhaps as a consequence,
intensely superstitious. One of his
particular grievances against the
Christians was that they professed
a religion in which he had no share.
Under him perished, with countless
others, Pope Alexander I. and his
priests, Eventius and Theodulus;
Eustace, a celebrated general, with
his wife and little children; Symphorosa
and her seven sons; Zoe,
with her husband and two children.</p>

<p>The fifth was the persecution of
Marcus Aurelius. Although he
was by nature well inclined, he
was certainly the author of much
innocent bloodshed, which may be
in part ascribed to the powerful influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
of the so-called philosophers
whose company and tone he
affected. The persecution raged
most severely among the Gauls;
and elsewhere we find the illustrious
names of Justin the great Apologist,
Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna,
and Felicitas and her seven children.</p>

<p>Followed the persecution of
Septimius Severus, which lasted
from 200 to 211, and was so extremely
violent that many Christians
believed Antichrist had come.
It reaped from the church such distinguished
persons as Pope Victor
at Rome; Leonidas, father of the
great Origen, at Alexandria; Irenæus
and companions at Lyons;
Perpetua and Felicitas in Mauritania.
Egypt was particularly rich
in holy martyrs.</p>

<p>After this one came the persecution
of Maximinus, from 235 to
237. It was in the beginning more
especially directed against the sacred
ministers of the church. Several
popes were put to death; and
among the inferior clergy we find
the deacon Ambrose, who was the
bosom friend of Origen and one of
his principal assistants in his work
on the Holy Scriptures.</p>

<p>The persecution of Decius lasted
from 249 to 251. The Christians,
in spite of all repressive measures,
had steadily increased in numbers;
but this emperor thought to do
what his predecessors had failed
in, and was hardly seated on the
throne before he published most
cruel edicts against them. Among
the more celebrated names of this
persecution are those of Popes
Fabian and Cornelius; Saturninus,
first bishop of Toulouse; Babylas,
bishop of Antioch; the famous
Christopher in Lycia, about whom
there is a beautiful legend; and the
noble virgin Agatha in Sicily. The
great scholar Origen was put to
the torture during this persecution,
but escaped death. Like Maximinus,
this emperor singled out
the heads of the various local
churches, the most active and
learned ministers, the highest of
both sexes in the social scale, aiming
less at the death than the apostasy
of Christians, hoping in this
way to destroy the faith; whence
S. Cyprian laments in one of his
epistles that the Christians suffer
atrocious torments without the
final consolation of martyrdom.
One effect of this persecution was
of immense benefit to the church
in the East; for S. Paul, surnamed
First Hermit, took refuge from the
storm in Upper Egypt, where he
peopled by his example the region
around Thebes with those holy
anchorites since called the Fathers
of the Desert.</p>

<p>The ninth persecution was that
of Valerian, who, although at first
favorable to the Christians, became
one of their greatest opposers at
the instigation of their sworn
enemy, Marcian. At this date we
find upon the list of martyrs the
eminent names of Popes Stephen
and Sixtus II., Lawrence the Roman
deacon, and Cyprian, the great
convert and bishop of Carthage.</p>

<p>The persecution of Diocletian
was the last and the bloodiest of
all. It raged from 303 to 310.
Maximian, the emperor’s colleague,
had already put to death many
Christians, and among others, on
the 22d of September, 286, Maurice
and his Theban legion, before
the persecution became general
throughout the Roman Empire. It
began in this form at Nicomedia
on occasion of a fire that consumed
a part of the imperial palace,
and which was maliciously ascribed
to the Christians; and it is remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
that the two extreme
persecutions of the early church
should both have begun with a
false charge of incendiarism. Diocletian
used to sit upon his throne
at Nicomedia, watching the death-pangs
of his Christian subjects who
were being burned, not singly, but
in great crowds. Many officers
and servants of his household perished,
and, to distinguish them from
the rest, they were dropped into
the sea with large stones fastened
about their necks. A special object
of the persecutors was to destroy
the churches and tombs of
earlier martyrs, to seize the vessels
used in the Holy Sacrifice, and to
burn the liturgical books and the
Holy Scriptures. The <cite>Roman
Martyrology</cite> makes a particular
mention on the 2d of January of
those who suffered death rather
than deliver up these books to the
tyrant. Although innumerable copies
of the Scriptures perished, not
a few were saved, and new copies
multiplied either by favor of the
less stringent executors of the law,
or because the privilege was bought
by the faithful at a great price.
Some years ago the German Biblical
critic Tischendorf discovered
on Mount Sinai a Greek codex of
extraordinary antiquity and only
two removes from an original of
Origen. It is connected with one
of the celebrated martyrs of this
persecution, and bears upon what
we have just said of the Sacred
Scriptures. In this codex, at the
end of the Book of Esther, there is
a note attesting that the copy was
collated with a very ancient manuscript
that had itself been corrected
by the hand of the blessed martyr
Pamphilus, priest of Cæsarea
in Palestine, while in prison, assisted
by Antoninus, his fellow-prisoner,
who read for him from a copy of
the Hexapla of Origen, which had
been revised by that author himself.
The touching spectacle of
these two men, both of whom gave
their blood for the faith, occupied,
in the midst of the inconveniences,
pain, and weariness of captivity, in
transcribing good copies of the
Bible, is one of the many instances,
discovered in every age, showing
the care that the church has had to
multiply and guard from error the
holy written Word of God.</p>

<p>Among the petty sources of annoyance
during this persecution,
was the difficulty of procuring food,
drink, or raiment that had not been
offered to idols; for the pagan
priests had set up statues of their
divinities in all the market-places,
hostelries, and shops, and at the
private and public fountains. They
used also to go around city and
country sprinkling with superstitious
lustral water the gardens,
vineyards, orchards, and fields, so
as to put the Christians to the greatest
straits to obtain anything that
had not been polluted in this
manner. We learn from the Acts
of S. Theodotus, a Christian tradesman
of Ancyra, the obstacles he
had to surmount at this time to
procure pure bread and wine to be
used by the priests in the Mass.
We can appreciate the intense severity
of this persecution in many
ways; but one of the most singular
proofs of it is that pagans in Spain
inscribed upon a marble monument,
erected in Diocletian’s honor, <em>that
he had abolished the very name of
Christian</em>. This emperor had also
the rare but unenviable privilege
of giving his name to a new chronological
period, called by the pagans,
in compliment to his bloody
zeal for their rites, the Era of Diocletian;
but the Christians called it
the Era of the Martyrs. It began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
on the 29th of August, 284, and was
long in use in Egypt and Abyssinia.
Some of the more renowned victims
of this persecution are Sebastian,
an imperial officer; Agnes, a Roman
virgin; Lucy, a virgin of Syracuse,
and the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to note
briefly the chief causes of so much
cruel bloodshed, even under princes
of undoubted moderation in the
general government of affairs, as
were Trajan, Marcus Aurelius,
Antoninus the Pious, and a few
others.</p>

<p>The most continual, if not the
deepest, source of persecution were
the passions of the populace. Calumny
of the subtlest and most popular
kind, and pressed at all times
with patient effort, had so inflamed
the minds of the brutal lower classes
that only a word or a sign was
required to set them upon the
Christians. These were called disloyal
to the empire, unfriendly to
the princes, of a foreign religion,
people who refused to fall into
the ways of the majority, and enemies
of the human race. From
the remains of ancient histories,
from the Acts of martyrs, from pagan
inscriptions, and from other
sources, more than fifty-seven different
opprobrious qualifications, applied
to the Christians as a body,
have been counted up. But when
particular calumnies became any
way stale, the Christians could always
be accused as the cause of
every calamity that befell the state;
so that, in the words of Tertullian
(<cite>Apol. xl.</cite>), “If the Tiber exceeded
its limits, if the Nile did not rise to
irrigate the fields, if the rain failed
to fall, if the earth quaked, if famine
or pestilence scourged the land, at
once the cry was raised, Christians
to the lions!”</p>

<p>The next most constant source
of trouble was the pernicious influence
of the Philosophers&mdash;a set of
men who pretended to be seekers
after wisdom, and distinguished
themselves from the vulgar by a
certain style of dress. Puffed up
as they were with their own knowledge,
nothing irritated their pride
so much as that men of the despised
Christian class should presume
to dispute their doctrines and teach
that profane philosophy was naught,
since man could not be made perfect
by human wisdom, but only by
the testimony of Christ who was
crucified. Among the Christians,
too, a special order of men whom
we call Apologists, and among whom
we count Justin, Tertullian, Tatian,
Arnobius, Minutius Felix, Origen,
Aristides, Quadratus, Athenagoras,
and Miltiades the chief, exposed in
their eloquent writings the vanity,
contradictions, and vices of their
opponents, succeeding sometimes
in silencing false accusations, and
even in arresting the course of persecution.
Their apologies and memorials
form one of the most instructive
branches of early Christian
literature, and are a considerable
compensation for the loss of so
many Acts of martyrs and other
venerable documents destroyed by
the pagans or which have otherwise
perished.</p>

<p>The third great cause of persecution
was found (to use a comparatively
modern word) in the Erastianism
of the Roman Empire.
The emperor was, by right of the
purple, high-pontiff, and no religion
was recognized that did not profess
its existence and authority dependent
upon the state. Naturally, a
religion whose followers would
reply to every iniquitous command,
“We ought to obey God rather
than men,” could expect no mercy,
but only continual war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes the Christians were
put to death in the same manner
as the common malefactors, such
as by decapitation, crucifixion, or
scourging; sometimes in the manner
reserved for particular classes
of criminals, as being hurled down
a precipice, drowned, devoured by
wild beasts, left to starve. But
sometimes, also, the exquisite cruelty
of the persecutors delighted to
feed upon the sufferings of its victims,
and make dying as long and
painful as possible. Thus, there
are innumerable examples of Christians
being flayed alive, the skin
being neatly cut off in long strips,
and pepper or vinegar rubbed into
the raw flesh; or slowly crushed
between two large stones; or having
molten lead poured down the
throat. Some Christians were tied
to stakes in the ground and gored
to death by wild bulls, or thinly
smeared with honey and exposed
under a broiling sun to the insects
which would be attracted; some
were tied to the tails of vicious
horses and dragged to pieces
some were sewed up in sacks with
vipers, scorpions, or other venomous
things, and thrown into the water;
some had their members violently
torn from the trunk of the
body; some were tortured by fire
in ways almost unknown to the
most savage Indians of America;
some were slowly scourged to
death with whips made of several
bronze chainlets, at the extremity
of each of which was a jagged bullet;
while jerking out of the
teeth in slow succession; cutting
off the nose, ears, lips, and breasts;
tearing of the flesh with hot pincers;
sticking sharp sticks up under
the finger-nails; being held suspended,
head downward, over a
smoking fire; stretching upon a
rack, and breaking upon the wheel,
were some only of the commonest
tortures that preceded the final
death-stroke by sword or lance.
Many instruments used in tormenting
the martyrs have been found
at different times, and are now
carefully preserved in collections
of Christian antiquities; and from
these, from early-written descriptions,
and from the rude representations
on the tombs of martyrs in
the Catacombs, it is known positively
that over one hundred different
modes of torture were used
upon the Christians.</p>

<p>From the earliest period particular
pains were taken by the pastors
of the church to have the remains
of the martyrs collected and some
account of their sufferings consigned
to letters; and Pope S. Clement,
a disciple of the Apostle Peter,
instituted a college of notaries, one
for each of the seven ecclesiastical
districts into which he had divided
Rome, with the special charge of
collecting with diligence all the information
possible about the martyrs.
They were not to pass over
even the minutest circumstances of
their confession of faith and death.
This attendance on the last moments
of the martyrs was often accompanied
by great personal risk,
or at least a heavy expense in the
way of buying the good-will of
venal officers; but it was a thing
of the utmost importance, in view
of the church’s doctrine concerning
the veneration and invocation
of saints, that nothing should
be left undone which prudence
would suggest to leave it beyond
a doubt that the martyrs had confessed
the <em>true</em> faith, and had suffered
death <em>for</em> the faith. The pagans
soon discovered the value that was
set upon such documents, and very
many of them were seized and destroyed.
The fact that the Act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
of the martyrs were objects of
careful search is so well attested&mdash;as
is also the other fact, that an
immense number perished&mdash;that it
is a wonder and a grace of divine
Providence how any, however few
comparatively, have come down to
us. It has been calculated that at
least five million Christians&mdash;men,
women, and children&mdash;were put to
death for the faith during the first
three centuries of the church.</p>

<p>The French historian Ampère
has very justly remarked that
amidst the moral decay of the Roman
Empire, when all else was
lust and despotism, the Christians
alone saved the dignity of human
nature; and the Spaniard Balmes,
when treating of the progress of
individuality under the influence of
Catholicity (<cite>European Civilization</cite>,
ch. xxiii.), remarks that it was the
martyrs who first gave the great
example of proclaiming that “the
individual should cease to acknowledge
power when power exacts
from him what he believes to be
contrary to his conscience.” The
patience of the martyrs rebuked
the sensualism of the pagans; and
their fearless assertions that matters
of conscience are beyond the
jurisdiction of any civil ruler proved
them to be the best friends of
human liberty; while their constancy
and number during three
hundred years of persecution, that
only ceased with their triumph, is
one of the solid arguments to prove
that the Catholic Church has a divine
origin, and a sustaining divinity
within her.</p>

<h3>DURATION.</h3>

<p>Time and duration are usually
considered synonymous, as no duration
is perceived by us, except
the duration of movement, or of
such things as are subject to movement;
and such duration is time.
But, rigorously speaking, time and
duration are not synonymous; for
they are to one another in the same
relation as place and space. As
no place is possible without real
absolute space, so no time is possible
without real absolute duration;
and as place consists of intervals in
space, so time consists of intervals
in duration. Yet there may be
duration independently of time, just
as there may be space independent
of places; and for this reason the
nature of duration must be determined
apart from the nature of
time. In treating of this subject
we shall have to answer a series of
questions altogether similar to those
which we have answered in treating
of space and place. Hence we
shall follow the same order and
method in our present treatise
which we have followed in our
articles on space, with this difference,
however: that, to avoid useless
repetitions, we will omit the development
of some of those reasonings
which the reader himself can easily
transfer from space to duration.</p>

<p>Duration is commonly defined as
“the permanence of a being in its
actuality”&mdash;<i lang="la">Permanentia rei in esse</i>.
The duration of a being which perseveres
in existence without any intrinsic
change is called “standing
duration”&mdash;<i lang="la">Duratio stans</i>. The duration
of a being which is actually
subject to intrinsic mutations is
called “flowing duration”&mdash;<i lang="la">Duratio
fluens</i>.</p>

<p>Flowing duration evidently implies
succession, and succession involves
time; for succession is a relation
between something which
follows and something which precedes.
On the other hand, time
also involves succession; whence it
would seem that neither time nor
succession can be defined apart
from one another, the definition of
the latter presupposing that of the
former, and that of the former presupposing
the notion of the latter.
Although we need not be anxious
about this point (for time and succession
really involve one another,
and therefore may well be included
under the same definition), we must
observe that the notion of succession,
though ordinarily applied to
duration, extends to other things
also whenever they follow one another
in a certain order. Thus the
crust of the earth is formed by a
succession of strata, the Alps by a
succession of mountains, the streets
of the city by a succession of houses,
etc. Hence the notion of succession
is more general than the notion
of time, and consequently there
must be some means of defining it
independently of the consideration
of time.</p>

<p>Balmes explains succession, without
mentioning time, in the following
manner: “There are things
which exclude one another from
the same subject, and there are
other things which do not exclude
one another from the same subject.
The existence of those things which
exclude one another implies succession.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Take a line <i>ABC</i>. A
body placed in <i>A</i> cannot pass over
to the place <i>B</i> without ceasing to
be in <i>A</i>, because the situation <i>B</i>
excludes the situation <i>A</i>, and in a
similar manner the situation <i>C</i> excludes
the situation <i>B</i>. If, then,
notwithstanding this mutual exclusion,
the three places are really occupied
by the same body, there is
succession. This shows that succession
is really nothing else than
<em>the existence of such things as exclude
one another</em>. Hence succession implies
the existence of the thing that
excludes, and the non-existence of
the things that are excluded. All
variations involve some such exclusion;
hence all variations involve
succession.… To perceive the
existence of things which exclude
one another is to perceive succession
and time; to measure it is to
measure time.” Thus far Balmes.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>But, if the <em>flowing</em> duration can
be easily conceived as the existence
of such things as exclude one another,
the case is very different
with regard to <em>standing</em> duration.
For, since we measure all duration
by time or by successive intervals,
we can scarcely conceive that there
may be duration without succession.
Even the word “permanence”
which we employ in the
definition of duration, and which
seems to exclude all notion of
change, is always associated in our
thought with succession and time.
The difficulty we experience in
forming a concept of standing duration
is as great at least as that
which we find in conceiving absolute
space without formal extension
and parts. In fact, formal extension
is to absolute space what formal
succession is to absolute standing
duration. To get over this difficulty
we shall have to show that
there is a duration altogether independent
of contingent changes,
as there is a space altogether independent
of existing bodies, and
that the succession which we observe
in the duration of created
things is not to be found in the
fundamental reason of its existence,
as our imagination suggests, but
only in the changes themselves
which we witness in created things.</p>

<p>The following questions are to
be answered: Is there any standing
duration? and if so, is it an objective
reality, or a mere negation
of movement? Is standing duration
anything created? What sort
of reality is it? Is it modified by
the existence of creatures? What
is a term of duration? What is
relative duration? What is an interval
of duration, and how is it
measured? These questions are
all parallel to those which we have
answered in our first and second
articles on space, and they admit
of a similar solution.</p>

<p><i>First question.</i>&mdash;“Is there any duration
absolutely standing?” Certainly.
For if there is a being
whose entity remains always the
same without any intrinsic change,
its duration will be absolutely
standing. But there is such a
being. For there is, as we have
proved, an infinite reality absolutely
immovable and unchangeable&mdash;that
is, absolute space. Its permanence
is therefore altogether exempt
from succession; and consequently
its duration is absolutely
standing.</p>

<p>Again: As there is no movement
in space without immovable
space, so there is no flowing in duration
without standing duration.
For as a thing cannot change its
ubication in space unless there be
a field for real ubications between
the initial and the final term of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the movement, so a thing cannot
change its mode of being (the
<em>when</em>) in duration, unless there
be a field for real modes of
being between the initial and the
final term of its duration. Now,
this real field, owing to the fact
that it is, in both cases, prerequired
for the possibility of the respective
changes, is something necessarily
anterior to, and independent of, any
of such changes. Therefore, as
the field of all local movements is
anterior to all movements and excludes
movement from itself, so also
the field of all successive durations
is anterior to all successivity and
therefore excludes succession.</p>

<p>Although these two arguments
suffice to establish our conclusion,
what we have to say concerning the
next question will furnish additional
evidence in its support.</p>

<p><i>Second question.</i>&mdash;“Is standing
duration an objective reality or a
mere abstract conception?” We
answer that standing duration is
an objective reality as much as
absolute space. For, as movement
cannot extend in space, if space is
nothing real, so movement cannot
extend in duration, if the field of its
extension is nothing real. But we
have just seen that the field through
which the duration of movement
extends is standing duration.
Therefore standing duration is an
objective reality.</p>

<p>Secondly, a mere nothing, or a
mere fiction, cannot be the foundation
of real relations. But standing
duration is the foundation of all intervals
of real succession, which
are real relations. Therefore standing
duration is not a fiction, but an
objective reality. The major of
this argument is well known. The
minor is proved thus: In all real
relations the terms must communicate
with each other through one and
the same reality; and therefore the
foundation of a real relation must
reach by one and the same reality
the terms related. But the terms
of successive duration are <em>before</em>
and <em>after</em>. Therefore the foundation
of their relation must reach
both <em>before</em> and <em>after</em> with one and
the same reality, and therefore it
has neither <em>before</em> nor <em>after</em> in itself.
Had it <em>before</em> and <em>after</em> in itself, its
<em>after</em> would not be its <em>before</em>; and
thus the reality by which it would
reach the terms of succession would
not be the same. It is therefore
manifest that the foundation of all
real intervals of succession is a
reality whose duration ranges above
succession.</p>

<p>This proof may be presented
more concisely as follows: Succession
is a relation between two
terms, as <em>past</em> and <em>present</em>. Its
foundation must therefore reach all
the past as it reaches the present.
But what reaches the past as well
as the present, is always present;
for if it were past, it would be no
more, and thus it could not reach
the past and the present. Therefore
the foundation of succession
has no past, but only an invariable
present. Therefore there is a real
standing duration, a real field, over
which successive duration extends.</p>

<p>Thirdly, in all intervals of succession
the <em>before</em> is connected
with the <em>after</em> through real duration.
But this real duration has in itself
neither <em>before</em> nor <em>after</em>. For if it
had <em>before</em> and <em>after</em>, it would fall
under the very genus of relation of
which it is the foundation; which
is evidently impossible, because it
would then be the foundation of its
own entity. It is therefore plain that
the real connection between the
<em>before</em> and the <em>after</em> is made by a
reality which transcends all <em>before</em>
and all <em>after</em>, and which is nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
else than absolute standing duration.</p>

<p>Fourthly, if standing duration were
not an objective reality, but a mere
fiction or a mere negation of movement,
there would be no real length
of duration. For the terms of
successive duration are indivisible,
and consequently they cannot give
rise to any continuous quantity of
duration, unless something lies between
them which affords a real
ground for continuous extension.
That the terms of successive duration
are indivisible is evident,
because the same term cannot be
before itself nor after itself, but is
wholly confined to an indivisible
instant. Now, that according to
which an interval of successive
duration can be extended from one
of these terms to another, is nothing
but absolute and standing duration.
For, if it were flowing, it would
pass away with the passing terms,
and thus it would not lie between
them, as is necessary in order to
supply a ground for the extension
of the interval intercepted. In the
same manner, therefore, as there
cannot be distance between two
ubicated points without real absolute
space, there cannot be an interval
between two terms in succession
without real absolute duration.</p>

<p>A fifth proof of the same truth
may be drawn from the reality of
the past. Historical facts are real
facts, although they are all past.
There really was a man called Solomon,
who really reigned in Jerusalem;
there really was a philosopher
called Plato, whose sublime
doctrines deserved for him the surname
of Divine; there really was a
man called Attila, surnamed the
Scourge of God. These men existed
in different intervals of duration,
and they are no more; but
their past existence and their distinct
duration constitute three distinct
facts, which are <em>real facts</em>
even to the present day, and such
will remain for ever. Now, how
can we admit that what has wholly
ceased to exist in successive duration
is still a real and indelible
fact, unless we admit that there is
an absolute duration which is, even
now, as truly united with the past
as it is with the present, and to
which the past is not past, but perpetually
present? If there is no
such duration, then all the past
must have been obliterated and
buried in absolute nothingness; for
if the succession of past things extended
upon itself alone, without
any distinct ground upon which its
flowing could be registered, none
of past things could have left behind
a real mark of their existence.</p>

<p>Against this conclusion some will
object that the relation between <em>before</em>
and <em>after</em> may be explained by
a mere negation of simultaneous
existence. But the objection is
futile. For the intervals of successive
duration can be greater or
less, whilst no negation can be
greater or less; which shows that
the negation of simultaneous existence
must not be confounded with
the intervals of succession.</p>

<p>The following objection is more
plausible. The duration of movement
suffices to fill up the whole
interval of succession and to measure
its extent; and therefore the
reality which connects the <em>before</em>
with the <em>after</em> is movement itself,
not standing duration. To this we
answer that the duration of movement
is essentially successive and
relative; and therefore it requires
a real foundation in something
standing and absolute. In fact, although
every movement formally
extends and measures its own duration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
nevertheless it does not extend
it upon itself, but upon a field
extrinsic to itself; and this field is
permanently the same. It is plain
that the beginning and the end of
movement cannot be connected
in mutual relation through movement
alone, because movement is
always <i lang="la">in fieri</i>, and when it passes
through one term of its duration
it loses the actuality it had in the
preceding term; so that, when it
reaches its last term, it has nothing
left of what it possessed in its initial
term or in any other subsequent
term. This suffices to show
that, although the duration of the
movement fills up the whole interval,
yet, owing to its very successivity,
it cannot be assumed as the
ground of the relation intervening
between its successive terms.</p>

<p><i>Third question.</i>&mdash;“Is absolute and
standing duration a created or an
uncreated reality?” This question
is easily answered; for, in the first
place, standing duration is the duration
of a being altogether unchangeable;
and nothing unchangeable
is created. Hence standing
duration is an uncreated reality.
On the other hand, all that is created
is changeable and constantly
subject to movement; hence all
created (that is, contingent) duration
implies succession. Therefore
standing duration is not to be found
among created realities. Lastly,
standing duration, as involving in
itself all conceivable past and all
possible future, is infinite, and, as
forming the ground of all contingent
actualities, is nothing less
than the formal possibility of infinite
terms of real successive duration.
But such a possibility can
be found in God alone. Therefore
the reality of standing duration is
in God alone; and we need not
add that it must be uncreated.</p>

<p><i>Fourth question.</i>&mdash;“What reality,
then, is absolute standing duration?”
We answer that this duration
is the infinite virtuality or extrinsic
terminability of God’s eternity.
For nowhere but in God’s
eternity can we find the reason of
the possibility of infinite terms and
intervals of duration. Of course,
God’s eternity, considered absolutely
<i lang="la">ad intra</i>, is nothing else than the
immobility of God’s existence; but
its virtual comprehension of all
possible terms of successive duration
constitutes the absolute duration
of God’s existence, inasmuch
as the word “duration” expresses
a virtual extent corresponding to
all possible contingent duration;
for God’s duration, though formally
simultaneous, virtually extends beyond
all imaginable terms and
intervals of contingent duration.
Hence standing duration is the
duration of God’s eternity, the first
and fundamental ground of flowing
duration, the infinite range through
which the duration of changeable
things extend. In other words, the
infinite virtuality of God’s eternity,
as equivalent to an infinite length
of time, is <em>duration</em>; and as excluding
from itself all intrinsic change,
is <em>standing</em> duration. This virtuality
of God’s eternity is really nothing
else than its extrinsic terminability;
for eternity is conceived to
correspond to all possible differences
of time only inasmuch as it
can be compared with the contingent
terms by which it can be extrinsically
terminated.</p>

<p>Secondly, if nothing had been
created, there would have been no
extrinsic terms capable of extending
successive duration; but, since
God would have remained in his
eternity, there would have remained
the reality in which all extrinsic
terms of duration have their virtual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
being; and thus there would
have remained, eminently and without
formal succession, in God himself
the duration of all the beings
possible outside of God. For he
would certainly not have ceased to
exist in all the instants of duration
in which creatures have existed;
the only change would have been
this: that those instants, owing to a
total absence of creatures, would
have lacked their formal denomination
of <em>instants</em>, and their formal
successivity. Hence, if nothing
had been created, there would
have remained infinite real duration
without succession, simply because
the virtuality of God’s eternity
would have remained in all its
perfection. It is therefore this virtuality
that formally constitutes
standing duration.</p>

<p>From this the reader will easily
understand that in the concept of
standing duration two notions are
involved, viz.: that of <em>eternity</em>, as
expressing the standing, and that
of its <em>virtuality</em>, as connoting virtual
extent. In fact, God’s eternity,
absolutely considered, is simply
the actuality of God’s substance,
and, as such, does not connote
duration; for God’s substance is
not said <em>to endure</em>, but simply <em>to
be</em>. The formal reason of duration
is derived from the extrinsic terminability
of God’s eternity; for the
word “duration” conveys the idea
of continuation, and continuation
implies succession. Hence it is
on account of its extrinsic terminability
to successive terms of duration
that God’s eternity is conceived
as equivalent to infinite succession;
for what virtually contains
in itself all possible terms
and intervals of succession virtually
contains in itself all succession,
and can co exist, without intrinsic
change, with all the changes of
contingent duration. Balmes, after
defining succession as the existence
of such things as exclude one another,
very properly remarks: “If
there were a being which neither
excluded any other being nor were
excluded by any of them, that being
would co-exist with all beings.
Now, one such being exists, viz.:
God, and God alone. Hence theologians
do but express a great
and profound truth when they say
(though not all, perhaps, fully understand
what they say) that God
is present to all times; that to him
there is no succession, no <em>before</em> or
<em>after</em>; that to him everything is
present, is <em>Now</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>We conclude that standing duration
is infinite, all-simultaneous, independent
of all contingent things,
indivisible, immovable, formally
simple and unextended, but equivalent
to infinite intervals of successive
duration, and virtually extending
through infinite lengths. This
duration is absolute.</p>

<p><i>Fifth question.</i>&mdash;“Does the creation
of a contingent being in absolute
duration cause any intrinsic
change in standing duration?”
The answer is not doubtful; for
we have already seen that standing
duration is incapable of intrinsic
modifications. Nevertheless, it will
not be superfluous to remark, for
the better understanding of this
answer, that the “when” (the <i lang="la">quando</i>)
of a contingent being has the
same relation to the virtuality of
God’s eternity as has its “where”
(the <i lang="la">ubi</i>) to the virtuality of God’s
immensity. For, as the “where”
of every possible creature is virtually
precontained in absolute
space, so is the “when” of all
creatures virtually precontained in
absolute duration. Hence the creation
of any number of contingent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
beings in duration implies nothing
but the <em>extrinsic</em> termination of absolute
duration, which accordingly
remains altogether unaffected by
the existence in it of any number
of extrinsic terms. The “when”
of a contingent being, as contained
in absolute duration, is virtual; it
does not become formal except in
the contingent being itself&mdash;that is,
by extrinsic termination. Thus the
subject of the contingent “when”
is not the virtuality of God’s eternity
any more than the subject of
the contingent “where” is the virtuality
of God’s immensity.</p>

<p>This shows that the formal
“when” of a contingent being is
a mere relativity, or a <i lang="la">respectus</i>.
The formal reason, or the foundation,
of this relativity is the reality
through which the contingent being
communicates with absolute standing
duration, viz.: the real instant
(<i lang="la">quando</i>) which is common to both,
although not in the same manner;
for it is <em>virtual</em> in standing duration,
whilst it is <em>formal</em> in the extrinsic
term. Hence a contingent
being, inasmuch as it has existence
in standing duration, is nothing
but a term related by its “when”
to divine eternity as existing in a
more perfect manner in the same
“when.” But, since the contingent
“when” of the creature exclusively
belongs to the creature itself,
God’s standing duration receives
nothing from it except a relative
extrinsic denomination.</p>

<p>The relation resulting from the
existence of a created term in
standing duration consists in this:
that the created term by its formal
“when” really imitates the eminent
mode of being of God himself in
the same “when.” This relation is
called <em>simultaneousness</em>.</p>

<p>Simultaneousness is often confounded
with presence and with
co-existence. But these three notions,
rigorously speaking, differ
from one another. <em>Presence</em> refers
to terms in space; <em>simultaneousness</em>
to terms in duration; <em>co-existence</em>
to terms both present and simultaneous.
Thus presence and simultaneousness
are the constituents of
co-existence. Presence is to be
considered as the material constituent,
because it depends on the
“where,” which belongs to the
thing on account of its matter or
potency; simultaneousness must be
considered as the formal constituent,
because it depends on the “when,”
which belongs to the thing on account
of its act or of its resulting
actuality.</p>

<p>Before we proceed further, we
must yet remark that in the same
manner as the infinite virtuality of
divine immensity receives distinct
extrinsic denominations from the
contingent terms existing in space,
and is thus said to imply <em>distinct
virtualities</em>, so also the infinite virtuality
of God’s eternity can be
said to imply distinct virtualities,
owing to the distinct denominations
it receives from distinct terms of
contingent duration. It is for this
reason that we can speak of virtualities
of eternity in the plural.
Thus when we point out the first
instant of any movement as distinct
from any following instant, we consider
the flowing of the contingent
“when” from <em>before</em> to <em>after</em> as a
passage from one to another virtuality
of standing duration. These
virtualities, however, are not distinct
as to their absolute beings, but
only as to their extrinsic termination
and denomination; and therefore
they are really but one infinite
virtuality. As all that we have
said of the virtualities of absolute
space in one of our past articles
equally applies to the virtualities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
of absolute duration, we need not
dwell here any longer on this
point.</p>

<p><i>Sixth question.</i>&mdash;“In what does
the ‘when’ of a contingent being
precisely consist?” From the preceding
considerations it is evident
that the “when” of a contingent
being may be understood in two
manners, viz., either <em>objectively</em> or
<em>subjectively</em>. Objectively considered,
the “when” is nothing else
than <em>a simple and indivisible term in
duration</em> formally marked out in it
by the actuality of the contingent
being. We say <em>a simple and indivisible
term</em>, because the actuality of
the contingent being by which it is
determined involves neither past
nor future, neither <em>before</em> nor <em>after</em>,
but only its present existence, which,
as such, is confined to an indivisible
<em>Now</em>. Hence we do not agree with
those philosophers who confound
the <i lang="la">quando</i> with the <i lang="la">tempus</i>&mdash;that is,
the “when” with the extent of
flowing duration. We admit with
these philosophers that the “when”
of contingent things extends through
movement from <em>before</em> to <em>after</em>, and
draws, so to say, a continuous line
in duration; but we must remind
them that the <em>before</em> and the <em>after</em>
are distinct modes of being in duration,
and that every term of duration
designable between them is a
distinct “when” independent of
every other “when,” either preceding
or following; which shows
that the <i lang="la">tempus</i> implies an uninterrupted
series of distinct “whens,”
and therefore cannot be considered
as synonymous with <i lang="la">quando</i>.</p>

<p>If the “when” is considered subjectively&mdash;that
is, as an appurtenance
of the subject of which it is
predicated&mdash;it may be defined as
<em>the mode of being of a contingent thing
in duration</em>. This mode consists
of a mere relativity; for it results
from the extrinsic termination of
absolute duration, as already explained.
Hence the “when” is
not <em>received</em> in the subject of which
it is predicated, and does not <em>inhere</em>
in it, but, like all other relativities
and connotations, simply connects
it with its correlative, and intervenes
or lies between the one and
the other.</p>

<p>But, although it consists of a
mere relativity, the “when” still
admits of being divided into <em>absolute</em>
and <em>relative</em>, according as it is conceived
absolutely as something real
in nature, or compared with some
other “when”; for, as we have already
explained when treating of
ubications, relative entities may be
considered both as to what they are
in themselves, and as to what they
are to one another.</p>

<p>If the “when” is considered
simply as a termination of standing
duration, without regard for anything
else, it is called <em>absolute</em>, and
is defined as <em>the mode of being of a
thing in absolute duration</em>. This
absolute “when” is an <em>essential
mode</em> of the contingent being no less
than its dependence from the first
cause, and is altogether immutable
so long as the contingent being
exists; for, on the one hand, the
contingent being cannot exist but
within the domain of divine eternity,
and, on the other, it cannot have
different modes of being with regard
to it, as the standing duration of
eternity is all uniform in its infinite
virtual extension, and the contingent
being, however much we may
try to vary its place in duration,
must always be in the very middle
of eternity. Hence the absolute
“when” is altogether unchangeable.</p>

<p>If the “when” of a contingent
being is compared with that of
another contingent being in order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
to ascertain their mutual relation,
then the “when” is called <em>relative</em>,
and, as such, it may be defined
as <em>the mode of terminating a relation
in duration</em>. This “when” is
changeable, not in its intrinsic entity,
but in its relative formality; and
it is only under this formality that
the “when” (<i lang="la">quando</i>) can be ranked
among the predicamental accidents;
for this changeable formality
is the only thing in it which
bears the stamp of an accidental
entity.</p>

<p>The <em>before</em> and the <em>after</em> of the
same contingent being are considered
as two distinct relative terms,
because the being to which they
refer, when existing in the <em>after</em>,
excludes the <em>before</em>; though the
absolute “when” of one and the
same being is one term only. But
of this we shall treat more fully in
the sequel.</p>

<p><i>Seventh question.</i>&mdash;“What is relative
duration?” Here we meet again
the same difficulty which we have
encountered in explaining relative
space; for in the same manner as
relations in space are usually confounded
with space itself, so are the
intervals in duration confounded
with the duration which is the
ground of their extension. But, as
the reasonings by which we have
established the precise notion of
relative space can be easily brought
to bear on the present subject by
the reader himself, we think we
must confine ourselves to a brief
and clear statement of the conclusions
drawn from those reasonings,
as applied to duration.</p>

<p>Relative duration is <em>the duration
through which any movement extends</em>;
that is, the duration through which
the “when” of anything in movement
glides from <em>before</em> to <em>after</em>,
and by which the <em>before</em> and the
<em>after</em> are linked in mutual relation.
Now, the duration through which
movement extends is not exactly
the duration of the movement itself,
but the ground upon which the
movement extends its own duration;
because movement has nothing
actual but a flowing instant,
and therefore it has no duration
within itself except by reference to
an extrinsic ground through which
it successively extends. This
ground, as we have already shown,
is standing duration. And therefore
relative duration is nothing
else than <em>standing duration as
extrinsically terminated by distinct
terms</em>, or, what amounts to the same
terminated by one term which, owing
to any kind of movement, acquires
distinct and opposite formalities.
This conclusion is based on
the principle that the foundation
of all relations between <em>before</em>
and <em>after</em> must be something absolute,
having in itself neither <em>before</em>
nor <em>after</em>, and therefore absolutely
standing. This principle is obviously
true. The popular notion,
on the contrary, that relative duration
is the duration of movement,
is based on the assumption that
movement itself engenders duration&mdash;which
assumption is false;
for we cannot even conceive movement
without presupposing the absolute
duration upon which the
movement has to trace the line of
its flowing existence.</p>

<p>Thus relative duration is called
relative, not because it is itself related,
but because it is the ground
through which the extrinsic terms
are related. It is actively, not passively,
relative; it is the <i lang="la">ratio</i>, not
the <i lang="la">rationatum</i>, the foundation, not
the result, of the relativities. In
other terms, relative duration is absolute
as to its entity, and relative
as to the extrinsic denomination
derived from the relations of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
it is the formal reason. Duration,
as absolute, may be styled “the
region of all possible <em>whens</em>,” just
as absolute space is styled “the region
of all possible ubications”;
and, as relative, it may be styled
“the region of all possible succession,”
just as relative space is styled
“the region of all local movements.”
Absolute standing duration
and absolute space are the
ground of the <em>here</em> and <em>now</em> as
statical terms. Relative standing
duration and relative space are the
ground of the <em>here</em> and <em>now</em> as gliding&mdash;that
is, as dynamically considered.</p>

<p><i>Eighth question.</i>&mdash;“What is an interval
of duration?” It is a relation
existing between two opposite
terms of succession&mdash;that is, between
<em>before</em> and <em>after</em>. An interval
of duration is commonly considered
as a continuous extension;
yet it is primarily a simple relation
by which the extension of the
flowing from <em>before</em> to <em>after</em> is formally
determined. Nevertheless,
since the “when” cannot acquire
the opposite formalities, <em>before</em>
and <em>after</em>, without continuous
movement, all interval of duration
implies movement, and therefore
may be considered also as a continuous
quantity. Under this last
aspect, the interval of duration is
nothing else than the duration of
the movement from <em>before</em> to <em>after</em>.</p>

<p>We have already noticed that the
duration of movement, or the interval
of duration, is not to be confounded
with the duration through
which the movement extends. But
as, in the popular language, the one
as well as the other is termed
“relative duration,” we would suggest
that the duration through
which the movement extends might
be called <em>fundamental</em> relative duration,
whilst the relation which constitutes
an interval between <em>before</em>
and <em>after</em> might be called <em>resultant</em>
relative duration.</p>

<p>The philosophical necessity of
this distinction is obvious, first, because
the <em>standing</em> duration, through
which movement extends, must not
be confounded with the <em>flowing</em> duration
of movement; secondly, because
the relation and its foundation
are not the same thing, and, as
we have explained at length when
treating of relative space, to confound
the one with the other leads
to Pantheism. Intervals of relation
are not <em>parts</em> of absolute duration,
though they are so conceived
by many, but they are mere relations,
as we have stated. Absolute
duration is all standing, it has no
parts, and it cannot be divided into
parts. What is called an interval
<em>of</em> duration should rather be called
an interval <em>in</em> duration; for it is
not a portion of standing duration,
but an extrinsic result; it is not a
length of absolute duration, but
the length of the movement extending
through that duration; it is not a
divisible extension, but the ground
on which movement acquires its
divisible extension from <em>before</em> to
<em>after</em>. In the smallest conceivable
interval of duration there is God,
with all his eternity. To affirm
that intervals of duration are distinct
durations would be to cut
God’s eternity to pieces by giving
it a distinct being in really distinct
intervals. Hence it is necessary to
concede that, whilst the intervals
are distinct, the duration on which
they have their foundation is one
and the same. The only duration
which can be safely confounded
with those intervals is the flowing
duration of the movement by which
they are measured. This is the
duration which can be considered
as a continuous quantity divisible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
into parts; and this is the duration
which we should style “<em>resultant</em>
relative duration,” to avoid all danger
of error or equivocation.</p>

<p>The objections which can be
made against this manner of viewing
things do not much differ from
those which we have solved in our
second article on space; and therefore
we do not think it necessary
to make a new answer to them.
The reader himself will be able to
see what the objections are, and
how they can be solved, by simply
substituting the words “eternity,”
“duration,” etc., for the words “immensity,”
“space,” etc., in the article
referred to.</p>

<p>Yet a special objection can be
made against the preceding doctrine
about the duration of movement,
independently of those which
regard relations in space. It may
be presented under this form.
“The foundation of the relation
between <em>before</em> and <em>after</em> is nothing
else than movement itself. It is
therefore unnecessary and unphilosophical
to trace the duration of
movement to the virtuality of God’s
eternity as its extrinsic foundation.”
The antecedent of this argument
may be proved thus:
“That thing is the foundation of
the relation which gives to its
terms their relative being&mdash;that is,
in our case, their opposite formalities,
<em>before</em> and <em>after</em>. But movement
alone gives to the <em>when</em> these
opposite formalities. Therefore
movement alone is the foundation
of successive duration.”</p>

<p>We answer that the antecedent
of the first argument is absolutely
false. As to the syllogism which
comes next, we concede the major,
but we deny the minor. For it is
plain that movement cannot give
to the absolute <em>when</em> the relative
formalities <em>before</em> and <em>after</em>, except
by flowing through absolute duration,
without which it is impossible
for the movement to have its successive
duration. And surely, if
the movement has no duration but
that which it borrows from the absolute
duration through which it
extends, the foundation of its duration
from <em>before</em> to <em>after</em> can be
nothing else than the same absolute
duration through which the movement
acquires its <em>before</em> and <em>after</em>.
Now, this absolute duration is the
virtuality of God’s eternity, as we
have proved. It is therefore both
philosophical and necessary to trace
the duration of movement to the
virtuality of God’s eternity, as its
extrinsic foundation. That movement
is also necessary to constitute
the relation between <em>before</em> and
<em>after</em>, we fully admit; for there
cannot be <em>before</em> and <em>after</em> without
movement. But it does not follow
from this that movement is the
<em>foundation</em> of the relation; it merely
follows that movement is a <em>condition</em>
necessary to give to the absolute
<em>when</em> two distinct actualities,
according to which it may be compared
with itself on the ground of
standing duration. For, as every
relation demands two opposite
terms, the same absolute <em>when</em> must
acquire two opposite formalities,
that it may be related to itself.</p>

<p>The only other objection which
may perhaps be made against our
conclusions is the following: The
foundation of a real relation is that
reality through which the terms related
communicate with one another.
Now, evidently, the <em>before</em>
and the <em>after</em>, which are the terms
of the relation in question, communicate
with one another through
the same absolute <em>when</em>; for they
are the same absolute <em>when</em> under
two opposite formalities. Hence
it follows that the foundation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the relation between <em>before</em> and <em>after</em>
is nothing else than the absolute
<em>when</em> of a moving being.</p>

<p>To this we answer that the foundation
of the relation is not all
reality through which the terms related
communicate with one another,
but only that reality by the
common termination of which they
become formally related to one another.
Hence, since the <em>before</em> and
the <em>after</em> do not receive their relative
formalities from the absolute
<em>when</em>, it is idle to pretend that the
absolute <em>when</em> is the foundation of
the interval of duration. The <em>before</em>
and the <em>after</em> communicate with the
same absolute <em>when</em> not as a formal,
but as a material, cause of their existence&mdash;that
is, inasmuch as the
same <em>when</em> is the subject, not the
reason, of both formalities. The
only relation to which the absolute
<em>when</em> can give a foundation is one
of identity with itself in all the extent
of its flowing duration. But
such a relation presupposes, instead
of constituting, an interval
in duration. And therefore it is
manifest that the absolute <em>when</em> is
not the foundation of the relation
between <em>before</em> and <em>after</em>.</p>

<p>Having thus answered the questions
proposed, and given the solution
of the few difficulties objected,
we must now say a few words about
the <em>division</em> and <em>measurement</em> of relative
duration, whether fundamental
or resultant.</p>

<p>Fundamental or standing duration
is divided into <em>real</em> and <em>imaginary</em>.
This division cannot regard
the entity of standing duration,
which is unquestionably real, as we
have proved. It regards the reality
or the unreality of the extrinsic
terms conceived as having a relation
in duration. The true notion
of real, contrasted with imaginary,
duration, is the following: Standing
duration is called <em>real</em> when it
is <em>really</em> relative, viz., when it is extrinsically
terminated by real terms
between which it founds a real relation;
on the contrary, it is called
<em>imaginary</em> when the extrinsic terms
do not exist in nature, but only in
our imagination; for, in such a case,
standing duration is not really terminated
and does not found real
relations, but both the terminations
and the relations are simply a figment
of our imagination. Thus
standing duration, as containing
none but imaginary relations, may
justly be called “imaginary,”
though in an absolute sense it is
intrinsically real. Accordingly,
the <em>indefinite</em> duration which we
imagine when we carry our thought
beyond the creation of the world,
and which is also called “imaginary,”
is not absolute but relative
duration, and is not imaginary in
itself, but only as to its denomination
of relative, because, in the absence
of all real terms, there can be
none but imaginary relations.</p>

<p>It is therefore unphilosophical
to confound imaginary and indefinite
duration with absolute and infinite
duration. This latter is not
an object of imagination, but of
the intellect alone. Imagination
cannot conceive duration, except in
connection with some movement
from <em>before</em> to <em>after</em>; hence absolute
and infinite duration, which has
no <em>before</em> and no <em>after</em>, is altogether
beyond the reach of imagination.
Indeed, our intellectual conception
of infinite standing duration is
always accompanied in our minds
by a representation of indefinite
time; but this depends, as we have
stated in speaking of space, on the
well-known connection of our imaginative
and intellectual operations,
inasmuch as our imagination
strives to follow the intellect, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
to represent after its own manner
what the intellect conceives in a
totally different manner. It was
by confounding the objective notion
of duration with our subjective
manner of imagining it that
Kant came to the conclusion that
duration was nothing but a subjective
form or a subjective condition,
under which all intuitions are possible
in us. This conclusion is
evidently false; but its refutation,
to be successful, must be based on
the objectivity of absolute standing
duration, without which, as we
have shown, there can be no field
for real and objective succession.</p>

<p>Resultant relative duration&mdash;that
is, an interval of flowing duration&mdash;admits
of the same division into
<em>real</em> and <em>imaginary</em>. It is real
when a real continuous flowing connects
the <em>before</em> with the <em>after</em>; in
all other suppositions it will be imaginary.
It may be remarked that
the “real continuous flowing” may
be either intrinsic or extrinsic.
Thus, if God had created nothing
but a simple angel, there would have
been no other flowing duration than
a continuous succession of intellectual
operations connecting the <em>before</em>
with the <em>after</em> in the angel himself,
and thus his duration would
have been measured by a series of intrinsic
changes. It is evident that in
this case one absolute <em>when</em> suffices
to extend the interval of duration;
for by its gliding from <em>before</em> to <em>after</em>
it acquires opposite formalities
through which it can be relatively
opposed to itself as the subject and
the term of the relation. If, on the
contrary, we consider the interval
of duration between two distinct
beings&mdash;say Cæsar and Napoleon&mdash;then
the real continuous flowing
by which such an interval is measured
is extrinsic to the terms compared;
for the <em>when</em> of Cæsar is
distinct from, and does not reach,
that of Napoleon; which shows that
their respective <em>whens</em> have no intrinsic
connection, and that the
succession comprised between those
<em>whens</em> must have consisted of a
series of changes extrinsic to the
terms compared. It may seem difficult
to conceive how an interval
of continuous succession can result
between two terms of which the
one does not attain to the other;
for, as a line in space must be
drawn by the movement of a single
point, so it seems that a length in
duration must be extended by the
flowing of a single <em>when</em> from <em>before</em>
to <em>after</em>. The truth is that the interval
between the <em>whens</em> of two
distinct beings is not obtained by
comparing the <em>when</em> of the one
with that of the other, but by resorting
to the <em>when</em> of some other
being which has extended its continuous
succession from the one
to the other. Thus, when Cæsar
died, the earth was revolving on
its axis, and it continued to revolve
without interruption up to the existence
of Napoleon, thus extending
the duration of its movement
from a <em>when</em> corresponding to
Cæsar’s death to a <em>when</em> corresponding
to Napoleon’s birth; and
this duration, wholly extrinsic to
Cæsar and Napoleon, measures the
interval between them.</p>

<p>As all intervals of duration extend
from <em>before</em> to <em>after</em>, there can
be no interval between co-existent
beings, as is evident. In the same
manner as two beings whose ubications
coincide cannot be distant in
space, so two beings whose <em>whens</em>
are simultaneous cannot form an
interval of duration.</p>

<p>All real intervals of duration regard
the past; for in the past alone
can we find a real <em>before</em> and a real
<em>after</em>. The present gives no interval,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
as we have just stated, but
only simultaneousness. The future
is real only potentially&mdash;that is, it
will be real, but it is not yet.
What has never been, and never
will be, is merely imaginary. To
this last class belong all the intervals
of duration corresponding to
those conditional events which did
not happen, owing to the non-fulfilment
of the conditions on which
their reality depended.</p>

<p>As to the measurement of flowing
duration a few words will suffice.
The <em>when</em> considered absolutely
is incapable of measuring an
interval of duration, for the reason
that the <em>when</em> is unextended, and
therefore unproportionate to the
mensuration of a continuous interval;
for the measure must be of
the same kind with the thing to be
measured. Just as a continuous
line cannot be made up of unextended
points, so cannot a continuous
interval be made up of indivisible
instants; hence, as a line is divisible
only into smaller and smaller
lines, by which it can be measured,
so also an interval of duration
is divisible only into smaller and
smaller intervals, and is measured
by the same. These smaller intervals,
being continuous, are themselves
divisible and mensurable by
other intervals of less duration, and
these other intervals are again divisible
and mensurable; so that,
from the nature of the thing, it is
impossible to reach an absolute
measure of duration, and we must
rest satisfied with a relative one,
just as in the case of a line and
of any other continuous quantity.
The smallest unit or measure of
duration commonly used is the second,
or sixtieth part of a minute.</p>

<p>But, since continuous quantities
are divisible <i lang="la">in infinitum</i>, it may be
asked, what prevents us from considering
a finite interval of duration
as containing an infinite multitude
of infinitesimal units of duration?
If nothing prevents us, then in the
infinitesimal unit we shall have the
true and absolute measure of duration.
We answer that nothing prevents
such a conception; but the
mensuration of a finite interval by
infinitesimal units would never supply
us the means of determining
the relative lengths of two intervals
of duration. For, if every interval
is a sum of infinite terms, and is so
represented, how can we decide
which of those intervals is the
greater, since we cannot count the
infinite?</p>

<p>Mathematicians, in all dynamical
questions, express the conditions of
the movement in terms of infinitesimal
quantities, and consider every
actual instant which connects the
<em>before</em> with the <em>after</em> as an infinitesimal
interval of duration in the
same manner as they consider every
shifting ubication as an infinitesimal
interval of space. But when
they pass from infinitesimal to finite
quantities by integration between
determinate limits, they do not express
the finite intervals in infinitesimal
terms, but in terms of a finite
unit, viz., a second of time; and
this shows that, even in high mathematics,
the infinitesimal is not taken
as the measure of the finite.</p>

<p>Since infinitesimals are considered
as evanescent quantities, the
question may be asked whether
they are still conceivable as quantities.
We have no intention of discussing
here the philosophical
grounds of infinitesimal calculus, as
we may have hereafter a better opportunity
of examining such an interesting
subject; but, so far as infinitesimals
of duration are concerned,
we answer that they are still
quantities, though they bear no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
comparison with finite duration.
What mathematicians call an infinitesimal
of time is nothing else
rigorously than the flowing of an
actual “when” from <em>before</em> to <em>after</em>.
The “when” as such is no quantity,
but its flowing is. However narrow
the compass within which it
may be reduced, the flowing implies
a relation between <em>before</em> and <em>after</em>;
hence every instant of successive
duration, inasmuch as it actually
links its immediate <em>before</em> with its
immediate <em>after</em>, partakes of the nature
of successive duration, and
therefore of continuous quantity.
Nor does it matter that infinitesimals
are called <em>evanescent</em> quantities.
They indeed vanish, as compared
with finite quantities; but the very
fact of their vanishing proves that
they are still something when they
are in the act of vanishing. Sir
Isaac Newton, after saying in his
<cite>Principia</cite> that he intends to reduce
the demonstration of a series of
propositions to the first and last
sums and ratios of nascent and evanescent
quantities, propounds and
solves this very difficulty as follows:
“Perhaps it may be objected
that there is no ultimate proportion
of evanescent quantities;
because the proportion, before the
quantities have vanished, is not
the ultimate, and, when they are
vanished, is none. But by the
same argument it may be alleged
that a body arriving at a certain
place, and there stopping, has no
ultimate velocity; because the velocity,
before the body comes to the
place, is not its ultimate velocity;
when it has arrived, is none. But
the answer is easy; for by the ultimate
velocity is meant that with
which the body is moved, neither
<em>before</em> it arrives at its last place and
the motion ceases, nor <em>after</em>, but
at the <em>very instant</em> it arrives; that
is, the velocity with which the
body arrives at its last place, and
with which the motion ceases. And
in like manner, by the ultimate
ratio of evanescent quantities is to
be understood the ratio of the
quantities, not before they vanish,
not afterwards, but with which they
vanish. In like manner, the first
ratio of nascent quantities is that
with which they begin to be.”
From this answer, which is so clear
and so deep, it is manifest that
infinitesimals are real quantities.
Whence we infer that every instant
of duration which actually flows
from <em>before</em> to <em>after</em> marks out a
real infinitesimal interval of duration
that might serve as a unit of
measure for the mensuration of all
finite intervals of succession, were
it not that we cannot reckon up to
infinity. Nevertheless, it does not
follow that an infinitesimal duration
is an absolute unit of duration; for
it is still continuous, even in its infinite
smallness; and accordingly it
is still divisible and mensurable by
other units of a lower standard.
Thus it is clear that the measurement
of flowing duration, and indeed of
all other continuous quantity, cannot
be made except by some arbitrary
and conventional unit.</p>

<h3>WILLIAM TELL AND ALTORF.</h3>

<p>Brunnen, the “fort of Schwytz,”
standing at that angle of the lake
of Lucerne where it turns abruptly
towards the very heart of the
Alps, has always been a central
halting-place for travellers; but
since the erection of its large hotel
the attraction has greatly increased.
We found the Waldstätterhof full
to overflowing, and rejoiced that,
as usual, we had wisely ordered our
rooms beforehand. Our surprise
was great, as we threaded the mazes
of the <i lang="fr">table-d’hôte</i> room, to see Herr
H&mdash;&mdash; come forward and greet us
cordially. We expected, it is true,
to meet him here, but not until the
eve of the feast at Einsiedeln,
whither he had promised to accompany
us. An unforeseen event,
however, had brought him up the
lake sooner, and he therefore came
on to Brunnen, in the hope of finding
us. A few minutes sufficed to
make him quit his place at the
centre table and join us at a small
one, where supper had been prepared
for our party, and allow us
to begin a description of our wanderings
since we parted from him
on the quay at Lucerne. Yes,
“begin” is the proper word; for before
long the harmony was marred
by George, who, with his usual impetuosity,
and in spite of Caroline’s
warning frowns and Anna’s and my
appealing looks, betrayed our disappointment
at having missed the
Hermitage at Ranft, and the reproaches
we had heaped on Herr
H&mdash;&mdash;’s head for having mismanaged
the programme in that particular.
The cheery little man, whose
eyes had just begun to glisten with
delight, grew troubled.</p>

<p>“I am <em>so</em> sorry!” he exclaimed.
“But the ladies were not so enthusiastic
about Blessed Nicholas when
I saw them. And as for you,
Mr. George, I never could have
dreamt you would have cared for
the Hermit.”</p>

<p>“Oh! but <em>he</em> is a real historical
character, you see, about whom
there can be no doubt&mdash;very unlike
your sun-god, your mythical
hero, William Tell!” replied
George.</p>

<p>“Take care! take care! young
gentleman,” said Herr H&mdash;&mdash;, laughing.
“Remember you are now in
Tell’s territory, and he may make
you rue the consequences of deriding
him! Don’t imagine, either,
that your modern historical critics
have left even Blessed Nicholas
alone! Oh! dear, no.”</p>

<p>“But he is vouched for by documents,”
retorted George.“No one
can doubt them.”</p>

<p>“Your critics of this age would
turn and twist and doubt anything,”
said Herr H&mdash;&mdash;. “They
cannot deny his existence nor the
main features of his life; yet some
have gone so far as to pretend to
doubt the most authentic fact in
it&mdash;his presence at the Diet of
Stanz&mdash;saying that <em>probably</em> he
never went there, but only wrote
a letter to the deputies. So much
for their criticism and researches!
After that specimen you need not
wonder that I have no respect for
them. But I am in an unusually
patriotic mood to-day; for I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
just come from a meeting at Beckenried,
on the opposite shore, in
Unterwalden. It was that which
brought me here before my appointment
with you. It was a
meeting of one of our Catholic societies
in these cantons, which assembled
to protest against the revision
of the constitution contemplated
next spring. Before separating
it was suggested that they
should call a larger one at the
Rütli, to evoke the memories of
the past and conform themselves to
the pattern of our forefathers.”</p>

<p>“Why do you so much object to
a revision?” inquired Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;.
“Surely reform must sometimes be
necessary.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes, of course, but not
at present, my dear sir. ‘Revision’
nowadays simply means radicalism
and the suppression of our religion
and our religious rights and
privileges. It is a word which, for
that reason alone, is at all times distasteful
to these cantons. Moreover,
it savors too much of French
ideas and doctrines, thoroughly
antagonistic to all our principles
and feelings. Everything French
is loathed in these parts, especially
in Unterwalden, in spite of&mdash;or I
should perhaps rather say in consequence
of&mdash;all they suffered from
that nation in 1798.”</p>

<p>“I can understand that,” said
Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;, “with the memory of the
massacre in the church at Stanz
always in their minds.”</p>

<p>“Well, yes; but that was only
one act in the tragedy. The desolation
they caused in that part of
the country was fearful. Above
all, their total want of religion at
that period can never be forgotten.”</p>

<p>“As for myself,” remarked Mr.
C&mdash;&mdash;, “though not a Catholic, I
confess that I should much rather
rely on the upright instincts of this
pious population than on the crooked
teachings of our modern philosophers.
I have always noticed
in every great political crisis that
the instincts of the pure and simple-minded
have something of an
inspiration about them; they go
straight to the true principles where
a Macchiavelli is often at fault.”
Herr H&mdash;&mdash; completely agreed with
him, and the conversation soon became
a deep and serious discussion
on the tendencies of modern politics
in general, so that it was late
that evening before our party separated.</p>

<p>The first sound that fell upon
my ear next morning was the
splashing of a steamer hard by.
It had been so dark upon our arrival
the night before that we had
not altogether realized the close
proximity of the hotel to the lake,
and it was an unexpected pleasure
to find my balcony almost directly
over the water, like the stern gallery
of a ship of war. A small
steamer certainly was approaching
from the upper end of the lake,
with a time-honored old diligence
in the bows and a few travellers,
tired-looking and dust-stained,
scattered on the deck, very unlike
the brilliant throngs that pass to
and fro during the late hours of
the day. But this early morning
performance was one of real business,
and the magical words “Post”
and “St. Gothard,” which stood out
in large letters on the yellow panels
of the diligence, told at once of
more than mere pleasure-seeking.
What joy or grief, happiness or despair,
might not this old-fashioned
vehicle be at this moment conveying
to unknown thousands! It
was an abrupt transition, too, to be
thus brought from pastoral Sarnen
and Sachslen into immediate contact
with the mighty Alps. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
their grandeur, however, nothing
could be seen; for, without rain or
wind, a thick cloud lay low upon
the lake, more like a large flat ceiling
than aught else. Yet, for us, it
had its own peculiar interest, being
nothing more nor less than the
great, heavy, soft mass which we
had noticed hanging over the lake
every morning when looking down
from Kaltbad, whilst we, revelling
in sunshine and brightness above,
were pitying the poor inhabitants
along the shore beneath. There
was a kind of superiority, therefore,
in knowing what it meant, and
in feeling confident that it would
not last long. And, as we expected,
it did clear away whilst we sat
at our little breakfast-table in the
window, revealing in all its magnificence
the glorious view from
this point up the Bay of Uri,
which we have elsewhere described.
Huge mountains seemed to rise
vertically up out of the green waters;
verdant patches were dotted
here and there on their rugged
sides; and, overtopping all, shone
the glacier of the Urirothstock,
more dazzlingly white and transparent
than we had ever yet beheld it.</p>

<p>“Now, ladies!” exclaimed Herr
H&mdash;&mdash;, “I hope you have your
Schiller ready; for the Rütli is yonder,
though you will see it better by
and by.”</p>

<p>“Why, I thought you disapproved
of Schiller,” retorted the irrepressibly
argumentative George.</p>

<p>“To a certain degree, no doubt,”
replied Herr H&mdash;&mdash;. “But nothing
can be finer than his <cite>William Tell</cite>
as a whole. My quarrel with it is
that the real William Tell would
have fared much better were it not
for this play, and especially for the
opera. They have both made the
subject so common&mdash;so <i lang="fr">banale</i>,
as the French say&mdash;that the world
has grown tired of it, and for this
reason alone is predisposed to reject
our hero. Besides, the real
history of the Revolution is so fine
that I prefer it in its simplicity.
Schiller is certainly true to its spirit,
but details are frequently different.
For instance, the taking of
the Castle of the Rossberg, which
you passed on the lake of Alpnach:
Schiller has converted that into a
most sensational scene, whereas the
true story is far more characteristic.
That was the place where a
young girl admitted her betrothed
and his twelve Confederate friends
by a rope-ladder at night, which
enabled them to seize the castle
and imprison the garrison “without
shedding a drop of blood or
injuring the property of the Habsburgs,”
in exact conformity with
their oath on the Rütli. You will
often read of the loves of Jägeli
and Ameli in Swiss poetry. They
are great favorites, and, in my opinion,
far more beautiful than the fictitious
romance of Rudenz and
Bertha. And so in many other
cases. But every one does not object
to Schiller as I do; for in 1859,
when his centenary was celebrated
in Germany, the Swiss held a festival
here on the Rütli, and subsequently
erected a tablet on that
large natural pyramidal rock you
see at the corner opposite. It is
called the Wytenstein, and you can
read the large gilt words with a
glass. It is laconic enough, too;
see: ‘To Frederick Schiller&mdash;The
Singer of Tell&mdash;The Urcantone.’
The original cantons! Miss
Caroline! let me congratulate
you on being at last in the ‘Urschweiz’&mdash;the
cradle of Switzerland,”
continued Herr H&mdash;&mdash;, as
we sauntered out on the quay,
pointing at the same time to some
bad frescos of Swen and Suiter on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
warehouse close by. Stauffacher,
Fürst, and Van der Halden also figured
on the walls&mdash;the presiding
geniuses of this region. “Brunnen
is in no way to be despised, I
assure you, ladies; you are treading
on venerated soil. This is the very
spot that witnessed the foundation
of the Confederacy, where the oath
was taken by the representatives of
Uri, Schwytz, and Unterwalden the
day after the battle of Morgarten.
They swore ‘to die, each for all
and all for each’&mdash;the oath which
made Switzerland renowned, and
gave the name of ‘Ridsgenossen,’
or ‘oath-participators,’ to its inhabitants.
The document is still kept
in the archives at Schwytz, with
another dated August 1, 1291.
Aloys von Reding raised his standard
against the French here in 1798;
and he was quite right in beginning
his resistance to them at Brunnen.
It is full of memories to us
Swiss, and is a most central point,
as you may see, between all these
cantons. The increase in the hotels
tells what a favorite region it
also is with tourists.”</p>

<p>On this point Mr. and Mrs.
C&mdash;&mdash;’s astonishment was unbounded.
They had passed a fortnight
at Brunnen in 1861, at a small inn
with scanty accommodation, now
replaced by the large and comfortable
Waldstätterhof, situated in one
of the most lovely spots imaginable,
at the angle of the lake, one
side fronting the Bay of Uri and
the other looking up towards
Mount Pilatus. The <i lang="fr">pension</i> of
Seelisberg existed on the heights
opposite even then&mdash;only, however,
as a small house, instead of the present
extensive establishment, with
its pretty woods and walks; but
Axenstein and the second large
hotel now building near it, with
the splendid road leading up to
them, had not been thought of.
The only communication by land
between Schwytz and Fluelen, in
those days, was a mule-path along
the hills, precipitous and dangerous
in many parts. The now famed
Axenstrasse was not undertaken
until 1862; and is said to have been
suggested by the French war in
Italy. With the old Swiss dread
of the French still at heart, the
Federal government took alarm at
that first military undertaking on
the part of Napoleon III., and, seeing
the evil of having no communication
between these cantons in
case of attack, at once took the
matter seriously in hand. This
great engineering achievement was
opened to the public in 1868. It
looked most inviting to-day, and we
quickly decided to make use of it
by driving along it to Fluelen, and
thence to Altorf, returning in the
evening by the steamer. Some
were anxious to visit the Rütli; but
Mr. and Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash; had been there
before, and knew that it was more
than an hour’s expedition by boat,
so that the two excursions on the
same day would be quite impossible;
consequently, we chose the
longer one.</p>

<p>It was just ten o’clock when we
started; Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash;, Caroline,
Herr H&mdash;&mdash;, and myself in one carriage,
with George on the box, the
others following us in a second vehicle.
We had not proceeded far
when Herr H&mdash;&mdash; made us halt to
look at the Rütli, on the shore
right opposite. We distinctly saw
that it was a small meadow, formed
by earth fallen from above on a
ledge of rock under the precipitous
heights of Seelisberg, and now
enclosed by some fine chestnut and
walnut trees. Truly, it was a spot
fitted for the famous scene. So unapproachable
is it, except by water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
that even that most enterprising
race&mdash;Swiss hotel-keepers&mdash;have
hitherto failed to destroy it. Some
years ago, however, it narrowly escaped
this fate; for Herr Müller, of
Seelisberg, is said to have been on
the point of building a <i lang="fr">pension</i> on
the great meadow. But no sooner
did this become known than a national
subscription was at once
raised, the government purchased
it, and now it has become inalienable
national property for ever.</p>

<p>“You may well be proud of your
country, Herr H&mdash;&mdash;,” exclaimed
Mr. C&mdash;&mdash; from the other carriage.
“I always look on that tiny spot
with deep reverence as the true
cradle of freedom. Look at it well,
George! It witnessed that wonderful
oath by which these mountaineers
bound themselves ‘to be
faithful to each other, just and
merciful to their oppressors’&mdash;the
only known example of men&mdash;and
these men peasants, too&mdash;binding
themselves, in the excitement of
revolt, not to take revenge on their
oppressors.”</p>

<p>“Quite sublime!” ejaculated
George.</p>

<p>“Well, it has borne good fruit,”
returned Herr H&mdash;&mdash; in gleeful
tones; “for here we are still free!
Except on the one occasion of the
French in ’98, no foreign troops
have ever invaded this part of
Switzerland since those days. Yes,
there are three springs at the Rütli,
supposed to have jutted forth where
the three heroes stood; but I do
not pledge my word for that,” he
answered smilingly to Caroline,
“nor for the legend which says
that their spirits sleep in the rocky
vale under Seelisberg, ready to
come forth and lead the people in
moments of danger.”</p>

<p>“I hope their slumbers may
never be disturbed,” she replied;
“but I wish some one would prevent
these cattle from frightening
the horses,” as a large drove swept
past our carriages, making our
steeds nervous. Splendid animals
they were, with beautiful heads,
straight backs, light limbs, and of a
grayish mouse color.</p>

<p>“All of the celebrated Schwytz
breed,” said Herr H&mdash;&mdash;. “This
part of the country is renowned for
its cattle. Each of these probably
cost from five to six hundred francs.
The Italians take great advantage
of this new road, and come in numbers
to buy them at this season,
when the cattle are returning from
the mountains. These are going
across the St. Gothard to Lombardy.
Those of Einsiedeln are still
considered the best. Do you remember,
Miss Caroline, that the
first mention of German authority
in this land was occasioned by a
dispute between the shepherds of
Schwytz and the abbots of Einsiedeln
about their pasturage&mdash;the
emperor having given a grant of
land to the abbey, while the
Schwytzers had never heard of his
existence even, and refused to
obey his majesty’s orders?”</p>

<p>“Ah! what historical animals:
that quite reconciles me to them,”
she answered, as we drove on again
amongst a group that seemed very
uneasy under their new masters,
whose sweet language George averred
had no power over them.</p>

<p>Who can describe the exquisite
beauty of our drive?&mdash;winding in
and out, sometimes through a tunnel;
at others along the edge of the
high precipice from which a low
parapet alone separated us; at another
passing through the village
of Sisikon, which years ago suffered
severely from a fragment of rock
fallen from the Frohnalp above.
Time flew rapidly, and one hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
and a half had glided by, without
our perceiving it, when we drew up
before the beautiful little inn of
“Tell’s Platte.”</p>

<p>“But there is no Platform here,”
cried George. “We are hundreds
of feet above the lake. The critics
are right, Herr H&mdash;&mdash;, decidedly
right! I knew it from the beginning.
How can you deny it?”</p>

<p>“Wait, my young friend! Don’t
be so impatient. Just come into
the inn first&mdash;I should like you to
see the lovely view from it; and
then we can look for the Platform.”
Saying which, he led us upstairs,
on through the <i lang="fr">salon</i> to its balcony
on the first floor. This is one of
the smaller inns of that olden type
which boast the enthusiastic attachment
of regular customers, and display
with pride that old institution&mdash;the
“strangers’ book”&mdash;which has
completely vanished from the monster
hotels. It lay open on the
table as we passed, and every one
instinctively stopped to examine it.</p>

<p>“The dear old books!” exclaimed
Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash;. “How they used to
amuse me in Switzerland! I have
missed them so much this time.
Their running fire of notes, their
polyglot verses&mdash;a sort of album
and scrap-book combined, full, too,
of praise or abuse of the last hotel,
as the humor might be.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;, “I shall
never forget the preface to one&mdash;an
imprecation on whoever might be
tempted to let his pen go beyond
bounds. I learned it by rote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“May the mountain spirits disturb his slumbers;</div>
<div class="verse">May his limbs be weary, and his feet sore;</div>
<div class="verse">May the innkeepers give him tough mutton and</div>
<div class="verse">Sour wine, and charge him for it as though he were</div>
<div class="verse">Lord Sir John, M.P.!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“How very amusing!&mdash;a perfect
gem in its way,” cried Anna. “Lord
Sir John, M.P., must have been the
model of large-pursed Britons in
his time.” Here, however, everything
seemed to be <i lang="fr">couleur de rose</i>.
The book’s only fault was its monotony
of praise. Two sisters keep
the hotel, and “nowhere,” said its
devoted friends, “could one find
better fare, better attendance, and
greater happiness than at Tell’s
Platform.” The testimony of a
young couple confessedly on their
bridal tour had no weight. We
know how, at that moment, a barren
rock transforms itself into a paradise
for them; but three maiden
ladies had passed six weeks of unalloyed
enjoyment here once upon
a time, and had returned often
since; English clergymen and their
families found no words of praise
too strong; while German students
and professors indulged in rhapsodical
language not to be equalled
out of fatherland.</p>

<p>Duchesses, princesses, and Lords
Sir John, M.P., were alone wanting
amongst the present guests. “But
they come,” said Herr H&mdash;&mdash;, “by
the mid-day steamers, dine and rest
here awhile, and return in the evenings
to the larger hotels in other
places.”</p>

<p>And standing on the balcony of
the <i lang="fr">salon</i>, facing all the grand mountains,
with the green lake beneath,
it truly seemed a spot made for
brides and bridegrooms, for love
and friendship. So absorbed were
we in admiration of the enchanting
view that we did not at first notice
two little maidens sitting at the far
end. They were pretty children,
of nine and thirteen, daughters of
an English family stopping here,
and their countenances brightened
as they heard our exclamation of
delight; for Tell’s Platte was to
them a paradise. Like true Britons,
however, they said nothing
until George and Caroline commenced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
disputing about the scenery.
Comment then was irresistible.
“No,” said the youngest,
“that is the Isenthal,” pointing to
a valley beneath the hills opposite;
“and that the Urirothstock, with
its glacier above, and the Gütschen.
Those straight walls of rock below
are the Teufel’s-Münster.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember where
Schiller says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘The blast, rebounding from the Devil’s Minster,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Has driven them back on the great Axenberg’?</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">That is it, and this here is the
Axenberg,” said Emily, the elder
girl.</p>

<p>“But I see no Platform here,”
remarked George with mischief in
his eye, as he quickly detected the
young girl’s faith in the hero.</p>

<p>“It would be impossible to see
it,” she rejoined, “as it is three
hundred feet below this house.”</p>

<p>“But we can show you the way,
if you will come,” continued the
younger child, taking George’s
hand, who, partly from surprise and
partly amusement, allowed himself
to be led like a lamb across the
road and through the garden to
the pathway winding down the
cliff, followed by us, under guidance
of the elder sister, Emily.</p>

<p>“Yes,” the children answered,
“they had spent the last two
years in France and Germany.”
And certainly they spoke both languages
like natives. Emily was
even translating <cite>William Tell</cite> into
English blank verse. “Heigho!”
sighed Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;, “for this precocious
age.” But the lake of the
Forest Cantons was dearer to them
than all else. They had climbed
one thousand feet up the side of the
Frohnalpstock that very morning
with their father; knew every peak
and valley, far and near, with all
their legends and histories; even the
<i lang="fr">ranz des vaches</i> and the differences
between them&mdash;the shepherds’ calls
to the cows and the goats. Annie,
our smaller friend, entertained
George with all their varieties, as
she tripped daintily along, like a little
fairy, with her tiny alpenstock.
Very different was she from continental
children, who rarely, if ever,
take interest in either pastoral or
literary matters. She knew the
way to the platform well; for did
she not go up and down it many
times a day? A difficult descent it
was, too&mdash;almost perpendicular&mdash;notwithstanding
the well-kept pathway;
but not dangerous until we
reached the bottom, when each one
in turn had to jump on to a jutting
piece of rock, in order to get
round the corner into the chapel.
Most truly it stands on a small
ledge, with no inch of room for
aught but the small building raised
over it. The water close up to the
shore is said to be eight hundred feet
deep, and it made one shudder to
hear Herr H&mdash;&mdash;’s story of an artist
who a few years ago fell into the
lake while sketching on the cliffs
above. Poor man! forgetful of the
precipice, he had thoughtlessly
stepped back a few steps to look at
his painting, fell over, and was
never seen again. His easel and
painting alone remained to give pathetic
warning to other rash spirits.</p>

<p>The chapel, open on the side
next the water, is covered with
faded frescos of Tell’s history,
which our little friends quaintly
described; and it contains, besides,
an altar and a small pulpit. Here
Mass is said once a year on the
Friday after the Ascension, when all
the people of the neighborhood
come hither, and from their boats,
grouped outside, hear Mass and
the sermon preached to them from
the railing in front. This was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
feast which my Weggis guide so
much desired to see. It is unique
in every particular, and Herr
H&mdash;&mdash; was eloquent on the beauty
and impressiveness of the scene, at
which he had once been present,
and which it was easy to understand
amidst these magnificent surroundings.
Nor is it a common
gathering of peasants, but a solemn
celebration, to which the authorities
of Uri come in state with the
standard of Uri&mdash;the renowned
Uri ox&mdash;floating at the bows. As
may be supposed, the sermon is
always national, touching on all
those points of faith, honor, and
dignity which constitute true patriotism.
Mr. C&mdash;&mdash; had Murray’s
guide-book in his hand, and would
not allow us to say another word
until he read aloud Sir James Macintosh’s
remarks on this portion of
the lake, which there occur as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The combination of what is grandest
in nature with whatever is pure and
sublime in human conduct affected me
in this passage (along the lake) more
powerfully than any scene which I had
ever seen. Perhaps neither Greece nor
Rome would have had such power over
me. They are dead. The present inhabitants
are a new race, who regard
with little or no feeling the memorials of
former ages. This is, perhaps, the only
place on the globe where deeds of pure
virtue, ancient enough to be venerable,
are consecrated by the religion of the
people, and continue to command interest
and reverence. No local superstition
so beautiful and so moral anywhere
exists. The inhabitants of Thermopylæ
or Marathon know no more of
these famous spots than that they are so
many square feet of earth. England is
too extensive a country to make Runnymede
an object of national affection. In
countries of industry and wealth the
stream of events sweeps away these old remembrances.
The solitude of the Alps
is a sanctuary destined for the monuments
of ancient virtue; Grütli and Tell’s
chapel are as much reverenced by the
Alpine peasants as Mecca by a devout
Mussulman; and the deputies of the
three ancient cantons met, so late as the
year 1715, to renew their allegiance and
their oaths of eternal union.”</p>

</div>

<p>“All very well,” said George,
“if there really had been a Tell;
but this seems to me a body without
a soul. Why, this very chapel
is in the Italian style, and never
could have been founded by the
one hundred and twenty contemporaries
who are said to have
known Tell and to have been
present at its consecration.”</p>

<p>“I never heard that any one insisted
on this being the original
building,” said Herr H&mdash;&mdash;. “It is
probably an improvement on it;
but it was not the fashion in those
times&mdash;for people were not then incredulous&mdash;to
put up tablets recording
changes and renovations,
as nowadays at Kaltbad and
Klösterle, for instance. But speaking
dispassionately, Mr. George,
it seems to me quite impossible
that the introduction of any legend
from Denmark or elsewhere could
have taken such strong hold of a
people like these mountaineers
without some solid foundation, especially
here, where every inhabitant
is known to the other, and
the same families have lived on in
the same spots for centuries. Why
is it not just as likely that the same
sort of event should have occurred
in more than one place? And as
to its not being mentioned in the
local documents, that is not conclusive
either; for we all know
how careless in these respects were
the men of the middle ages, above
all in a rude mountain canton
of this kind. Transmission by
word of mouth and by religious
celebrations is much more in character
with those times. I go heart
and hand with your own Buckle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
who places so much reliance on
local traditions. The main argument
used against the truth of the
story is, you know, that it was first
related in detail by an old chronicler
called Ægidius Tschudi, a
couple of hundred years after the
event. But I see nothing singular
in that; for most probably he
merely committed to writing, with
all the freshness of simplicity, the
story which, for the previous two
hundred years, had been in the
hearts and on the lips of the peasants
of this region. No invention of any
writer could have founded chapels
or have become ingrained in the
hearts of the locality itself in the
manner this story has done. It was
never doubted until the end of the
last century, when a Prof. Freudenberger,
of Bern, wrote a pamphlet
entitled <cite>William Tell: a
Danish Fable</cite>.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” broke in little Emily, latest
translator of Schiller, and who
had been listening attentively to
our discussion, “and the people of
the forest cantons were so indignant
that the authorities of Uri had the
pamphlet burned by the common
hangman, and then they solemnly
proclaimed its author an outlaw.”</p>

<p>“I told you, Mr. George, that you
were on dangerous ground here,”
said Herr H&mdash;&mdash;, laughing.</p>

<p>“I must make him kiss this earth
before he leaves,” said Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash;,
“as I read lately of a mother making
her little son do when passing
here early in this century, regarding
it as a spot sacred to liberty.
She little thought a sceptic like
you would so soon follow.”</p>

<p>“Well! I am <em>almost</em> converted,”
he answered, smiling, “but I wish
Miss Emily would tell us the story
of Tell’s jumping on shore here,”
trying to draw out the enthusiastic
little prodigy.</p>

<p>“Oh! don’t you remember that
magnificent passage in Schiller
where, after the scene of shooting
at the apple, Gessler asked Tell
why he put the second arrow into
his quiver, and then, promising to
spare his life if he revealed its object,
evades his promise the instant
he hears that it was destined to kill
him if Tell had struck his son instead
of the apple? He then ordered
him to be bound and taken
on board his vessel at Fluelen.
The boat had no sooner left Fluelen
than one of those sudden
storms sprang up so common hereabouts.
There was one two days
ago. Annie and I tried to come
down here, but it was impossible&mdash;the
wind and waves were so high
we could not venture, so we sat on
the pathway and read out Schiller.
Oh! he is a great genius. He
never was in Switzerland. Yes!
just fancy that; and yet he describes
everything to perfection.
Well! Tell was as good a pilot as
a marksman, and Gessler, in his
fright, again promised to take off
his fetters if he would steer the
vessel safely. He did, but steered
them straight towards this ledge of
rock, sprang out upon it, climbed
up the cliff, and, rushing through
the country, arrived at the Hohle-Gasse
near Küssnacht before the
tyrant had reached it.”</p>

<p>“Schiller decidedly has his merit,
it must be confessed, when he can
get such ardent admirers as these
pretty children,” said Herr H&mdash;&mdash;
when we bade farewell to our dear
little friends.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the incorrigible
George from the box seat, “poetry,
poetry!&mdash;an excellent mode of
transmitting traditions, making them
indelible on young minds; but I am
so far converted, Herr H&mdash;&mdash;,” continued
he, laughing, “that I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
sorry the doubts were ever raised
about the Tell history. It is in
wonderful keeping with the place
and people, and it will be a great
pity if <em>they</em> give it up. ‘Se non è
vero, è ben trovato,’<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> at least.”</p>

<p>Hence onwards to Fluelen is the
finest portion of the Axenstrasse,
and the opening views of the valley
of the Reuss and the Bristenstock,
through the arches of the galleries
or tunnels, every minute increased
in beauty. Several of us got out
the better to enjoy them, sending
the carriages on ahead. The
Schwytz cattle had quite escaped
our memories, when suddenly a
bell sounded round a sharp angle
of the road and a large drove instantly
followed.</p>

<p>A panic seized us ladies. The
cliff rose vertically on the inner
side, without allowing us the possibility
of a clamber, and in our
fright, before the gentlemen could
prevent us, we leaped over a low
railing, which there served as a parapet,
on to a ledge of rock, a few
yards square, rising straight up
from the lake hundreds of feet below.
All recollection of their historical
interest vanished from our
minds; for, as the cattle danced
along, they looked as scared and
wild as ourselves, and it was not
until they had passed without noticing
us, and that their dark-eyed
masters had spoken some soft Italian
words to us, that we fully realized
the extent of our imprudence.
Had any one of these animals
jumped up over the railing, as we
afterwards heard they have sometimes
done, who can say what
might not have happened? Fortunately,
no harm ensued beyond a
flutter of nerves, which betrayed
itself by Anna’s turning round to a
set of handsome goats that soon
followed the cattle, crying out to
them in her own peculiar German:
“Nix kommen! nix kommen!”</p>

<p>Fluelen has nothing to show beyond
the picturesqueness of a village
situated in such scenery and a
collection of lumbering diligences
and countless carriages, awaiting
the hourly arrival of the steamers
from Lucerne. The knell of these
old diligences, however, has tolled,
for the St. Gothard Railway tunnel
has been commenced near Arnsty,
and though it may require years to
finish it, its “opening day” will
surely come. Half an hour’s drive
up the lovely valley brought us to
Altorf, at the foot of the Grünwald,
which, in accord with its
name, is clothed with a virgin forest,
now called the “Bann forest,”
because so useful is it in protecting
the town from avalanches and landslips
that the Uri government
never permits it to be touched.
Altorf, like so many of the capitals
in these forest cantons, has a small
population, 2,700 inhabitants only,
but it has many good houses, for it
was burnt down in 1799 and rebuilt
in a better manner. Tell’s
story forms its chief interest, and
certainly did so in our eyes. We
rushed at once to the square, where
one fountain is said to mark the
spot where Tell took aim, and another
that upon which his boy
stood. Tradition says that the
latter one replaced the lime-tree
against which the son leant, portions
of which existed until 1567.
A paltry plaster statue of the hero
is in the same square, but the most
remarkable relic of antiquity is an
old tower close by, which Herr
H&mdash;&mdash; assured us is proved by documents
to have been built before
1307, the date of Tell’s history.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Had the young friends we left at
“Tell’s Platform” accompanied us
hither, Emily might have quoted
Schiller to us at length. But
George, having recently bought a
Tauchnitz edition of Freeman’s
<cite>Growth of the English Constitution</cite>,
which opens with a fine description
of the annual elections of this canton,
he earnestly pleaded a prolongation
of our drive to the spot
where this takes place, three miles
further inland. Accordingly, after
ordering dinner to be ready on our
return at a hotel which was filled
with Tell pictures, and an excellent
one of the festival at the Platform,
we left the town and proceeded
up the valley. Soon we
crossed a stream, the same, Herr
H&mdash;&mdash; told us, in which Tell is said
to have been drowned while endeavoring
to save a child who had
fallen into it. He also pointed
out to us Bürglen, his home, and an
old tower believed to have been his
house, attached to which there is
now a small ivy-clad chapel. It
stands at the opening of the Schächen
valley, celebrated to this day
for its fine race of men&mdash;likewise
corresponding in this respect with
the old tradition. But more modern
interest attaches to this valley,
for it was along its craggy sides
and precipices that Suwarow’s army
made its way across the Kinzig-Kulm
to the Muotta. The whole
of this region was the scene of
fearful fighting&mdash;first between the
French and the Austrians, who
were assisted by the natives of Uri,
in 1799, and then, a month later,
between the Russians coming up
from Lombardy and the French.</p>

<p>“That was the age of real
fighting,” said Herr H&mdash;&mdash;, “hand-to-hand
fighting, without <i lang="fr">mitrailleuses</i>
or long ranges. But the
misery it brought this quarter was
not recovered from for years after.
Altorf was burnt down at that
time, and everything laid waste.
The memory of the trouble lingers
about here even yet. What wonder!
Certainly, in all Europe no
more difficult fighting ground
could have been found. In the end,
the French General Lecourbe was
all but cut off, for he had destroyed
every boat on the lake; in those
days a most serious matter, as neither
steamers nor Axenstrasse existed.
When he therefore wished to
pursue the Russians, who by going
up this Schächen valley intended
to join their own corps, supposed
to be at Zürich, he too was obliged
to make a bold manœuvre. And
then it was that he led his army
by torchlight along the dangerous
mule-path on the Axenberg! Sad
and dreadful times they were for
these poor cantons.”</p>

<p>Herr H&mdash;&mdash; showed us Attinghausen,
the birth-place of Walter
Fürst, and the ruins of a castle
near, which is the locality of a fine
scene in Schiller, but the last owner
of which died in 1357, and is
known to have been buried in his
helmet and spurs. Shortly after,
about three miles from Altorf, we
reached the noted field, and George,
opening Freeman, read us the following
passage aloud:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Year by year, on certain spots among
the dales and the mountain-sides of
Switzerland, the traveller who is daring
enough to wander out of beaten tracks
and to make his journey at unusual seasons,
may look on a sight such as no
other corner of the earth can any longer
set before him. He may there gaze and
feel, what none can feel but those who
have seen with their own eyes, what
none can feel in its fulness more than
once in a lifetime&mdash;the thrill of looking
for the first time face to face on freedom
in its purest and most ancient form. He
is there in a land where the oldest institutions
of our race&mdash;institutions which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
may be traced up to the earliest times of
which history or legend gives us any glimmering&mdash;still
live on in their primeval
freshness. He is in a land where an immemorial
freedom, a freedom only less eternal
than the rocks that guard it, puts to
shame the boasted antiquity of kingly
dynasties, which, by its side, seem but as
innovations of yesterday. There, year
by year, on some bright morning of the
springtide, the sovereign people, not entrusting
its rights to a few of its own
number, but discharging them itself in
the majesty of its corporate person,
meets, in the open market-place or in the
green meadow at the mountain’s foot, to
frame the laws to which it yields obedience
as its own work, to choose the
rulers whom it can afford to greet with
reverence as drawing their commission
from itself. Such a sight there are but
few Englishmen who have seen; to be
among these few I reckon among the
highest privileges of my life. Let me
ask you to follow me in spirit to the very
home and birth-place of freedom, to the
land where we need not myth and fable
to add aught to the fresh and gladdening
feeling with which we for the first time
tread the soil and drink in the air of the
immemorial democracy of Uri. It is one
of the opening days of May; it is the
morning of Sunday; for men there deem
that the better the day the better the deed;
they deem that the Creator cannot be
more truly honored than in using in his
fear and in his presence the highest of
the gifts which he has bestowed on man.
But deem not that, because the day of
Christian worship is chosen for the great
yearly assembly of a Christian commonwealth,
the more directly sacred duties
of the day are forgotten. Before we, in
our luxurious island, have lifted ourselves
from our beds, the men of the mountains,
Catholics and Protestants alike,
have already paid the morning’s worship
in God’s temple. They have heard the
Mass of the priest or they have listened
to the sermon of the pastor, before some
of us have awakened to the fact that the
morn of the holy day has come. And
when I saw men thronging the crowded
church, or kneeling, for want of space
within, on the bare ground beside the
open door, when I saw them marching
thence to do the highest duties of men
and citizens, I could hardly forbear
thinking of the saying of Holy Writ,
that ‘where the spirit of the Lord is, there
is liberty.’ From the market-place of
Altorf, the little capital of the canton,
the procession makes its way to the place
of meeting at Bözlingen. First marches
the little army of the canton, an army
whose weapons never can be used save
to drive back an invader from their land.
Over their heads floats the banner, the
bull’s-head of Uri, the ensign which led
men to victory on the fields of Sempach
and Morgarten. And before them all,
on the shoulders of men clad in a garb
of ages past, are borne the famous horns,
the spoils of the wild bull of ancient
days, the very horns whose blast struck
such dread into the fearless heart of
Charles of Burgundy. Then, with their
lictors before them, come the magistrates
of the commonwealth on horseback, the
chief-magistrate, the Landamman, with
his sword by his side. The people follow
the chiefs whom they have chosen
to the place of meeting, a circle in a
green meadow, with a pine forest rising
above their heads, and a mighty spur of
the mountain range facing them on the
other side of the valley. The multitude
of freemen take their seats around the
chief ruler of the commonwealth, whose
term of office comes that day to an end.
The assembly opens; a short space is
given to prayer&mdash;silent prayer offered
up by each man in the temple of God’s
own rearing. Then comes the business
of the day. If changes in the law
are demanded, they are then laid before
the vote of the assembly, in which
each citizen of full age has an equal
vote and an equal right of speech.
The yearly magistrates have now discharged
all their duties; their term of
office is at an end; the trust that has
been placed in their hands falls back
into the hands of those by whom it was
given&mdash;into the hands of the sovereign
people. The chief of the commonwealth,
now such no longer, leaves his seat of
office, and takes his place as a simple
citizen in the ranks of his fellows. It
rests with the free-will of the assembly
to call him back to his chair of office, or
to set another there in his stead. Men
who have neither looked into the history
of the past, nor yet troubled themselves
to learn what happens year by year in
their own age, are fond of declaiming
against the caprice and ingratitude of
the people, and of telling us that under
a democratic government neither men
nor measures can remain for an hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
unchanged. The witness alike of the
present and of the past is an answer to
baseless theories like these. The spirit
which made democratic Athens year by
year bestow her highest offices on the
patrician Pericles and the reactionary
Phocion, still lives in the democracies
of Switzerland, alike in the Landesgemeinde
of Uri and in the Federal Assembly
at Bern. The ministers of kings,
whether despotic or constitutional, may
vainly envy the sure tenure of office which
falls to the lot of those who are chosen
to rule by the voice of the people. Alike
in the whole confederation and in the
single canton, re-election is the rule; the
rejection of the outgoing magistrate is
the rare exception. The Landamman
of Uri, whom his countrymen have
raised to the seat of honor, and who has
done nothing to lose their confidence,
need not fear that when he has gone to
the place of meeting in the pomp of office,
his place in the march homeward
will be transferred to another against his
will.”</p>

<p>The grand forms of the Windgälle,
the Bristenstock, and the other
mighty mountains, surrounded us
as we stood in deep silence on this
high green meadow, profoundly impressed
by this eloquent tribute to
a devout and liberty-loving people,
all the more remarkable as coming
from a Protestant writer. There
was little to add to it, for Herr
H&mdash;&mdash;’s experience could only
confirm it in every point. Dinner
had to be got through rapidly on
our return to Altorf, as we wished
to catch the steamer leaving Fluelen
at five o’clock. Like all these
vessels, it touched at the landing-place
beside Tell’s Platform,
whence our young friends of the
morning, who had been watching
for our return, waved us a greeting.
Thence we sat on deck, tracing Lecourbe’s
mule-path march of torch-light
memory along the Axenberg
precipices, and finally reached the
Waldstätterhof at Brunnen in time
to see the sun sink behind Mont
Pilatus, and leave the varied outlines
clearly defined against a deep-red
sky.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Troubles of Our Catholic Forefathers,
related by Themselves.</span>
Second Series. Edited by John Morris,
S. J. London: Burns &amp; Oates.
1875. (New York: Sold by The Catholic
Publication Society.)</p>

</div>

<p>Whilst our ears are deafened and our
feelings shocked by the calumnies and
lying vituperation heaped upon all that
is most worthy of love and veneration
upon earth by the Satanic societies which
the Popes have smitten with repeated excommunications,
it is consoling to be supplied&mdash;by
limners, too, who are themselves
no mean exemplars of the noble
development which the Church can give
to virtue when it follows her counsels&mdash;with
lifelike portraits of Christian athletes
in times gone by. We do not know
how soon our courage, patience, and
charity may be put to a similar test.
Multitudes of our fellow-Catholics are
already subjected to every suffering but
the martyrdom of death; and this seed of
the Church our enemies, more wily than
the sanguinary heretics of the age of
Elizabeth, seem to be unwilling to sow.
But they will not long be able to restrain
their passion. The word of persecution
has gone forth; and so bitter is the hatred
of the very name of Christ, that before
very long nothing but the blood of Christians
will satiate its instincts.</p>

<p>The persecution of the Church in England
in the time of Elizabeth resembled
the persecution which is now raging
against it, in the political complexion
given to it. But there were far stronger
grounds for it then than now. The superior
claims of Mary to the throne, her
virtues, and her surpassing beauty, were
a just subject of jealousy and uneasiness
to Elizabeth, and she might very naturally
suppose that her Catholic subjects were
not likely to regard with any fondness the
usurpation of an illegitimate daughter of
her apostate and tyrannical father.</p>

<p>In the present persecutions there is no
political pretext, but one is made under
cover of which to extirpate from among
mankind the religion and very name of
Christ.</p>

<p>This volume is the second of a series
which promises to supply us with a whole
gallery of Christian heroes, which we of
this age of worldliness, cowardice, and
self-seeking will do well to study attentively.
As is often the case, it is to the untiring
zeal of the Society of Jesus we owe
so interesting as well as edifying a work.
Father Morris, formerly Secretary to
Cardinal Wiseman, but who joined the
Society after the death of that eminent
prelate, is its author, and he appears to
us to have executed his task with rare
judgment. By allowing his characters
to speak in great part for themselves,
the biographies and relations he presents
us with have a dramatic interest which is
greatly increased by the quaint and nervous
style of the time in which they express
themselves. We feel, too, that it is
the very innermost soul and mind of the
individual that is being revealed to us;
and certainly in most of them the revelation
is so beautiful that we should possibly
have ascribed something of this to the
partiality of a panegyrist, or to his descriptive
skill, if the picture had been
sketched by the pen of any other biographer
than themselves. It is, indeed, the
mean opinion they evidently have of
themselves, and the naïve and modest
manner in which they relate incidents
evoking heroic virtue, their absolute unconsciousness
of aught more than the
most ordinary qualities, which fascinate
us. It bears an impress of genuineness
impossible to any description by the most
impartial of historians. They express a
beauty which could no more be communicated
in any other way than can the
odor of the flower or the music of the
streams be conveyed by any touch, how
ever magic, of the painter.</p>

<p>The present volume of the series contains
the “Life of Father William Weston,
S.J.,” and “The Fall of Anthony
Tyrrell,” by Father Persons; for “our
wish is,” says Father Morris, “to learn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
not only what was done by the strong
and brave, but also by the weak and cowardly.”</p>

<p>We are much struck in this history with
the resemblance between those times and
the present in the unsparing calumny of
which the purest and the holiest men
were made the victims.</p>

<p>For confirmation of these remarks, we
refer the reader to the book itself. But
we cannot refrain from quoting, in spite
of its length, the following incident related
by Father Weston. It is a remarkable
example of the salutary effect of the
Sacrament of Penance:</p>

<p>“For there lay in a certain heretical
house a Catholic who, with the consent
of his keeper, had come to London for the
completion of some urgent business. He
had been committed to a prison in the
country, a good way out of London. He
was seized, however, and overpowered by
a long sickness which brought him near
to death. The woman who nursed him,
being a Catholic, had diligently searched
the whole city through to find a priest,
but in vain. She then sent word to me
of the peril of that person, and entreated
me, if it could be contrived, to come to
his assistance, as he was almost giving
up the ghost. I went to him when the
little piece of gold obtained for me the
liberty to do so. I explained that I was
a priest, for I was dressed like a layman,
and that I had come to hear his confession.
‘If that is the reason why you
have come, it is in vain,’ he said; ‘the
time for it is passed away.’ I said to him:
‘What! are you not a Catholic? If you
are, you know what you have to do. This
hour, which seems to be your last, has
been given you that by making a good
and sincere confession you may, while
there is time, wash away the stains of
your past life, whatever they are.’ He
answered: ‘I tell you that you have come
too late: that time has gone by. The
judgment is decided; the sentence has
been pronounced; I am condemned, and
given up to the enemy. I cannot hope
for pardon.’ ‘That is false,’ I answered,
‘and it is a most fearful error to imagine
that a man still in life can assert that he
is already deprived of God’s goodness
and abandoned by his grace, in such a
way that even when he desires and implores
mercy it should be denied him.
Since your faith teaches you that God is
infinitely merciful, you are to believe with
all certitude that there is no bond so
straitly fastened but the grace of God
can unloose it, no obstacle but grace has
power to surmount it.’ ‘But do you not
see,’ he asked me, ‘how full of evil
spirits this place is where we are? There
is no corner or crevice in the walls where
there are not more than a thousand of the
most dark and frightful demons, who,
with their fierce faces, horrid looks, and
atrocious words threaten perpetually
that they are just going to carry me into
the abyss of misery. Why, even my very
body and entrails are filled with these
hateful guests, who are lacerating my
body and torturing my soul with such
dreadful cruelty and anguish that it
seems as if I were not so much on the
point merely of going there, as that I am
already devoted and made over to the
flames and agonies of hell. Wherefore, it
is clear that God has abandoned me for
ever, and has cast me away from all hope
of pardon.’</p>

<p>“When I had listened in trembling to
all these things, and to much more of a
similar kind, and saw at the same time
that death was coming fast upon him, and
that he would not admit of any advice or
persuasion, I began to think within myself,
in silence and anxiety, what would be
the wisest course to choose. There entered
into my mind, through the inspiration,
doubtless, of God, the following most
useful plan and method of dealing with
him: ‘Well, then,’ I said, ‘if you are
going to be lost, I do not require a confession
from you; nevertheless, recollect
yourself just for a moment, and, with a
quiet mind, answer me, in a few words,
either yes or no to the questions that I
put to you; I ask for nothing else, and
put upon you no other burden.’ Then I
began to question him, and to follow the
order of the Commandments. First,
whether he had denied his faith. ‘See,’ I
said, ‘do not worry yourself; say just
those simple words, yes or no.’ As soon
as he had finished either affirming or denying
anything, I proceeded through four
or five Commandments&mdash;whether he had
killed any one, stolen anything, etc.
When he had answered with tolerable
calmness, I said to him, ‘What are the
devils doing now? What do you feel or
suffer from them?’ He replied: ‘They
are quieter with me; they do not seem to
be so furious as they were before.’ ‘Lift
up your soul to God,’ I said, ‘and
let us go on to the rest.’ In the same
fashion and order I continued to question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
him about other things. Then I enquired
again, saying, ‘How is it now?’ He replied;
‘Within I am not tormented. The
devils stand at a distance; they throw
stones; they make dreadful faces at me,
and threaten me horribly. I do not think
that I shall escape.’ Going forward as
before, I allured and encouraged the man
by degrees, till every moment he became
more reasonable, and at last made an entire
confession of all his sins, after which
I gave him absolution, and asked him
what he was suffering from his cruel and
harassing enemies. ‘Nothing,’ he said;
‘they have all vanished. There is not a
trace of them, thanks be to God.’ Then
I went away, after strengthening him by
a few words, and encouraging him beforehand
against temptations which might return.
I promised, at the same time, that I
would be with him on the morrow, and
meant to bring the most Sacred Body of
Christ with me, and warned him to prepare
himself diligently for the receiving of so
excellent a banquet. The whole following
night he passed without molestation from
the enemy, and on the next day he received
with great tranquillity of mind the most
Holy Sacrament, after which, at an interval
of a few hours without disturbance, he
breathed forth his soul, and quietly gave
it up to God. Before he died, I asked the
man what cause had driven him into such
desperation of mind. He answered me
thus: ‘I was detained in prison many
years for the Catholic faith. Nevertheless,
I did not cease to sin, and to conceal
my sins from my confessor, being persuaded
by the devil that pardon must be
sought for from God, rather by penances
and severity of life, than by confession.
Hence I either neglected my confessions
altogether, or else made insincere ones;
and so I fell into that melancholy of
mind and that state of tribulation which
has been my punishment.’”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Light leading unto Light</span>: A Series
of Sonnets and Poems. By John
Charles Earle, B.A. London: Burns
&amp; Oates. 1875.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Earle has undoubtedly a facility
in writing sonnets; and a good sonnet
has been well called “a whole poem in
itself.” It is also, we think, peculiarly
suitable for didactic poetry. The present
sonnets are in advance, we consider,
of those we first saw from Mr. Earle’s
pen. But we still observe faults, both
of diction and of verse, which he should
have learnt to avoid. His model seems
to be Wordsworth&mdash;the greatest sonneteer
in our language; but, like him, he
has too much of the prosaic and the artificial.</p>

<p>We wish we could bestow unqualified
praise upon the ideas throughout these
sonnets. And were there nothing for
criticism but what may be called poetic
subtleties&mdash;such as the German notion
of an “ether body,” developed during
life, and hatched at death, for our intermediate
state of being&mdash;we should have
no quarrel with Mr. Earle. But when we
meet two sonnets (XLVIII. and XLIX.)
headed “Matter Non-Existent,” and
“Matter Non-Substantial,” we have a
philosophical error serious in its consequences,
and are not surprised to find
the two following sonnets teach Pantheism.
In Sonnet XLVIII. the author’s
excellent intention is to refute materialism:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“‘Thought is,’ you say, ‘a function of the brain,</div>
<div class="verse">And matter all that we can ever know;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse center">…</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“‘From it we came; to it at last we go,</div>
<div class="verse">And all beyond it is a phantom vain,’ etc.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse center">…</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I answer: ‘Matter is <em>a form of mind</em>,</div>
<div class="verse"><em>So far as it is aught</em>. It has no base,</div>
<div class="verse">Save in the self-existent.’”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sonnet L. is headed, “As the Soul in
the Body, so is God in the Universe.”
Surely, this is the old “Anima Mundi”
theory! Then, in Sonnet LI., the poet
says of nature, and addressing God:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“She cannot live detached from thee. Her heart</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Is beating with thy pulse. <em>I cannot tell</em></div>
<div class="verse"><em>How far she is or is not of thee part</em>;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">How far in her thou dost or dost not dwell;</div>
<div class="verse">That <em>thou her only base and substance art</em>,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">This&mdash;this at least&mdash;I know and feel full well.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now, of course, Mr. Earle is unconscious
that this is rank Pantheism. He
has a way of explaining it to himself
which makes it sound perfectly orthodox.
But we do call such a blunder inexcusable
in a Catholic writer of Mr. Earle’s
pretensions. The title of his volume,
“Light leading unto Light,” has little
to do with the contents, as far as we can
see; and, certainly, there are passages
which would more fitly be headed “Darkness
leading unto Darkness.”</p>

<p>We are sorry to have had to make
these strictures. The great bulk of the
sonnets, together with the remaining
poems, are very pleasant reading, and
cannot fail to do good.</p>

</div>

<p>We are glad to see Father Noethen’s
familiar hand thus charitably and characteristically
engaged. These are the first
documents of the kind we have observed
under the improving state of things in
this country, in which the priest of the
Church is seen occupied in one of his
most important duties&mdash;reclaiming the
erring; and in doing this the means
which he employs will doubtless be found
more efficacious than any the state has
at its command. Did the state fully
appreciate its highest interest as well as
duty, it would afford the Church every
facility, not only in reclaiming such of
her children as have fallen into the temptations
by which they are surrounded,
but also in the use of those preventive
measures involved in parish schools,
which would save multitudes from penitentiaries
and houses of correction. Our
over-zealous Protestant friends throw
every obstacle in the way of the adequate
moral and religious training of the class
most exposed to the temptations arising
from poverty and lack of employment,
and then blame the Church for the result.
We heartily welcome these signs of a
better time coming.</p>

<h3>FREEMASONRY.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></h3>

<p>The saints have all, whilst yet in
the flesh, foretastes of heavenly
bliss. But in these the closing days
of time all the elect have a presentiment
of coming judgment.
And that presentiment is strong in
proportion to their faith; stronger
still in proportion to their charity.
Let our readers be assured at the
outset. We are not about to imitate
the irreverence of the Scotch
Presbyterian minister who, some few
years ago, pretended that he had
discovered in the prophetic visions
of S. John the year in which will
come to pass that event of stupendous
awfulness, of which He, before
whom all mankind will then be
judged, said: “Of that day or hour
no one knows, neither the angels in
heaven, nor the Son, but the Father
only.”</p>

<p>One fearful catastrophe, however,
to befall mankind before the general
judgment is insisted on so often
and with such solemn emphasis by
the Holy Spirit that the love of God
seems to be, as it were, trembling
for his redeemed creature, and longing
to reveal to him more than is
consistent with his own designs in
the trial of his faith. For it must
be remembered that faith is a merit,
and the absolutely indispensable
condition of our receiving the benefits
of the divine atonement. Although
the gift of God, it is the
part we ourselves, by co-operating
with the gift, contribute towards
our own salvation. And what we
are required to believe is so beautiful
and ennobling to the moral
sense, and so satisfying to the reason,
that, supported as it is by the
historical evidence of the divinity
of Christ and of his church, no one
can refuse to believe but those who
deliberately choose darkness rather
than light, sin rather than virtue,
Satan rather than God.</p>

<p>Yet so formidable was to be that
last trial of the faith of Christians,
so crucial that conclusive test of
their charity, which was to “deceive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
if it were possible, even the
very elect,”<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> that the Spirit of Love,
yearning for the safety of his regenerate
ones, and compassionating
the weakness of human nature, revealed
its marks and signs in the
fullest and most circumstantial detail;
so that, warned of the danger,
and recognizing it when it arrived,
they might pass through it unhurt,
whilst those who succumbed to it
might be without excuse before the
divine justice. It is the yearning
of the heart of Christ towards his
children, whom he foresees will fail
by thousands in that decisive trial,
which prompts the ejaculation that
sounds almost like a lament over
his own inability to put any pressure
on their free-will: “When the Son
of man cometh, will he find faith on
the earth?” It is his anxiety, as it
were, about the fate of his elect
amidst the seductions of that appalling
apostasy, which urged him, after
he had indicated the signs that
would accompany it, to be on the
perpetual, sleepless lookout for
them. “Be ever on the alert. Lo!
I have foretold you all.”<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>“Be ever on the alert, watch and
pray. For you do not know when
the time may be.”<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>“Watch, then, lest when he (the
head of the family) shall have
come on a sudden, you be found
sleeping.”<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>“Moreover, what I say to you I
<em>say to all</em>: Watch!”<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Throughout all the ages that have
elapsed since those words of solemn
import fell from the lips of Jesus
Christ it has been the plain duty
of all Christians&mdash;nay, of all to
whose knowledge they were brought&mdash;to
narrowly scrutinize events, to
keep their attention fixed upon
them, watching for the signs he
foretold, lest they should appear
unheeded, and they be seduced from
the faith; or be the cause, through
their indifference, of others being
carried away in the great misleading.</p>

<p>But who now can be insensible
to the predicted portents? So notorious
are they, and so exactly do
they answer to the description of
them handed down to us from the
beginning, that they rudely arouse
us from sleep; that they force our
attention, however indifferent to
them we may be, however dull our
faith or cold our charity. And
when we see a vast organization
advancing its forces in one united
movement throughout the entire
globe in an avowed attack, as insidious
as it is formidable, upon altars,
thrones, social order, Christianity,
Christ, and God himself, where is
the heart that can be insensible to
the touching evidence of loving
solicitude which urged Him whom
surging multitudes of his false creatures
were deliberately to reject in
favor of a fouler being than Barabbas,
to iterate so often the warning
admonition, “Be ever on the
watch”?</p>

<p>To study, therefore, the signs of
the times, cannot be without profit
to all, but especially to us who
have but scant respect for the spirit
of the age, who are not sufficiently
enlightened by it to look upon
Christ as nothing more than a remarkable
man, the sublime morality
he taught and set an example of as
a nuisance, and his church as the
enemy of mankind, to be extirpated
from their midst, because it forbids
their enjoying the illumination of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the dagger-guarded secrets of the
craft of Freemasonry.</p>

<p>To fix the date of the <i lang="la">Dies iræ</i> is
completely out of our power. It is
irreverent, if not blasphemous, to
attempt it. It is of the counsels of
God that it should come with the
swiftness of “lightning” and the
unexpectedness of “a thief in the
night”; and that expressly that we
may be ever on the watch. But
the signs of its approach are given
to us in order to help those who
do not abandon “watching” in
indifference, to escape the great
delusion&mdash;the imposition of Antichrist&mdash;which
is to immediately
precede it. It is these signs we
propose to study in the following
pages.</p>

<p>The predictions of Christ himself
on this subject are far more obscure
than those subsequently given to
us by his apostles. But this has
always been God’s way of revelation
to his creature. To Moses
alone, in the mount, he revealed
the moral law and that wondrous
theocratic polity which remained
even after the perversity of his people
had given it a monarchical
form; and Moses communicated it
to the people. To the people
Christ spoke in parables, “and
without a parable spake he not
unto them. But when he was
alone with them, he explained all to
his disciples.”<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> “To you,” he
said, “it is given to have known
the mystery of the kingdom of
God; but to those without everything
is a parable.”<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The apostles
themselves, who were to declare
the revelation, in order to increase
the merit of their faith, were not
fully illuminated before the coming
down of the Holy Spirit. “You do
not know this parable?” he said;
“and how are you going to understand
all parables?”<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> To their
utterances, therefore, it is we shall
confine ourselves, as shedding as
much light as it has seemed good to
the Holy Ghost to disclose to us
upon the profounder and more oracular
predictions of God himself in
the flesh.</p>

<p>Besides SS. Peter, Paul, and
John, S. Jude is the only other
apostle, we believe, who has bequeathed
to the church predictions
of the terrible apostasy of Antichrist
which is to consummate the
trial of the faith of the saints under
the very shadow of the coming
judgment. We will take them in
the order in which they occur. The
first is in a letter of S. Paul to the
church at Thessalonica, where, exhorting
them not to “be terrified
as if the day of the Lord were at
hand,” he assures them that it will
not come “before there shall have
first happened an apostasy, and the
man of sin shall have been revealed,
the son of perdition&mdash;he who opposes
himself to, and raises himself
above, all that is called God, or
that is held in honor, so that he may
sit in the temple of God, showing
himself as if he were God.…
And you know what now is hindering
his being revealed in his
own time. For the mystery of iniquity
is already working; only so
that he who is now keeping it in
check will keep it in check until
he be moved out of its way. And
then will the lawless one be revealed,
whom the Lord Jesus will slay
with the breath of his mouth, and
destroy with the illumination of his
coming; whose coming is after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
manner of working of Satan, with
all strength and symbols, and lying
absurdities, and in every enticement
of iniquity in those who perish; for
the reason that they did not receive
the love of the truth that they
might be saved. So God will send
them the working of error, that they
may believe falsehood; that all may
be judged who have not believed
the truth, but have consented to
iniquity.”<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>In a letter to Timothy, Bishop
of Ephesus, S. Paul writes: “Now,
the Spirit says expressly that, in the
last times, some shall apostatize
from the faith, giving heed to spirits
of error and to doctrines of demons,
speaking falsehood in hypocrisy,
and having their own conscience
seared.”<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>In a second letter to the same
bishop he writes: “Know this,
moreover: that in the last days
there will be a pressure of perilous
times; men will be self-lovers, covetous,
lifted up, proud, blasphemous,
disobedient to parents, ungrateful,
malicious, without affection,
discontented, calumniators,
incontinent, hard, unamiable, traitors,
froward, fearful, and lovers of
pleasures more than lovers of God,
having indeed a form of piety, but
denying its power.”<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> S. Peter
writes that “there will come in the
last days mockers in deception,
walking according to their own
lusts.”<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>S. Jude describes them as
“mockers, walking in impieties according
to their own desires. These
are they who separate themselves&mdash;animals,
not having the Spirit.”<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>It would seem from the expressions
of S. John-who of all the
apostles appears to have had most
pre-eminently the gift of prophecy&mdash;as
well as from the manner in
which the last days of Jerusalem
and the last days of the world appear
to be mingled together in the
fore-announcement of Christ, that
powerful manifestations of Antichrist
were to precede both events;
although the apostasy was to be far
more extensive and destructive before
the latter. “Little children,”
writes the favorite apostle, “it is
the last time; and as you have
heard that Antichrist comes, so
now many have become Antichrists;
whence we know that it
is the last time.… He is Antichrist
who denies the Father and
the Son.”<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>“Every spirit who abolishes Jesus
is not of God. And he is Antichrist
about whom we have heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
that he is coming, and is even now
in the world.”<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>We believe that these are the only
passages wherein the Holy Ghost
has vouchsafed to give us distinct
and definite information as to the
marks and evidences by which we
are to know that there is amongst
us that Antichrist whose disastrous
although short-lived triumph is
to precede by only a short space
the end of time and the eternal enfranchisement
of good from evil.</p>

<p>The prophetic utterances on this
subject in the revelations of S. John
are veiled in such exceedingly obscure
imagery that we do not propose
to attempt any investigation of their
meaning in this article. It is our object
to influence the minds of such
Protestants as believe in God the Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit, and of
Catholics whose faith is so dull and
whose charity is so cold that they
can listen to the blasphemies of
Antichrist without emotion.</p>

<p>We may remark here, however,
that if we succeed in supplying solid
reasons for believing that Antichrist
is already amongst us, and
that his dismal career of desolating
victory has already begun, the duty
of studying those utterances of
the Holy Ghost, so darkly veiled
that the faith of those who stand
firm may have more merit in the
trial of that great tribulation, will
have assumed a position of importance
impossible to be overrated.
That they are to be understood,
the Holy Ghost himself implies.
He intimates that their meaning is
accessible to the spiritually minded,
and would even seem to make
dulness of apprehension of it a reproach,
a lack of spiritual discernment.
“If any one has the ear,
let him hear,”<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> he writes. And
again: “This is wisdom. Let
him who has understanding reckon
the number of the beast.”<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>It is not necessary to the object
we have in view that we should
identify “the beast” of the Apocalypse,
seven-headed and having
ten horns crowned with diadems,
with Antichrist. The question we
propose to answer is simply, “Are
there under our eyes at this moment
evidences of a present Antichrist,
or of his being close at
hand?” In other words, “Is what
is called ‘the spirit of the age’ the
spirit of Antichrist?”</p>

<p>For us, that we may be on our
guard against his wiles, and armed
to the teeth to fight against him to
the death, it is comparatively unimportant
whether we decide him
to be actually amongst us or only
just about to appear. His marks
and characteristics, his badges or
decorations&mdash;these are all we require.</p>

<p>If the Antichrist of the prophecies
is a single, separate impersonation
of the demoniac attributes described
by the Holy Ghost&mdash;if, in
short, he is an individual man, then
he has not yet been revealed. In
that case, our identification of Antichrist
will only have exposed that
temper and spirit with which “the red
dragon”&mdash;“the devil”&mdash;“Satan”&mdash;“the
ancient serpent”&mdash;has possessed
such vast multitudes of the
human race throughout the entire
globe as to afford ground for calling
it “the spirit of the age,” and
which is to culminate in some terrible
personal embodiment&mdash;a typical
personage, as men speak. But
if the prophecies do not designate
an individual man, but only the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
impersonation of a multitude of individuals
organized into a unity and
animated with the same spirit, then
we think we shall be able to point the
finger of horror and loathing at the
very Antichrist at present amongst
us, and in the midst of victory, as
decisively and as clearly as the prophet
of penance pointed the finger
of adoring love towards the Lamb
of God.</p>

<p>We incline, and strongly, to the
latter view. We must withhold our
reasons, partly because, as we have
said, our object is equally subserved
by either view; but more because
to do so would leave us too
little space for treating the main
subject. We will content ourselves
with stating that those reasons are
founded on the internal evidence
supplied by the several predictions;
and also on our aversion to admit
the possibility of a more depraved
<em>individual</em> impersonation of evil
than that unhappy man whom God
in human flesh pronounced a
devil!</p>

<p>Whether, however, Antichrist be
or not an individual man, one
thing is certain: that if we can
point out an immense army of men,
co-extensive with the globe, highly
organized, animated with the same
spirit, and acting with as much
unity of purpose as if their movements
were directed by one head,
who exhibit precisely those marks
and characteristics described in
the predictions of Antichrist, we
may expect even on the supposition
that they are to have a visible
head, an individual leader, who has
yet to make his appearance; and
that they are his hosts, who have
already achieved a great part of
his victories.</p>

<p>What is first noticeable is that
the stigma which is to be deeply
branded on the front of the Antichristian
manifestation which is to
precede the close of time is “<em>Apostasy</em>”.</p>

<p>The day of the Lord will not
come, “nisi venerit discessio primum;
Spiritus dicit quia in novissimis
temporibus quidam a fide
discedunt.”</p>

<p>There can be no need of dwelling
on this. It is sufficiently obvious
that the great apostasy inaugurated
by Luther was the first
outbreak of Antichristian victory.
The success of that movement assured
the spirit of error of a career
of victory. He was lurking in
the fold, watching for his opportunity,
and snatching away stray
souls, as S. John tells us, in the
time of the apostles. For a millennium
and a half has he been preparing
his manifestation. He inspired
Julian, he inspired the Arians, he
inspired all the heresies against
which the definitions of the faith
were decreed. But when he had
seduced men away from the church,
whole nations at a time, “dominationem
contemnentes” (2 S. Peter ii.
10), and captivated them to the irrational
opinion that there is no higher
authority for the obligatory dogmas
of the Christian Church than the
conviction of every individual, <i lang="la">solvere
Jesum</i>, and then God, was merely
a matter of time. What human
passion had begun human reason
would complete. The life of faith
could not be annihilated at a blow.
It has taken three centuries for the
sap of charity to wither away in
the cut-off branches. But sooner
or later the green wood could not
but become dry; and reason, void
of charity, would be forced to acknowledge
that if the Bible has no
definite meaning other than what
appears to be its meaning to every
individual, practically it has no
definite meaning at all; that God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
cannot have revealed any truth at
all, if we have no means of ascertaining
what it is beyond our own
private opinions; that a book the
text of which admits of as many interpretations
as there are sects cannot,
without an authoritative living
expositor, reveal truths which it is
necessary to believe in order to
escape eternal punishment. The
claim of the Catholic Church to
this authority having been pronounced
an usurpation, the progress,
although slow, was sure and easy
towards pronouncing Christianity
itself an usurpation. God himself
cannot survive Christianity. And
we have now literally “progressed”
to so triumphant a manifestation
of Antichrist that the work of
persecution of God’s Church has
set in with a vengeance, and men
hear on all sides of them the existence
of God denied without horror,
even without surprise.</p>

<p>The first mark of a present Antichrist
we propose to signalize is that
distinctly assigned to him by S.
Paul&mdash;ὁ ἄνομος. This epithet is but
feebly rendered by the Latin <i lang="la">ille
iniquus</i>, or the English “that wicked
one.” “The lawless one” better
conveys the force of the Greek.
For the root νόμος includes in its
meaning not only enacted law of all
kinds, but whatever has become, as it
were, a law by custom; or a law of
nature, as it were, by the universal
observance of mankind.</p>

<p>The first marked sequel of the
apostasy, the first outbreak of success
of Antichrist in the political
order, was the first French Revolution,
during which a harlot was
placed for worship upon the altar
of Notre Dame.</p>

<p>That fearful outbreak may have
sat for its portrait to S. Peter in
the following description of the
members of the Antichrist of the
“last times”: “Who walk after the
flesh in the lust of concupiscence,
and despise authority; … irrational
beasts, following only their
own brute impulses, made only to
be caught and slain; … having
eyes full of adultery and of ceaseless
sin; … speaking proud
things of vanity, enticing, through
the desires of the luxury of the
flesh, those who by degrees go away
from the truth, who become habituated
to error; promising them liberty,
whereas they themselves are
the slaves of corruption” (2 Pet.
ii. 10, 12, 14, 18, 19).</p>

<p>That saturnalia of lawlessness,
which Freemason writers have ever
since dared to approve, was the
work of the “craft” of Freemasonry,
to whose organization and
plan of action does indeed, in an
especial sense, apply S. Paul’s designation
of τὸ μυστήριον τῆς
ανομίας “the mystery of lawlessness.”
Mirabeau, Sieyès, Grégoire,
Robespierre, Condorcet, Fauchet,
Guillotine, Bonneville, Volney,
“Philippe Egalité,” etc., had all
been initiated into the higher
grades.</p>

<p>Louis Blanc, himself a Freemason,
writes thus: “It is necessary
to conduct the reader to the
opening of the subterranean mine
laid at that time beneath thrones
and altars by revolutionists, differing
greatly, both in their theory and
their practice, from the Encyclopedists.
An association had been
formed of men of every land, every
religion, and every class, bound together
by mysterious signs agreed
upon amongst themselves, pledged
by a solemn oath to observe inviolable
secrecy as to the existence of
this hidden bond, and tested by
proofs of a terrible description.…
Thus we find Freemasonry
to have been widely diffused immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
before the outbreak of the
Revolution. Spreading over the
whole face of Europe, it poisoned
the thinking minds of Germany,
and secretly stirred up rebellion in
France, showing itself everywhere
in the light of an association resting
upon principles diametrically
opposed to those which govern
civil society.… The ordinances
of Freemasonry did indeed
make great outward display of obedience
to law, of respect to the outward
forms and usages of profane
society, and of reverence towards
rulers; at their banquets the Masons
did indeed drink the health of
kings in the days of monarchy, and
of presidents in the time of republics,
such prudent circumspection
being indispensable on the part of an
association which threatened the
existence of the very governments
under whose eyes it was compelled
to work, and whose suspicion it had
already aroused. This, nevertheless,
did not suffice to counteract the
radically revolutionary influence
continually exercised by the craft,
even while it professed nothing but
peaceful intentions.”<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>In the work from which the
above and the greater part of our
materials in this article are borrowed,
we read as follows: “It was
precisely these revolutionary designs
of the secret society which
induced its Provincial Grand Master,
the Prussian Minister Count
von Haugwitz, to leave it. In the
memorial presented by him to the
Congress of Monarchs at Verona,
in 1830, he bids the rulers of
Europe to be on their guard against
the hydra. ‘I feel at this moment
firmly persuaded,’ writes the ex-grand
master, ‘that the French
Revolution, which had its first
commencement in 1788, and broke
out soon after, attended with all the
horrors of regicide, existed heaven
knows how long before, having
been planned, and having had the
way prepared for it, by associations
and secret oaths.’”<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>And the following:</p>

<p>“After the events of February,
1848, the ‘craft’ sang songs of
triumph at the open success of its
secret endeavors. A Belgian brother,
Van der Heym, spoke thus:
‘On the day following the revolution
of February a whole nation
rose as one man, overturned the
throne, and wrote over the frontal of
the royal palace the words Liberty,
Fraternity, Equality, all the citizens
having adopted as their own
this fundamental principle of Freemasonry.
The combatants had
not to battle long before the victory
over their oppressors was
gained&mdash;that freedom won which
for centuries had formed the theme
of Masonic discourses. We, the
apostles of fraternity, aid the foundation-stone
of the Republic.’”<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>And another master of the Freemasons,
one Peigné, said about the
same time: “In our glorious Revolution
of 1792 the Lodge of the
Nine Sisters gave to the world
such men as Garat, Brissot, Bailly,
Camille Desmoulins, Condorcet,
Champfort, Petion; the Lodge of
the Iron Mouth gave to it Fauchet,
Goupil de Prefeln, Sieyès; the
Lodge of Candor, Custine, the two
Lameths, and Lafayette.”</p>

<p>The horrors of that Revolution
occasioned a temporary reaction
and checked the triumphs of the
Freemasons. But well they know
how to repair their broken fortunes,
bide their time, and reappear with
renewed force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Barruel, who was an eye-witness
of the events of the period, and
also himself intimately acquainted
with many Freemasons in Paris, relates
that the brethren, considering
that the time had come when they
were free to publish the secret they
had sworn to keep, shouted aloud:
“At last our goal is reached; from
this day France will be one vast
lodge, and all Frenchmen Freemasons.”</p>

<p>A strong reaction of disgust and
terror at the satanic orgies of Freemasonry
in the ascendant, moderated
for a while this shout of triumph.
But in the disasters inflicted on
France by the conquering Germans,
the “craft” thought to find a recurring
opportunity. If the Communist
attempt at Paris in 1871
was not originally planned by the
Freemasons, they openly and officially
joined it. “A procession
composed of at least five thousand
persons, in which members of all
the grades took part, wearing their
insignia, and in which one hundred
and fifty lodges of France were represented,
wended its way to the
town hall of Paris. Maillet, bearing
the red flag as a token of universal
peace, headed the band, and openly
proclaimed, in a speech which met
with the approval of all present,
that the new Commune was the antitype
of Solomon’s temple and the
corner-stone of the social fabric
about to be raised by the efforts of
the craft. The negotiations carried
on with the government of Versailles
on behalf of the socialists,
and the way in which they planted
the banners of the craft on the walls
of the capital, accompanying this
action with a threat of instantly
joining the ranks of the combatants
if a single shot were fired at one of
those banners (of which a graphic
account appeared in the <cite>Figaro</cite> at
the time), was all of a piece with
the sentiments they expressed” (<cite>The
Secret Warfare of Freemasonry</cite>, p.
172).</p>

<p><cite>Figaro</cite> closed its account of
these strange events with the following
reflections: “But when posterity
shall be informed that in the
middle of the XIXth century, in
the midst of an unbelieving generation,
which openly denied God and
his Christ, under the very guns of
an enemy in possession of all the
French fortresses, hostilities were
all at once suspended, and the
course of a portentous and calamitous
civil war interrupted because,
forsooth, Brother Thirifoque, accompanied
by two Knights Kadosch,
went to offer to M. Thiers’
acceptance the golden mallet of
supreme command (in the craft)&mdash;when,
I say, this story is told to
those who come after us, it will
sound in their ears as a nursery
tale, utterly unworthy of credence.”<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>In <cite>Révélations d’un Franc-maçon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
au lit de mort, pièce authentique, publicé,
par</cite> M. de Hallet (Courtrai,
1826, p. 10), we find the following:
“We must restore man to his primeval
rights, no longer recognizing
rank and dignity&mdash;two things the
mere sight of which offends the eye
of man and wounds his self-love.
Obedience is a mere chimera, and
has no place in the wise plans of
Providence.”</p>

<p>In the <cite>Astræa, Taschenbuch für
Freimaurer</cite>, von Bruder Sydow
(1845), an orator thus speaks:
“That which is destined to destruction
must in the course of things
be destroyed; and if human powers
resist this law, at the behest of
fate, a stronger power will appear
upon the scene to carry out the
eternal decrees of Providence. The
Reformation of the church, as well
as the French Revolution, proves
the existence of this law.…
Revolution is a crisis necessary to
development.”</p>

<p>The <cite>Révélations</cite> says: “The poison
must be neutralized by means
of its antidote, revolution must
succeed to obedience, vengeance
follow upon effeminacy, power must
grapple with power, and the reign
of superstition yield before that of
the one true natural religion.”</p>

<p>Barruel, who had been a master
Mason, states that the oath administered
to him was: “My brother,
are you prepared to execute every
command you may receive from
the Grand Master, even should contrary
orders be laid on you by king
or emperor, or any other ruler
whatever?”</p>

<p>“The grade of Kadosch”&mdash;the
thirtieth grade&mdash;writes Barruel (p.
222), “is the soul of Freemasonry,
and the final object of its plots
is the reintroduction of absolute
liberty and equality through the
destruction of all royalty and the
abrogation of all religious worship.”</p>

<p>“Socialism, Freemasonry, and
communism have, after all, a common
origin” (The <cite>Latomia</cite>&mdash;an organ
of the craft&mdash;vol. xii. p. 237).</p>

<p><cite>Le Libertaire</cite>, a Masonic journal
published in this city, had the following
in 1858: “The <cite>Libertaire</cite>
knows no country but that which is
common to all. He is a sworn foe
to restraints of every kind. He
hates the boundaries of countries;
he hates the boundaries of fields,
houses, workshops; he hates the
boundaries of family.”</p>

<p>Is it within the power of the human
mind to conceive of any possible
individual or spiritual incarnation
more deeply, vividly, and distinctly
branded with the note-mark
or sign of Antichrist, given to us
by the Holy Spirit some two thousand
years ago, by which we might
recognize him when he appeared&mdash;“the
lawless one,” “spurning authority”&mdash;ὁ
ἄνομος, qui contemnunt
dominationem?</p>

<p>And when we add to this, the one
special and most wicked and lawless
characteristic of the “craft”&mdash;its
portentous mystery&mdash;to our
thinking, they must willingly, and
of set purpose, close their eyes who
fail to detect in it the very Antichrist
whom the apostle declares shall be
manifested in the last days, after
the apostasy, and whom he designates
by the epithet τὸ μυστήριον
τῆς ἀνομίας&mdash;“the mystery of lawlessness”&mdash;which
he tells us had
even then, at the very cradle of
the church, begun to put in movement
its long conspiracy against
the salvation of mankind: τὸ γὰρ
μυστηριον ἢδη ενεργεῖται τῆς
ἀνομίας&mdash;“for the mystery of
lawlessness is even now already
working.”</p>

<p>No sooner was Christ born than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
his infant life was sought; no sooner
did he begin to teach than “the
ancient serpent” sought his ruin;
just before the triumph of his resurrection
the enemy of mankind
seemed to have finally and completely
triumphed in his crucifixion;
no sooner had his church,
brought to life by his resurrection,
begun her work of saving mankind
than the devil was at work with his
“mystery of lawlessness” for her
destruction. All along it is Antichrist
dogging the steps of Christ;
before the second coming of Christ
there is to be the second coming
of Antichrist; before the final triumph
over evil and revelation of
the sons of God, Antichrist is to
have that his last open and avowed
manifestation&mdash;ἀποκάλυψις&mdash;and
success, which the craft of
Freemasonry is already so far on
the road to compassing.</p>

<p>Whether or no he is to receive a
serious check before that terrific
triumph over all but the few remaining
elect we know not. But
so unmistakable is his present manifestation
that it is woe to those
who blink their eyes and follow in
his wake! Woe to those whose judicial
blindness causes them to
“believe a lie”! Woe to those who
are caught napping!</p>

<p>The next of the indications given
us by the Holy Spirit of the Antichrist
is his <i lang="la">modus operandi</i>&mdash;his
method&mdash;the way in which he will
effect his purposes, “whose coming
is according to the way of working
of Satan”&mdash;<i lang="la">cujus est adventus secundum
operationem Satanæ</i>.</p>

<p>The beast with seven heads and
ten horns crowned with diadems
described in the Apocalypse is, we
are there told, fully commissioned
with his own power by the red
dragon, whom we are distinctly informed
is the old serpent, who is
called the devil (διάβολος, or
slanderer), “Satan, who deceives
the whole world.”</p>

<p>Now, Satan is designated as “the
prince of darkness” in opposition
to Christ, “who is the true light, enlightening
every one that cometh
into the world”; he is the father
of those who “hate the light because
their deeds are evil.” When
he would destroy Christ, “night
was his hour and the power of
darkness.” But in taking a survey
of the craft of Freemasonry, what
first seizes our attention? Is it not
the profound darkness in which all
its operations are veiled? Those
terrible oaths of secrecy, made under
the assured menace of assassination,
attended with all that sanguinary
gibberish, the lie involved
in which is not known until the
“seared conscience” is already in
the chains of hell&mdash;surely, if anything
is, these are “secundum operationem
Satanæ.”</p>

<p>In the <cite>Vienna Freemason’s Journal</cite>,
MSS. for circulation in the
craft, second year of issue, No. 1,
p. 66, is the following: “We wander
amidst our adversaries, shrouded
in threefold darkness. Their
passions serve as wires, whereby,
unknown to themselves, we set
them in motion and compel them
unwittingly to work in union with
us.”</p>

<p>In a work written in High-German,
the authorship of which is
ascribed to a Prof. Hoffman of
Vienna, the contents of which are
supported by documentary evidence,
and of which a Dutch
translation was published in Amsterdam
in 1792, which was reprinted
at the Hague in 1826, the
method of working of this “mystery
of lawlessness” is thus summed
up:</p>

<p>“2. To effect this, a literary association<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
must be formed to promote
the circulation of our writings,
and suppress, as far as possible, those
of our opponents.</p>

<p>“3. For this end we must contrive
to have in our pay the publishers
of the leading literary journals of
the day, in order that they may
turn into ridicule and heap contempt
on everything written in a
contrary interest to our own.</p>

<p>“4. ‘He that is not with us is
against us.’ Therefore we may
persecute, calumniate, and tread
down such an one without scruple;
individuals like this are noxious insects
which one shakes from the
blossoming tree and crushes beneath
one’s foot.</p>

<p>“5. Very few can bear to be made
to look ridiculous; let ridicule,
therefore, be the weapon employed
against persons who, though by no
means devoid of sense, show themselves
hostile to our schemes.</p>

<p>“6. In order the more quickly to
attain our end, the middle classes
of society must be thoroughly imbued
with our principles; the lower
orders and the mass of the
population are of little importance,
as they may easily be moulded to
our will. The middle classes are
the principal supporters of the
government; to gain them we must
work on their passions, and, above
all, bring up the rising generation
in our ideas, as in a few years they
will be in their turn masters of the
situation.</p>

<p>“7. License in morals will be the
best means of enabling us to provide
ourselves with patrons at
court&mdash;persons who are nevertheless
totally ignorant of the importance
of our cause. It will suffice for
our purpose if we make them absolutely
indifferent to the Christian
religion. They are for the most
part careless enough without us.</p>

<p>“8. If our aims are to be pursued
with vigor, it is of absolute necessity
to regard as enemies of enlightenment
and of philosophy all
those who cling in any way to religious
or civil prejudices, and exhibit
this attachment in their writings.
They must be viewed as
beings whose influence is highly
prejudicial to the human race, and
a great obstacle to its well-being
and progress. On this account it
becomes the duty of each one of
us to impede their action in all
matters of consequence, and to
seize the first suitable opportunity
which may present itself of putting
them entirely <i lang="fr">hors du combat</i>.</p>

<p>“9. We must ever be on the watch
to make all changes in the state
serve our own ends; political
parties, cabals, brotherhoods, and
unions&mdash;in short, everything that
affords an opportunity of creating
disturbances must be an instrument
in our hands. For it is only on
the ruins of society as it exists at
present that we can hope to erect a
solid structure on the natural system,
and ensure to the worshippers
of nature the free exercise of their
rights.”</p>

<p>If this method of working, <i lang="la">operatio</i>,
is not <i lang="la">secundum adventum Satanæ</i>,
we should be glad to know what is.
Herein we find every feature of
Antichrist and his hosts which the
Holy Ghost has drawn for our warning.
They are heaped together in
such hideous combination throughout
this summary as scarcely to
need particularizing. Our readers
may not, however, be unwilling that
we should single them out one by
one as they appear more or less
prominently in the several paragraphs;
premising that throughout
one characteristic reigns and
prevails, and, indeed, lends its color
to all the rest, that special attribute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
of “the father of lies”&mdash;falsehood!</p>

<p>We will take the paragraphs in
order, and photograph their most
prominent Antichristian features.</p>

<p><i>The first.</i>&mdash;Spurning authority.
Giving ear to spirits of error and
doctrines of demons.</p>

<p>Speaking lies in hypocrisy, having
a conscience seared.</p>

<p>Blasphemers.</p>

<p>Mockers, walking according to
their own desires; animals, not having
the Spirit.</p>

<p>Mockers in deception, walking
according to their own lusts.</p>

<p><i>The second and third.</i>&mdash;Lovers of
themselves, lawless, proud, malicious,
traitors, froward, discourteous,
fearful, mockers in deception.</p>

<p><i>The fourth.</i>&mdash;Calumniators, cruel,
traitors.</p>

<p><i>The fifth.</i>&mdash;Mockers in deception.</p>

<p><i>The sixth.</i>&mdash;Traitors, without affection,
without peace.</p>

<p><i>The seventh.</i>&mdash;Traitors, walking
in impieties, walking according to
their own lusts, incontinent.</p>

<p><i>The eighth.</i>&mdash;Having their conscience
seared, without peace,
cruel.</p>

<p><i>The ninth.</i>&mdash;Spurning authority,
traitors, lawless, without peace.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind, moreover,
that these are not merely repulsive
infirmities of individuals,
but the essential and inevitable
characteristics deliberately adopted
by the craft of Freemasons, and
which it cannot be without, if they
are the brand which the finger of
God has marked upon the loathsome
brow of the Antichrist of “the last
time.”<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>In illustration of the former of
these we quote the words of Brother
Gotthold Salomon, D.Ph., preacher
at the new Synagogue at Hamburg,
member of the lodge entitled “The
Dawn in the East,” in Frankfort-on-Main,
who thus writes in his
<cite>Stimmen aus Osten</cite>, MSS. for the
brethren: “Why is there not a
trace of anything appertaining to
the Christian Church to be found
in the whole ritual of Freemasonry?
Why is not the name of Jesus once
mentioned, either in the oath administered,
or in the prayers on
the opening of the lodges, or at
the Masonic banquets? Why do
Masons reckon time, not from the
birth of Christ, but from the creation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
of the world, as do the Jews?
Why does not Freemasonry make use
of a single Christian symbol? Why
have we the compasses, the triangle,
the hydrometer, instead of the cross
and other emblems of the Passion?
Why have wisdom, beauty, and
strength superseded the Christian
triad of faith, hope, and charity?”<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Brother Jochmus Müller, president
of the late German-Catholic
Church at Berlin, says in his <cite>Kirchenreform</cite>
(vol. iii. p. 228): “We
have more in common with a free-thinking,
honest paganism than
with a narrow-minded Christianity.”<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>In the Waarscherwing (vol. xi.
Nos. 2 and 8) we find the following:</p>

<p>“The laws of the Mosaic and
Christian religions are the contemptible
inventions of petty minds bent
on deceiving others; they are the
most extravagant aberrations of the
human intellect.</p>

<p>“The selfishness of priests and
the despotism of the great have for
centuries upheld this system (Christianity),
since it enabled them to
rule mankind with a rod of iron by
means <em>of its rigid code of morality</em>,
and to confirm their power over
weak minds by means of certain
oracular utterances, in reality the
product of their own invention, but
palmed off on the world as the
words of revelation.”<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>In a review of Kirchenlehre and
Ketzerglaube by Dr. A. Drechsler
in vol. iv. of the <cite>Latomia</cite>, we find:
“The last efforts made to uphold
ecclesiastical Christianity occasioned
its complete expulsion from the
realm of reason; for they proved
but too plainly that all negotiations
for peace must result in failure.
Human reason became aware of
the irreconcilable enmity existing
between its own teachings and the
dogmas of the church.”</p>

<p>At a congress of Masons held at
a villa near Locarno, in the district
of Novara, preparatory to a socialistic
demonstration to be held in
the Colosseum at Rome, in answer
to the sapient question, “What new
form of worship is to supersede Catholicism?”
the equally sapient answer
was returned, “Communist principles
with a new religious ideal.”</p>

<p>From a document published, the
author of <cite>Secret Warfare of Freemasonry</cite>
tells us,<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> by the Orient of
Brussels, “to the greater glory of
the Supreme Architect of the world,
in the year of <em>true light</em> 5838”
(1838), we quote the following:</p>

<p>“1. That at the head of every
document issued by the brethren,
in an individual or corporate capacity,
should stand a profession
of faith in our lawgiver Jesus, the
son of Mary Amram (the Josue of
the Old Testament), the invariable
formula to be employed being, ‘To
the glory of the Great Architect of
the Universe,’ … to expose and
oppose the errors of pope and priest,
who commence everything in the
name of their Trinity.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“3. That in remembrance of the
Last Supper or Christian love-feast
of Jesus, the Son of Mary Amram,
an account of which is given in the
Arabic traditions and in the Koran,
a solemn festival should be held,
accompanied by a distribution of
bread, in commemoration of an ancient
custom observed by the slaves
of eating bread together, and of
their deliverance by means of the
liberator (Josue). The distribution
is to be accompanied by these
memorable words: ‘This is the
bread of misery and oppression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
which our fathers were forced to
eat under the Pharaos, the priests
of Juda; whosoever hungers, let
him come and eat; this is the Paschal
sacrifice; come unto us, all you
who are oppressed; yet this one
year more in Babylon, and the next
year shall see us free men!’ This
instructive, and at the same time
commemorative, supper of the
Rosicrucians is the counterpart of
the Supper of the Papists.”</p>

<p>Dr. Dupuy, indeed, informs us
of the corrupt portion of the Order
of Templars, that “Receptores dicebant
illis quos recipiebant, Christum
non esse verum Deum, et ipsum
fuisse falsum, non fuisse passum
pro redemptione humani generis, sed
pro sceleribus suis”&mdash;“They who
received said to those whom they
received that Christ was not really
God; that he was himself false, and
did not suffer for the redemption
of the human race, but for his own
crimes.”</p>

<p>In harmony with all this was the
offensively blasphemous utterance
of Mr. Frothingham at the Masonic
hall in this city some weeks ago, at
which the New York <cite>Tablet</cite> expressed
a just indignation&mdash;an indignation
which must have been shared by
all who believe, in any way or form,
in Jesus Christ, Redeemer of the
world: “Tom Paine has keyed my
moral being up to a higher note
than the Jesus of Nazareth.”</p>

<p>The argument we have advanced
seems to us to be convincing
enough as it stands. Could we
have taken a historical survey of
the μυστήριον τῆς ανομίας in the
two hemispheres from the “apostasy”
up to the present time, but especially
during the last fifteen years,
it would have acquired the force of a
logical demonstration. The limits
to which we are necessarily restrained
in a monthly periodical
put this completely out of our
power. Whoever he may be who
has intelligently appreciated the
political events of the latter period
will be able to supply the deficiency
for himself. Merely hinting, therefore,
at the impossibility of getting
anti-Freemason appreciations of
contemporary events before the
public&mdash;well known to all whose
position has invited them to that
duty&mdash;as an illustration of the plan
of action laid down in the second
clause of the above summary; at
the recent unconcealed advocacy of
the “craft” by the New York <cite>Herald</cite>,
and the more cautious conversion
of the London Times,<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> of that in
the third; at the ribaldry of the
press under Freemason influence directed
against the bishops, clergy,
and prominent laymen, as well as
against the Pope; the nicknames
they are for ever coining, such
as “clericals,” “ultramontanes,”
“retrogrades,” “reactionists”; their
blasphemous travesties of the solemnities
of religion in theatres
and places of public resort, and
so on, of that in the fourth and
fifth; at the world-wide effort to
induce states to exclude religious
influences from the education of
youth, of that of the sixth; at Victor
Emanuel, the Prince of Wales,
etc., of that of the seventh; at the
assassination of Count Rossi at the
beginning of the present Pope’s
reign, the quite recent assassination
of the President of Ecuador, the
repeated attempts at assassination
of Napoleon III., the deposition
of so many sovereigns, even of the
Pope himself&mdash;so far as it was in
their power to depose him&mdash;of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of the eighth; and at the whole
area of Europe strewn with the
wreck of revolution, of that of the
ninth; we pass on to the last two
marks of Antichrist with which we
brand the Freemason confraternity&mdash;<i lang="la">Qui
solvit Jesum</i> (Who abolishes
Christ) and <i lang="la">Qui adversatur et extollitur
supra omne quod dicitur Deus,
aut quod colitur, ita ut in templo
Dei sedeat ostendens se tanquam sit
Deus</i> (Who opposes himself to,
and raises himself above, all that is
called God, or is worshipped, so
that he may sit in the temple of
God, making himself out to be, as
it were, God).</p>

<p>Barruel, who was completely versed
in Freemasonry, and who had
been himself a Mason, states (p.
222) that “the grade of Kadosch
is the soul of Freemasonry, and the
final object of its plots is the reintroduction
of absolute liberty and
equality through the destruction
of all royalty and the abrogation
of all religious worship.” And he
backs this statement by a tragic incident
in the history of a friend of
his, who, because he was a Rosicrucian,
fancied himself to be “in possession
of the entire secret of Freemasonry.”
It is too long to admit
of our quoting it. The reader
anxious for information we refer to
<cite>The Secret Warfare of Freemasonry</cite>
(pp. 142-144).</p>

<p><cite>Le Libertaire</cite>, a New York paper, in
the interests of Freemasonry, about
the year 1858 had the following:
“As far as religion is concerned,
the <cite>Libertaire</cite> has none at all; he
protests against every creed; he
is an atheist and materialist, openly
denying the existence of God and
of the soul.”</p>

<p>In 1793 belief in God was a
crime prohibited in France under
pain of death.</p>

<p>Those of our readers who have
some acquaintance with modern
philosophy we need here only remind
of the <i lang="la">natura naturans</i> and
<i lang="la">natura naturata</i> of Spinoza, born
a Jew, but expelled from the synagogue
for his advocacy of these
principles of Freemasonry: “The
desire to find truth is a noble impulse,
the search after it a sacred
avocation; and ample field for this
is offered by both the mysterious
rites peculiar to the craft and those
of the Goddess Isis, adored in our
temples as the wisest and fairest of
deities.”&mdash;<cite>Vienna Freemason’s Journal</cite>
(3d year, No. 4, p. 78 et seq.)</p>

<p>In the <cite>Rappel</cite>, a French organ of
Freemasonry, was the following passage
a few weeks ago: “God is
nothing but a creation of the human
mind. In a word, God is the
ideal. If I am accused of being
an atheist, I should reply I prefer
to be an atheist, and have of God
an idea worthy of him, to being a
spiritualist and make of God a
being impossible and absurd.”</p>

<p>In short, the craft is so far advanced
in its course of triumph as
to have at length succeeded in familiarizing
the public ear with the
denial of the existence of a God;
so that it is now admitted as one
amongst the “open questions” of
philosophy.</p>

<p>Our illustration of the crowning
indications of the satanic mark of
Antichrist afforded by the Freemasons&mdash;the
sitting in the temple of
God, so as to make himself out
to be, as it were, God&mdash;will be short
but decisive.</p>

<p>The well-known passage in the
last work of the late Dr. Strauss, to
the effect that any worship paid to
a supposed divine being is an outrage
on <em>the dignity of human nature</em>,
goes far enough, we should have
thought, in this direction; but they
go beyond even this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>A Dutch Mason, N. J. Mouthan,
in a work entitled <cite>Naa een werknur
in’t Middenvertrek Losse Bladzijde;
Zaarboekje voor Nederlandsche Vrijmetselaren</cite>
(5872, p. 187 et seq.),
says: “The spirit which animates
us is an eternal spirit; it knows no
division of time or individual existence.
A sacred unity pervades
the wide firmament of heaven; it is
our one calling, our one duty, our
one God. Yes, we are God! We
ourselves are God!”</p>

<p>In the Freemasons’ periodical
“for circulation amongst the brethren”
(Altenberg, 1823, vol. i., No.
1) is the following: “The idea of
religion indirectly includes all men
as men; but in order to comprehend
this aright, a certain degree
of education is necessary, and unfortunately
the overweening egoism
of the educated classes prevents
their taking in so sublime a conception
of mankind. For this reason
our temples consecrated to
the <em>worship of humanity</em> can as
yet be opened only to a few.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> We
should, indeed, expose ourselves to
a charge of idolatry, were we to attempt
to personify the moral idea
of humanity in the way in which
divinity is usually personified.…
On this account, therefore,
it is advisable not to reveal
the cultus of humanity to the eyes
of the uninitiated, until at length the
time shall come when, from east to
west, this lofty conception of humanity
shall find a place in every
breast, this worship shall alone prevail,
and all mankind shall be gathered
into one fold and one family.”</p>

<p>The principles of this united
family, “seated in the temple of
God,” the Masonic philosopher Helvetius
expounds to us; from whom
we learn that “whatever is beneficial
to all in general may be called
virtue; what is prejudicial, vice
and sin. Here the voice of interest
has alone to speak.…
Passions are only the intensified expression
of self-interest in the individual;
witness the Dutch people,
who, when hatred and revenge
urged them to action, achieved
great triumphs, and made their
country a powerful and glorious
name. And as sensual love is
universally acknowledged to afford
happiness, purity must be condemned
as pernicious, the marriage
bond done away with, and children
declared to be the property of the
state.”<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The father of such a
“one fold and one family” no one
not himself signed with the “mark
of the beast” could hesitate to point
out. The consummation above
anticipated we are bid to expect.
Nor is it now far off. They who
are not “deceived” have, however,
the consoling assurance that
<em>our</em> Lord will “slay him with the
spirit of his mouth, and destroy
him with the illumination of his
coming.”</p>

<h3>SIR THOMAS MORE.<br />
<i>A HISTORICAL ROMANCE.</i></h3>

<p class="center">FROM THE FRENCH OF THE PRINCESSE DE CRAON.</p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p>“You understand, M. de Soria,”
said Wolsey to one of his secretaries,
in whom he placed the greatest confidence.
“As soon as you see him,
present yourself before him, give
the usual password, and then conduct
him through the subterranean
passage that leads to the banks of
the Thames. Bring him here by
the secret stairway. He will be
dressed in a cloak and suit of brown
clothes, wearing a black felt hat tied
round with a red ribbon.”</p>

<p>“My lord, you may feel perfectly
satisfied,” replied the secretary with
a self-sufficient air, “that all your
orders will be punctually executed.
But he cannot possibly arrive for
an hour yet; I will vouch for that,
my lord.”</p>

<p>“Go, however, sir,” replied the
minister, impatiently; “I fear being
taken by surprise. Have less
confidence in your own calculations,
sir, and be more prompt in your
actions.” And saying this he made a
sign for him to go at once.</p>

<p>The door had scarcely closed on
Soria, when the cardinal, who sat
writing in silence, heard in the court
of the chancellor’s palace an unusual
noise. For some time he continued
his work; but the tumult increasing,
and hearing loud bursts of
laughter, he arose, opened the window
and went out on a high balcony,
whence he had a view of all
that was passing in the principal
court.</p>

<p>There a crowd of servants had
assembled, and formed a circle
around an old woman who was
apparently the object of their ridicule.
Her large felt hat, around
which was tied a band of red ribbon,
had fallen to the ground leaving
uncovered, not the head of an
old woman, as they had supposed,
but one thickly covered with short
hair, black and curling.</p>

<p>On seeing this head-dress the
crowd redoubled their cries, and
one of them advancing suddenly,
raised the mask concealing the features.
What was their surprise to
find under that disguise a great
rubicund face, the nose and cheeks
of which were reddened with the
glow that wine and strong drink
alone produce, and giving sufficient
evidence of the sex to which it belonged.
The man, seeing he was
discovered, defended himself with
vigor, and, dealing sharp blows with
his feet and hands, endeavored to
escape from his tormentors; but he
was unable to resist their superior
numbers. They threw themselves
upon him, tearing off his brown
cloak, and one of his blue cotton
petticoats. The wretched creature
cried out vociferously, loudly
threatening them with the indignation
of the cardinal; but the valets
heard nothing, vain were all his efforts
to escape them. Nevertheless,
being exceedingly robust, he at
length succeeded in overthrowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
two of his antagonists, and then,
dashing across the courtyard, he
sprang quickly into the second
court, where, finding a ladder placed
at the window of a granary, he
clambered up with all the dexterity
of a frightened cat, and hid himself
under a quantity of straw which
had been stored there. In the
meantime, the cardinal had recognized
from his elevated position on
the balcony the red ribbon that
announced the messenger for whom
he awaited with so much anxiety.
Greatly enraged at the scene before
him, and forgetting his dignity, he
hurried from the balcony, rushing
through the apartments that
led from his own room (in which
were seated the numerous secretaries
of state, engaged in the work of
the government). Without addressing
a word to them, he descended
the stairs so rapidly that in another
instant he stood in the midst of
his servants, who were stupefied at
finding themselves in the presence
of their master, all out of breath,
bareheaded, and almost suffocated
with indignation. He commanded
them in the most emphatic
terms to get out of his sight, which
they did without waiting for a repetition
of the order. From every
direction the pages and secretaries
had assembled, among them being
M. de Soria, who was in great trepidation,
fearing some accident had
happened to the individual whom
he had been instructed to introduce
with such great secrecy into the palace.
His fears were more than
realized on seeing the cardinal, who
cast on him a glance of intense anger,
and in a loud voice exclaimed:
“Go, sir, to the assistance of this unfortunate
man who is being subjected
to such outrages in my own house.
Not a few of those who have attempted
to drive him off shall
themselves be sent away!” Then the
cardinal, giving an authoritative
signal, those around him understood
that their presence was no longer
desired, and immediately ascended
the stairs and returned to their
work.</p>

<p>Wolsey himself quickly followed
them; and M. de Soria, greatly
confused, in a short time appeared
and ushered into the minister’s cabinet
the messenger, who was still
suffering from the effects of the contest
in which he had been compelled
to engage.</p>

<p>“Your letters! your letters!”
said Wolsey eagerly, as soon as they
were alone. “All is right, Wilson.
I am satisfied. I see that you are
no coward, and all that you have
just now suffered will be turned to
your advantage. Nevertheless, it is
quite fortunate that I came to your
rescue when I did, for I really do
not know what those knaves might
have done to you.”</p>

<p>“They would have thrown me
into the water, I believe, like a
dog,” said Wilson, laughing. “Oh!
that was nothing though. I have
been through worse than that in
my life. All I was afraid of was,
that they might discover the package
of letters and the money.”</p>

<p>As he said this, the courier proceeded
to unfasten the buckles of
an undervest, made of chamois
leather, that he wore closely strapped
around his body. After he
had taken off the vest he unfastened
a number of bands of woollen
cloth which were crossed on his
breast. In each one of these
bands was folded a great number
of letters, of different forms and
sizes. Then he unstrapped from
his waist and laid on the table a
belt that contained quite a large
sum of money in gold coin, that
Francis I. had sent to the minister.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
The avarice of Wolsey was so well
understood by the different princes
and sovereigns of Europe that they
were accustomed to send him valuable
presents, or to confer on him
rich annuities, whenever they wished
to gain him over to their interests.
Wolsey had for a long time
been engaged in a correspondence
with France. He carried it on
with the utmost secrecy, for he well
understood if discovered by Henry
he would never be pardoned.
His apprehensions were still greater,
now that he was endeavoring to
direct the influence of his political
schemes, and that of the paid
agents whom he had at the different
courts of Europe, towards
bringing about a reconciliation between
the Emperor Charles V.
and the King of France; hoping
by such an alliance to prevent the
marriage of the king with Anne
Boleyn, and thus to destroy the
hopes of that ambitious family.
He saw with intense satisfaction
his intrigues succeeding far beyond
his most sanguine expectations.</p>

<p>Francis I. anxiously entreated
him to use his influence with the
King of England, in order to dispose
him favorably toward the
treaty of peace which he was determined
to make with Charles
V. “I assure you,” he wrote,
“that I have so great a desire to
see my children, held so long now
as hostages, that I would without
hesitation willingly give the half
of my kingdom to ensure that happiness.
If you will aid me in removing
the obstacles that Henry
may interpose to the accomplishment
of this purpose, you may
count on my gratitude. The place
of meeting is already arranged; we
have chosen the city of Cambrai;
and I have felt great pleasure in
the assurance that you prefer, above
all other places, that the conference
should be held in that city.”
Charmed with his success, the cardinal
sent immediately in quest of
Cromwell, whom he found every
day becoming more and more indispensable
to him, and to whom
he wished to communicate the happiness
he experienced in receiving
this joyful intelligence; but, at the
same time, closely concealing the
manner in which he had obtained
the information.</p>

<p class="break">On a terrace of Windsor Castle
a tent had been erected of heavy
Persian cloth interwoven with silk
and gold. Voluminous curtains
of royal purple, artistically looped
on each side with heavy silk cords,
descended in innumerable folds of
most graceful drapery. Rare flowers
embalmed the air in every direction
with exquisite perfumes,
which penetrated into an apartment
of the royal palace, through
the open windows of which were
seen the richness and elegance of
the interior.</p>

<p>In this apartment were seated
three persons apparently engaged
in an animated conversation.</p>

<p>“So there is yet another difficulty!”
cried a young girl, a charming
and beautiful blonde, who
seemed at this moment in an extremely
impatient and excited
mood. “But what say you?” she
added presently, addressing herself
with vivacity to a gentleman
seated immediately in front of her;
“speak now, Sir Cromwell; say,
what would you do in this desperate
situation? Is there no way in
which we can prevent this treaty
from being concluded?”</p>

<p>“Well truly, madam,” he replied,
“it will be useless to attempt it. The
Duchess of Angoulême has at this
moment, perhaps, already arrived at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Cambrai, for the purpose of signing
the treaty; and we cannot reasonably
hope that the Archduchess
Margaret, who accompanies her,
will not agree with her on every
point, since the preliminaries have
already been secretly concluded
between the Emperor and the
King of France.”</p>

<p>“Well, my dear Cromwell,” she
replied, in a familiar and angry
tone, “what shall we do then?”</p>

<p>“If I have any counsel to give
you, madam,” answered Cromwell,
with an air of importance, “it is
to begin by preventing the king
from consenting to the departure
of Cardinal Wolsey; because his
greatest desire now is to be sent
as envoy to the congress at Cambrai,
and you may be well assured,
if he wishes to go there, it is certainly
not with the intention of being
useful to you, but, on the contrary,
to injure you.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so?” replied Lady
Anne. “Then I shall most certainly
endeavor to prevent him
from making his appearance there.
But has he told you nothing about
the letter I wrote him the other
day?”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, madam,” replied
Cromwell, “he has shown me the
letter; in fact, he conceals nothing
from me.”</p>

<p>“Well! and did it not give him
pleasure? It seemed to me it
ought to please him, for I made
protestations of friendship sufficient
to reassure him, and remove all
apprehensions he may have felt
that I would injure him in the estimation
of the king.”</p>

<p>“He has said nothing to me
on the subject,” replied Cromwell,
“but I remarked that he read the
letter over several times, and when
he handed it to me it was with a very
ominous shake of the head. Understanding
so well his every gesture
and thought, I comprehended
perfectly he was but little convinced
of what you had written, and
that he has no confidence in it.
Moreover, madam, it is necessary
that you should know that Wolsey
has been most active in his endeavors
to forward the divorce so long
as he believed the king would espouse
a princess of the house of
France; but since he knows it is
<em>you</em> he has chosen, his mind is entirely
changed, and he tries in every
possible manner to retard the decision
and render success impossible.”</p>

<p>“It is clear as day, my dear sister!”
exclaimed Lord Rochford,
earnestly interrupting Cromwell.
“You know nothing about the affairs
you are trying to manage;
therefore you will never be able
to rid yourself of this imperious
minister. I have already told you
that all your efforts to flatter or
appease him will be in vain. He
believes you fear him, and he likes
you no better on that account.
What Cromwell says is but too
true, and is verified by the fact
that nothing advances in this affair.
Every day some new formalities
are introduced, or advantages
claimed, or they wait for new instructions
and powers. They tell us
constantly that Campeggio is inflexible;
that nothing will induce him
to deviate from his instructions
and the usages of the court of
Rome. But whom has he chosen&mdash;with
whom has he conferred?
Is it not Wolsey? And he has
certainly prevented us from obtaining
anything but what he himself
designed to accomplish.”</p>

<p>“You are right, brother!” cried
Anne Boleyn, with a sudden gesture
of displeasure. “It is necessary
to have this haughty and jealous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
minister removed. Henceforth
all my efforts shall be directed to
this end. It may, perhaps, be less
difficult than we suppose. The king
has been violently opposed to this
treaty, which Wolsey has so earnestly
labored to bring about&mdash;or
at least the king suspects him of it&mdash;and
he told me yesterday that it
was vain for the king of France to
address him as ‘his good brother
and perpetual ally,’ for he regarded
as enemies all who presumed to
oppose his will. ‘Because,’ he
added, ‘I understand very well, beforehand,
what their terms will be.
Once become the ally of Charles
V., Francis will use all his efforts to
prevent the repudiation of his aunt;
but nothing under heaven shall divert
me from my purpose. I will
resist all the counsels he may give
me!’”</p>

<p>“He is much disappointed,” said
Lord Rochford, “that the Pope
should have been raised, as it were,
from the dead. His death would
have greatly lessened these difficulties;
for he holds firmly to his opinions.
I am much deceived, or the
commission of legates will pass
all their time, and a very long time
too, without coming to any decision.”</p>

<p>As Lord Rochford made this remark,
his wife, the sister-in-law of
Anne Boleyn, entered the apartment,
accompanied by the young
wife of Lord Dacre. Now, as Lady
Rochford belonged entirely to the
queen’s adherents, and Lady Anne
was very much in fear of her, the
tone of conversation was immediately
changed, becoming at once general
and indifferent.</p>

<p>“The Bishop of Rochester has
returned to London,” carelessly remarked
Anne Boleyn, as she stooped
to pick up a little embroidered
glove.</p>

<p>“Yes, madam,” replied Cromwell.
“I have seen him, and I find
him looking quite old and feeble.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I am truly sorry to hear
it,” replied Lady Anne; “the king
is very much attached to him. I
have often heard him say he regarded
him as the most learned
and remarkable man in England,
and that he congratulated himself
on possessing in his kingdom a
prelate so wise, virtuous, and accomplished.”</p>

<p>“What would you wish, madam?”
replied Cromwell, who never could
suffer any one to be eulogized in
his presence; “all these old men
should give place to us&mdash;it is but
just; they have had their time.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Sir Cromwell,” replied
Lady Boleyn, smiling, “you have
no desire, I am sure, to be made
bishop; therefore, the place he will
leave vacant will not be the one for
you.”</p>

<p>“You have decided that question
very hastily, madam. Who
knows? I may one day, perhaps,
be a curate. It has been predicted
of me.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that would indeed be a
very strange sight,” she replied,
laughing aloud. “You certainly
have neither the turn nor the taste
for the office. How would you
ever manage to leave off the habit
of frequenting our drawing-rooms?
Truly we could not afford to lose
you, and would certainly get up a
general revolt, opposing your ordination,
rather than be deprived of
your invaluable society.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind, madam,”
said Cromwell; “but I should perhaps
not be so ridiculous as you
imagine. I should wear a grave
and severe countenance and an air
of the greatest austerity.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I understand you now,”
she replied; “you would not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
converted; you would only become
a hypocrite!”</p>

<p>“I have a horror of hypocrites!”
said Cromwell scornfully.</p>

<p>“I wonder what you are, then?”
thought Lady Rochford.</p>

<p>“And I also,” replied Lady Anne.
“I have a perfect detestation of
hypocrites; it is better to be bad
out and out!”</p>

<p>“Is it true there has been a riot
in the city?” asked Lady Rochford.</p>

<p>“Yes, madam,” replied Cromwell;
“but it was suppressed on
the spot. It was only a hundred
wool-spinners, carders, and
drapers, who declared they were
no longer able to live since the
market of the Netherlands has
been closed, and that they would
soon starve if their old communications
were not re-established.
The most mutinous were arrested,
the others were frightened and
quickly dispersed.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Lord Rochford,
“there is nothing to fear from
such a rabble as that; they are too
much afraid of their necks. Let
them clamor, and let us give ourselves
no uneasiness on the subject.
I met Sir Thomas More this morning
going to the king with a petition
which they had addressed to
him yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Why was he charged with the
commission?” asked young Lady
Dacre.</p>

<p>“In virtue of his office as sheriff
of the city,” replied Cromwell.</p>

<p>“He constitutes, then, part of
our city council?” she replied.
“He is a man I have the greatest
desire to know; they say such
marvellous things of him, and I
find his poetry full of charming
and noble thoughts.”</p>

<p>“I see,” replied Cromwell, “you
have not read the spirited satire
just written by Germain de Brie?
It points out the perfectly prodigious
faults of More’s productions.
It is certainly an <em>anti-Morus</em>!”</p>

<p>“I am inclined to think your
opinion is prompted by a spirit of
jealousy, Sir Cromwell,” answered
Lady Rochford, sharply. “Read,
madam,” she continued, addressing
young Lady Sophia Dacre, “his
<cite>History of Richard III.</cite>; I suppose
Sir Cromwell will, at least, accord
some merit to that work?”</p>

<p>“Entirely too light, and superficial
indeed, madam,” said Cromwell;
“the author has confined
himself wholly to a recital of the
crimes which conducted the prince
to the throne. The style of that
history is very negligent, but, at
the same time, very far above that
of his other works, and particularly
of his <cite>Utopia</cite>, which is a work
so extravagant, a political system
so impracticable, that I regard the
book simply as a wonderful fable,
agreeable enough to listen to, but
at which one is obliged to laugh
afterwards when thinking of the
absurdities it contains.”</p>

<p>“Your judgment is as invidious
as it is false!” exclaimed Lady
Rochford, who always expressed her
opinions bluntly, and without dissimulation.
“If it is true,” she
continued, “that this philosophical
dream can never be realized, yet it
is nevertheless impossible not to
admire the wise and virtuous maxims
it contains. Above all others
there is one I have found so just,
and so beautifully conceived, I
could wish every young girl capable
of teaching it to her future husband.
‘How can it be supposed,’
says the author, ‘that any man of
honor and refinement could resolve
to abandon a virtuous woman, who
had been the companion of his bosom,
and in whose society he had
passed so many days of happiness;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
only because time, at whose touch
all things fade, had laid his destroying
hand upon the lovely features
of that gentle wife, once so
cherished and adored? Because
age, which has been the first and
most incurable of all the infirmities
she has been compelled to drag
after her, had forcibly despoiled
her of the charming freshness of her
youth? Has that husband not enjoyed
the flower of her beauty and
garnered in the most beautiful days
of her life, and will he forsake his
wife now because she has become
feeble, delicate, and suffering?
Shall he become inconstant and
perjured at the very moment when
her sad condition demands of him
a thousand sacrifices, and claims a
return to the faithful devotion and
vows of his early youth? Ah!
into such a depth of unworthiness
and degradation we will not presume
it possible for any man to descend!
It was thus the people of
the Utopian Isle reasoned, declaring
it would be the height of injustice
and barbarity to abandon one
whom we had loved and cherished,
and who had been so devoted to
us, at the moment when suffering
and affliction demanded of us renewed
sympathy and a generous
increase of our tenderest care and
consolations!’<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> And now, my dear
sister,” she added, fixing her eyes
steadfastly on Lady Boleyn, “what
do you think of that passage?
Are you not forcibly struck by the
truth and justice of the sentiment?
Let me advise you when
you marry to be well satisfied beforehand
that your husband entertains
the same opinions.”</p>

<p>As she heard these last words
the beautiful face of Anne Boleyn
became suddenly suffused with a
deep crimson, and for some moments
not a word was uttered by
any one around her. They understood
perfectly well that Lady
Rochford’s remarks were intended
to condemn in the most pointed
manner the king’s conduct towards
the queen, whose failing health was
entirely attributable to the mortification
and suffering she endured
on account of her husband’s ingratitude
and ill-treatment.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the silence becoming
every moment more and
more embarrassing, Anne Boleyn,
forcibly assuming an air of gayety,
declared her sister was disposed to
look very far into the future; “but,”
she added, “happily, my dear sister,
neither you nor I are in a condition
to demand all those tender
cares due to age and infirmity.”</p>

<p>“Come, ladies, let us go,” said
Cromwell in a jesting tone, hoping
to render himself agreeable to
Lady Anne by relieving the embarrassment
the conversation had
caused her. “I am unable to express
my admiration for Lady
Rochford. She understands too
well the practice of the Utopian laws
not to wish for the position of
Dean of the Doctors of the University
of Oxford.”</p>

<p>“You are very complimentary
and jocose, sir,” replied Lady Rochford;
“and if you wish it, I will introduce
you to one who will be
personally necessary if you should
ever aspire to fill a position in that
kingdom. You must know, however,
that their wise law-giver, Utopia,
while he accorded to each one
liberty of conscience, confined that
liberty within legitimate and righteous
bounds, in order to prevent
the promulgation of the pernicious
doctrines of pretended philosophers,
who endeavor to debase
the dignity of our exalted human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
nature; he also severely condemned
every opinion tending to degenerate
into pure materialism, or,
what is more deplorable still, veritable
atheism. The Utopians were
taught to believe in the reality of a
future state, and in future rewards
and punishments. They detested
and denounced all who presumed
to deny these truths, and, far from admitting
them to the rank of citizens,
they refused even to class among
men those who debased themselves
to the abject condition of vile animals.
‘What,’ they asked, ‘can be
done with a creature devoid of
principle and without faith, whose
only restraint is fear of punishment,
who without that fear would violate
every law and trample under foot
those wise rules and regulations
which alone constitute the bulwark
of social order and happiness?
What confidence can be reposed in
an individual purely sensual, living
without morals and without hope,
recognizing no obligation but to
himself alone; who limits his happiness
to the present moment;
whose God is his body; whose law,
his own pleasures and passions, in
the gratification of which he is at
all times ready to proceed to the
extremity of crime, provided he can
find means of escaping the vigilant
eye of justice, and be a villain with
impunity? Such infamous characters
are of course excluded from all
participation in municipal affairs,
and all positions of honor and public
trust; they are veritable automatons,
abandoned to the “error of their
ways,” wretched, wandering “cumberers
of the earth” on which they
live!’ You perceive, Sir Cromwell,”
continued Lady Rochford
ironically, “that my profound
knowledge and retentive memory
may prove very useful to you,
should you ever arrive at the Utopian
Isle, for you must be convinced
that your own opinions would
meet with very little favor in that
country.”</p>

<p>Cromwell, humiliated to the last
degree, vainly endeavored to reply
with his usual audacity and
spirit. Finding all efforts to recover
his self-possession impossible, he
stammered forth a few incoherent
words, and hastily took his leave.</p>

<p>The desire of winning the approbation
of Anne Boleyn at the expense
of her sister-in-law had
caused him to commit a great blunder,
and he received nothing in return
to remove the caustic arrows
from his humiliated and deeply
wounded spirit. Extremely brilliant
and animated in conversation,
Lady Rochford was accustomed
to “having the laugh entirely
on her own side,” which,
knowing so very well, Anne had
pretended not to understand the
conversation, although the remarks
had been so very piquant.</p>

<p>As soon as he had retired Cromwell
became the subject of conversation,
and Anne timidly, and with
no little hesitation, ventured to remonstrate
with her sister-in-law,
expressing her regret that the conversation
should have been made
so personal, as she liked Cromwell
very much.</p>

<p>“And that is just what you are
wrong in doing,” replied Lady
Rochford; “for he is a deceitful
and dangerous man! He pretends
to be extremely devoted to you,
but it is only because he believes
he can make you useful to
himself; and he is full of avarice
and ambition. This you will discover
when it is perhaps too late,
and I advise you to reflect seriously
on the subject. It is so cruel to be
mistaken in the choice of a friend
that, truly, the surer and better way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
would seem to be, to form no friendships
at all! There are so few, so
very few, whose affections are pure
and disinterested, that they scarcely
ever withstand the ordeal of misfortune,
or the loss of those extraneous
advantages with which they
found us surrounded.”</p>

<p>“You speak like a book, my dear
sister,” cried Lady Boleyn, laughing
aloud; “just like a book that has
been sent me from France, with
such beautiful silver clasps.”</p>

<p>Saying this, she ran to fetch the
book, which she had opened that
evening in the middle, not having
sufficient curiosity to examine the
title or inquire the name of the
author of the volume. She opened
it naturally at the same place, and
read what follows, which was, as
far as could be discovered, the fragment
of a letter:</p>

<p>“You ask me for the definition of
a friend! In reply, I am compelled
to declare that the term has become
so vague and so obscure, it has been
used in so many senses, and applied
to so many persons, I shall first be
obliged to give you a description of
what is called a friend in the world&mdash;a
title equivalent, in my estimation, to
the most complete indifference, intermingled
at the same time with no insignificant
degree of envy and jealousy.
For instance, I hear M. de
Clèves speaking of his friend M. Joyeuse,
and he remarks simply: ‘I
know more about him than anybody
else; I have been his most intimate
friend for a great many years; he
is meanly avaricious&mdash;I have reproached
him for it a hundred times.’
A little further on, and I hear the
great Prof. de Chaumont exclaim,
‘Valentino d’Alsinois is a
most charming woman; everybody
is devoted to her. But this popularity
cannot last long&mdash;she is full
of vanity; intolerably conceited and
silly; it really amuses me!’ I go
on still further, and meet a friend
who takes me enthusiastically by
both hands: ‘Oh! I expected a
visit from you yesterday, and was
quite in despair that you did not
come! You know how delighted I
always am to see you, and how
highly I appreciate your visits!’
But I happen to have very keen
eyes, and an ear extremely acute
and delicate; and I distinctly heard
her whisper to her friend as I approached
them, ‘How fortunate I
have been to escape this visit!’
What a change! I did not think it
could last long. Well, with friends
like these you will find the world
crowded; they will obstruct, so to
speak, every hour of your life; but
it is rare indeed to encounter one
who is true and loyal, a friend of
the heart! A man truly virtuous:
and sincerely religious is alone capable
of comprehending and loving
with pure and exalted friendship.
A man of the world, on
the contrary, accustomed to refer
everything to himself, and consulting
his own desires, becomes his
own idol, and on the altar of <em>self</em>
offers up the only sincere worship
of which his sordid soul is capable.
And you will find he will always
end by sacrificing to his own interests
and passions the dearest interests
of the being who confided in
his friendship.</p>

<p>“But with the sincere and earnest
friend, love and gratitude are
necessities of his nature; they constitute
the unbroken chain which
links all pure and reasonable friendship.
He will assist his friend in all
emergencies, for he has assumed in
a manner even his responsibilities.
He will never flatter; his counsel
and advice, on the contrary, may be
severely administered, because it is
impossible to be happy without being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
virtuous, and the happiness of
his friend is as dear to him as his
own. He is ready to sacrifice his
own interests to those of his friend,
and none would dare attack his
friend’s reputation in his presence;
for they know he will defend and
sustain him under all circumstances,
sympathizing in his misfortunes,
mingling tears with his tears&mdash;in a
word, that it is another self whom
they would presume to attack.</p>

<p>“Death itself cannot dissolve the
ties of such an affection&mdash;the soul,
nearer to God, will continue to implore
unceasingly for him the divine
benediction. Oh! what joy,
what happiness, to participate in a
friendship so pure and exalted!
He who can claim one such friend
possesses a source of unbounded
joy, and an inexhaustible consolation
of which cruel adversity
can never deprive him. If prosperity
dazzles him with its dangerous
splendor, if sorrow pierce
him with her dart, if melancholy
annihilate the life of his soul, then
ever near him abides this friend,
like a precious gift which God
alone had power to bestow!”</p>

<p class="break">Queen Catherine was walking in
that portion of the vast grounds
of Greenwich called the Queen’s
Garden, which in happier days had
often been her favorite retreat.
Jets of limpid water (conveyed
by means of pipes through the
grounds) burst in every direction,
and then fell in silvery showers
among the lovely parterres of flowers,
and covered the green velvet
turf with a glittering veil of diamond-like
spray. On the bosom
of the murmuring waters floated
myriads of leaves and flowers,
flung with gentle hand by the
wooing breeze, while thousands of
gold fishes sported amid their crystal
depths. The eye of the stranger
was at once arrested and ravished
by these marvels of nature and
art, admiring the power and riches
thus united; but the queen, with
slow and painful steps, only sought
this solitude for liberty there to indulge
her tears in silence and oblivion.</p>

<p>At no great distance Mary, full
of joy, engaged in the sportive
plays of the ladies of the queen.
A golden insect or a brilliant butterfly
was the only conquest to
which she aspired. Gaily flitting
from place to place, with step so
light that her little feet scarcely
impressed the delicate white sand
covering the walks, her shouts of
expectation and happiness were still
powerless to rejoice the maternal
heart.</p>

<p>Catherine hastily withdrew from
the scene. Fatigued and worn
with suffering, she regarded with
painful indifference all that surrounded
her.</p>

<p>In the meantime one of the gardeners
advanced towards her and
presented a bouquet.</p>

<p>“Give it,” said she, “to one of
my ladies.” And she turned away;
but the gardener would not withdraw.
“The queen does not recognize
me,” he said at length in a
low voice.</p>

<p>“Ah! More,” exclaimed Catherine,
greatly agitated. “Friend always
faithful! But why expose
yourself thus to serve me? Go
on. I will follow!” And Catherine
continued her walk until she
reached a wide and extended avenue
planted with venerable old lindens.</p>

<p>“More,” she exclaimed, trembling
with fear, yet still indulging a
slight hope, “what have you to
tell me? Speak, oh! speak quickly!
I fear we may be observed;
every step of mine is watched.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“Madam,” cried More, “a general
peace has been concluded.
The emperor’s difficulty with the
Holy See is ended; he consents to
surrender all the conquered territory
originally belonging to the
Ecclesiastical States. He binds
himself to re-establish the dominion
of the Medici in Florence; he
abandons Sforza, leaving the Pope
absolute master of the destiny of
that prince and the sovereignty of
the Milanese. Urged on by these
concessions, the two princesses cut
short their negotiations, and the
treaty between France and Austria
was concluded immediately. Your
appeal and protestation have been
despatched, and conveyed safely out
of the kingdom. The messenger
to whom they were entrusted was
most rigorously searched, but the
papers were so securely and adroitly
concealed they were not discovered.
They were carried to Antwerp
by Peter Gilles, the ‘friend
of my heart,’ and from thence he
despatched them to Rome. Hope,
therefore hope; let us all hope!”</p>

<p>“Ah! More,” replied the queen,
who had listened with deep anxiety,
“would that I were able to
acknowledge your services as I appreciate
them. Your friendship
has been my only consolation.
But I know not why it is, hope
every day grows more and more
faint in my heart. And so utterly
insensible to joy have I become
that it seems now I am incapable
of aught but suffering, and that for
me I fear greater sorrow is to be
added.”</p>

<p>“What do you say, madam?”
replied More. “How sadly discouraging
and painful to your servants
to hear such reflections from
you at the very moment when
everything becomes favorable to
your cause. The emperor will
use his influence at the court of
Rome, and Francis, between the
two allies, will at least be forced to
remain neutral.”</p>

<p>“What were the conditions of
the Treaty of Cambrai?” asked the
queen.</p>

<p>“They were very hard and exacting,”
replied More. “The king
of France entirely renounces his
pretensions to Burgundy and Italy;
thus nine years of war, the battle
of Pavia, and a humiliating captivity,
become of no avail. He
sacrifices all, even his allies. Fearing
to add to these harsh conditions
the reconciliation of their interests,
he abandoned to the mercy
of the emperor, without the slightest
stipulation, the Venetians, the
Florentines, the Duke of Ferrara,
and the Neapolitan barons who
were attached to his arms.”</p>

<p>“What a cruel error!” exclaimed
the queen. “The prince has surely
forgotten that even in political
and state affairs, he who once sacrifices
his friends cannot hope to
recall them ever again to his support.
It is very evident that he
has not more prudent nor wise
counsellors in his cabinet than
skilful and accomplished generals
in the field. Who now among
them all can be compared with
Pescaire, Anthony de Lêve, or the
Prince of Orange?”</p>

<p>“He might have had them, madam,
if his own negligence and the
wickedness of his courtiers had not
alienated and driven them away.
The Constable of Bourbon, Moran,
and Doria would have powerfully
counterbalanced the talents and influence
of the chiefs you have just
named, had the king of France engaged
them in his own cause, instead
of having to encounter them
in the ranks of his enemies. His
undaunted courage and personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
valor, however, have alone caused
the unequal and hopeless contest to
be so long continued.”</p>

<p>“And what does your king say
of these affairs?” asked the queen,
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Alas! madam, he seems but
little satisfied,” responded More,
hesitating.</p>

<p>“That is just as I suspected,”
replied the queen. “Yes, it is because
he foresees new obstacles to
the unjust divorce he is prosecuting
with so much ardor. O More!”
she continued, bursting into tears,
“what have I done to merit such
cruel treatment? When I look
back on the happy years of my
youth, the years when he loved me
so tenderly; when I recall the devoted
and affectionate demonstrations
of those days, and compare
them with the actual rudeness
and severity of the present, my
bleeding heart is crushed by this
sorrow! What have I done, More,
to lose thus so suddenly and entirely
my husband’s affection? It
is true, the freshness of my early
youth has faded, but was it to such
ephemeral advantages alone I owed
his devotion? Can a marriage be
contracted by a man with the intention
of dissolving it as soon as
the personal attractions, the youthful
charms, of his wife have faded?
Oh! it seems to me it should be
just the contrary, and that the hour
of affliction should only call forth
deeper proofs of affection. No,
More, no! neither you nor any
other of my friends will be able to
accomplish anything for me. I feel
that my life is rapidly ebbing away;
that my spirit is crushed and broken
for ever. For admitting, even,
that Henry will not be successful in
his attempt to sever the sacred
bonds of our union, what happiness
could I ever hope to enjoy near one
to whom I had become an object
of aversion&mdash;who would behold in
me only an invincible obstacle to
his will and the gratification of his
criminal and disorderly passions?”</p>

<p>“Alas! madam,” replied More,
“we are all grieved at the contemplation
of the great affliction by
which you are overwhelmed, and
how much do we wish the expression
of our sympathy and devotion
had power to relieve you. But remember
the Princess of Wales&mdash;you
will surely never cease to defend
her rights.”</p>

<p>“Never, never!” exclaimed the
queen passionately. “That is the
sole inducement I have once more
to arouse myself&mdash;it sustains my
courage and animates my resolution,
when health and spirits both
fail. O More! could you but
know all that passes in the depths
of my soul; could you but realize,
for one moment, the anguish and
agony, the deep interior humiliation,
into which I am plunged!
Oh! fatal and for ever unfortunate
day when I left my country and
the royal house of my father! Why
was I not born in obscurity? Would
not my life then have passed quietly
and without regret? Far from the
tumult of the world and the éclat
of thrones, I should have been extremely
happy. Now I am dying
broken-hearted and unknown.”</p>

<p>“Is it really yourself, madam,”
answered More, “who thus gives
way to such weakness? Truly, it is
unworthy of your rank, and still
more of your virtues. When adversity
overtakes us, we should summon
all our courage and resolution. You
are our queen, and you should remember
your daughter is born sovereign
of this realm, beneath whose
soil our buried forefathers sleep.
No, no! Heaven will never permit
the blood of such a race to be sullied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
by that of an ambitious and degraded
woman. That noble race
will triumph, be assured of it; and
in that triumph the honor of our
country will shine forth with renewed
glory and splendor. I swear
it by my head, and hope it in my
heart!” As he said these words,
footsteps were heard, and Catherine
perceived the king coming towards
them. She turned instantly pale,
but, remaining calm in the dangerous
crisis, made a sign for More to
withdraw. The king immediately
approached her, and, observing with
heartless indifference the traces of
recent tears on her cheek, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Always in tears!” Then, assuming
a playful manner, he continued:
“Come, Kate, you must confess that
you are always singularly sad and
depressed, and the walls of a convent
would suit you much better
than this beautiful garden. You
have in your hand a fine bouquet;
I see at least you still love flowers.”</p>

<p>“I do indeed,” replied the queen,
with a deep sigh.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Henry, “I do not
mean to reproach you, but it would
be advisable not to hold those
roses so close to your cheek; the
contrast might be unfavorable&mdash;is
it not so, my old Kate? Have you
seen the falcons just sent me from
Scotland? They are of a very rare
species, and trained to perfection.
I am going out now to try them.”</p>

<p>“I wish your majesty a pleasant
morning,” answered the queen.</p>

<p>“Adieu, Kate,” he continued,
proceeding on his way, and giving
in the exuberance of his spirits a
flourish with his trumpet. Very
soon the notes of the hunting-horns
announced his arrival in the outer
courtyard. He found there assembled
a crowd of lords and pages,
followed by falconers, carrying the
new birds on their wrists. These
birds were fettered, and wore on
their heads little leathern hoods,
which were to be removed at the
moment they mounted in the air in
search of their accustomed prey.</p>

<p>In a very short time the party
rode off, and Catherine thoughtfully
entered the palace, thinking it
was a long time since the king had
shown himself so indulgent and
gracious towards her.</p>

<p class="break">“Are you well assured of the
truth of these statements?” said
the king, returning Cromwell a letter
he had just read. “No! I will
not believe it,” he cried, stamping
his foot violently on the richly-tessellated
floor of his cabinet. “I
certainly hoped to have gained the
legate over.”</p>

<p>“But your majesty may no longer
indulge in this illusion,” replied
Cromwell, who stood before the
king in an attitude the most humble
and servile possible to assume.
“You are furnished with incontrovertible
proof; Campeggio, in order
to escape your imperious commands,
urges the Pope to evoke the
trial to his own tribunal. Of this
there is no doubt, for this copy of
his letter I received from the hand
of his confidential secretary.”</p>

<p>“You are very adroit, sir,” replied
the king, haughtily. “Later,
I will consider the manner of
rewarding you. But I declare
to you your patron is on the
brink of ruin. I shall never pardon
him for permitting that protest
and appeal of the queen to reach
Rome.”</p>

<p>“That was truly an unfortunate
affair,” replied Cromwell; “but it
was perhaps not the fault of my
lord, Cardinal Wolsey.”</p>

<p>“Whose fault was it then?” demanded
Henry in the imperious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
tone he used to disconcert this spy
whenever his reports displeased
him.</p>

<p>“The queen has friends,” replied
Cromwell, whilst on his thin, colorless
lips hovered a false and
treacherous smile, worthy of the
wicked instinct that prompted and
directed all his suspicions, and
made him foresee the surest plan
of injuring those whom he envied
or destroying those whose reputation
he intended to attack.</p>

<p>“And who are they?” demanded
the king, his ill-humor increasing
with the reflection. “Why do you
not name them, sir?”</p>

<p>“Well, for instance, Sir Thomas
More, whom your Majesty loads
with favors and distinctions, the
Bishop of Rochester, the Duke of
Norfolk, and the.…”</p>

<p>“You will soon accuse my entire
court, and each one of my servants
in particular,” cried the king; “and
in order still more to exasperate
and astound me, you have taken
particular pains to select and name
those whom I most esteem, and
who have always given me the sincerest
proofs of their devoted affection.
Go!” he suddenly cried in a
furious tone; and he fell into one
of those wild transports of rage
that frequently attacked him when
his will clashed against obstacles
which he foresaw he could neither
surmount nor destroy. He often
passed entire days absorbed in these
moods of violence, shut up in his own
apartments, suffering none to speak
to or approach him nor on any account
to attempt to divert him.</p>

<p>Abashed and alarmed, Cromwell
hastily withdrew, stammering the
most humble apologies, none of
which, however, reached the ear of
Henry VIII., who, on returning to
his chamber, raving in a demoniacal
manner, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Vile slaves! you shall be taught
to know and to respect my power.
I will make you sorely repent the
hour you have dared to oppose
me!”</p>

<p>Just as he had uttered this threatening
exclamation, Cardinal Wolsey
appeared. He could not have
chosen a more inauspicious moment.
The instant he beheld him,
the king, glaring on him with flashing
eyes, cried out:</p>

<p>“Traitor! what has brought you
here? Do you know the ambassadors
of Charles and Ferdinand, fortified
by the queen’s appeal and
protest, have overthrown all I had
accomplished at Rome with so
much precaution and difficulty?
Why have you not foreseen these
contingencies, and known that the
Pope would prove inflexible? Why
have you not advised me against
undertaking an almost impossible
thing, which will sully the honor
of my name and obscure for all
time the glory of my reign.”</p>

<p>“Stop, sire,” replied Wolsey; “I
do not deserve these cruel reproaches.
You can readily recall
how earnestly I endeavored to dissuade
you from your purpose, but
all my efforts were vain.”</p>

<p>“It is false!” cried the king, giving
vent to his rage in the most
shocking and violent expressions
he could command, to inflict upon
his minister. “And now,” he continued,
“remember well, if you fail
to extort from your legate such a
decision as I require, you shall
speedily be taught what it is to deride
my commands.”</p>

<p class="break">The sun had scarcely risen above
the horizon when already Cardinal
Campeggio (whose age and infirmities
had not changed the long
habits of an austere and laborious
life) was silently kneeling in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
midst of the choir of the palace
chapel.</p>

<p>The velvet cushions of his <i lang="fr">prie-dieu</i>
protected him from the cold
marble of the sacred pavement,
while the rays of the rising sun,
descending in luminous jets through
the arches of the antique windows,
fell on the head of the venerable
old man, giving him the appearance
of being surrounded by a halo of
celestial light. His eyes were cast
down, and he seemed to be entirely
absorbed in pious and profound
meditation.</p>

<p>Other thoughts, however, intruded
on his agitated mind, and filled
him with anxious apprehension.
“The hour rapidly approaches,”
he mentally exclaimed&mdash;“the hour
when it will be essential to come
to a decision. I have still hoped
to receive a reply&mdash;it has not yet
arrived. I alone am made responsible,
and doubtless the wrath of
the king will burst upon my head.
His vengeance will be terrible.
More than once already he has
taken occasion to manifest it.
What cruel incertitude! What
dreadful suspense! Yet what shall
be done? Speak! O my conscience!”
he exclaimed, “let me
listen, and be guided by thy voice
alone!”</p>

<p>“Despise the power of the king
who demands of thee an injustice,”
immediately replied that faithful
monitor whose stern and inflexible
voice will be summoned to testify
against us at the last judgment.
“Sayest thou, thou art afraid?
Then thou hast forgotten that the
last even of those gray hairs still
remaining to thee cannot fall without
the permission of him who created
the universe. Know that the
anger of man is but as a vain report&mdash;a
sound that vanishes in
space; and that God permits thee
not to hesitate for one instant, O
judge! when the cause of the feeble
and the innocent claims all the
strength of thy protection.”</p>

<p>Irrevocably decided, Campeggio
continued his prayer, and waited
without further apprehension the
decisive moment, so rapidly approaching.</p>

<p>In the meantime, another cardinal,
Wolsey, in great anguish of
mind, contemplated with terror the
approaching day when he would
be compelled to decide the fate of
the queen. Weary after passing a
sleepless night, spent in reflecting
on the punishment threatening him
if the will of the king was not accomplished,
he had scarcely closed
his eyes when a troop of valets
entered the chamber to assist at his
toilet. They brought his richest
vestments, with all the insignia of
his elevated rank. Wolsey regarded
them with a feeling of terror.
And when they presented him
the ivory rod which the high-chancellor
is alone empowered to carry,
he seized it with convulsive eagerness,
grasping it in his hand, as
though he feared they would tear
it from him; and with that fear
the reflection overshadowed his
soul that yesterday he had made a
last effort to ascertain and influence
the decision of the legate, without
being able to succeed!</p>

<p>Followed by his pages and gentlemen,
and still harassed by these
misgivings, he arrived at Blackfriars,
where the court awaited him. The
assembly of cardinals arose deferentially
as he entered, though all
remarked with astonishment the
pallor of his countenance and his
extreme embarrassment of manner,
so invariably composed and assured.
A portion of this visible restraint
was communicated to the
assembly, on learning that the king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
himself had arrived, and was resolved
to sit in the adjoining apartment,
where he could see and hear the
entire proceedings.</p>

<p>Dr. Bell, his advocate, after a
long preamble, began a discourse,
and during its delivery hurried exclamations
and hasty comments
were constantly indulged in by the
excited assembly, so different in
their hopes, desires, and opinions.</p>

<p>“O Rochester,” cried More, invested
with the grand official robes
of the king’s exchequer, “do you
think this man will succeed with
his arguments in carrying the
crown by storm?”</p>

<p>“No, no,” replied Rochester,
“and especially as he wishes to place
it upon such a head.”</p>

<p>“But listen, listen!” exclaimed
More, “he declares the brief of dispensation
to have been a fraud.”</p>

<p>“Ah! what notorious bad faith!”
murmured the bishop.</p>

<p>“What answer can they make to
that?” said Viscount Rochford,
in another part of the hall, addressing
the lords belonging to Anne
Boleyn’s party. “It is certainly
encouraging; we cannot doubt of
our success now.”</p>

<p>But at length the arguments,
principally dictated by Henry himself,
were closed; his advocate demanding,
in the most haughty and
authoritative manner, that a decision
should at once be rendered,
and that it should be as favorable
as it was prompt. The king during
this time, in a state of great
excitement, paced to and fro before
the entrance of the hall, the
door being left open by every one
in passing, as if he were afraid to
close it behind him. He surveyed
from time to time, with a glance of
stern, penetrating scrutiny, the assembly
before him, each member
of which tried to conceal his true
sentiments&mdash;some because they
were secretly attached to the queen,
others through fear that the cause
of Anne Boleyn might ultimately
triumph. When the advocate had
finished his discourse, each one sat
in breathless suspense anxiously
waiting the queen’s reply; but not
recognizing the authority or legality
of the tribunal, she had refused
to accept counsel, and no one consequently
appeared to defend her.
Profound silence reigned throughout
the assembly, and all eyes were
turned toward Campeggio, who
arose and stood ready to speak.
The venerable old man, calm and
dignified, in a mild but firm and
decided tone began:</p>

<p>“You ask, or rather you demand,”
he said, “that we pronounce
a decision which it would be impossible
for us in justice to render.”
Here, on seeing the king turn abruptly
around and confront him, he
paused, looking steadily at him.
“Knowing that the defendant hath
challenged this court, and refused
to recognize in our persons loyal
and disinterested judges, I have
considered it my duty, in order to
avoid error, to submit every part
of the proceedings of this council
to the tribunal of the Sovereign Pontiff;
and we shall be compelled to
await his decision before rendering
judgment or proceeding further. For
myself individually, I will furthermore
affirm, that I am here to render
justice&mdash;strict, entire, and impartial
justice, and no earthly power
can induce me to deviate from the
course I have adopted or the resolutions
I have taken; and I boldly
declare that I am too old, too feeble,
and too ill to desire the favor
or fear the resentment of any living
being.” Here he sat down,
visibly agitated.</p>

<p>Had a thunderbolt fallen in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
midst of the assembly, the tumult
and astonishment could not have
been greater. Anger, joy, fear, hope&mdash;all
hearts were agitated by the
most contradictory emotions; while
nothing was heard but the deep
murmur of voices, the noise of
unintelligible words, as they crossed
and clashed in an endless diversity
of tones. The Duke of Suffolk,
brother-in-law of the king, cried out,
beating his fists violently on the
table before him, with the gross
impetuosity of an upstart soldier,
that the old adage had again been
verified; “Never did a cardinal do
any good in England.” And with
flashing eyes and furious gestures
he pointed to Cardinal Wolsey.
The cardinal at once comprehended
his danger, but found it impossible
not to resent the insult. He
arose, pale with anger, and with
forced calmness replied that the
duke, of all living men, had the
least cause to depreciate cardinals.
For, notwithstanding he had himself
been a very insignificant cardinal,
yet, if he had not held the
office, the Duke of Suffolk would
not this day actually carry his
head on big shoulders. “And you
would not now,” he added, “be
here to exhibit the ostentatious
disdain you have manifested toward
those who have never given
you cause of offence. If you were,
my lord, an ambassador of the king
to some foreign power, you would
surely not venture to decide important
questions without first consulting
your sovereign. We also
are commissioners, and we have
no power to pronounce judgment,
without first consulting those from
whom we derive our authority; we
can do neither more nor less than
our commissions permit. Calm
yourself, then, my lord, and no more
address, in this insulting manner,
your best friend. You very well
know all I have done for you, and
you must also acknowledge that
on no occasion have I ever referred
to your obligations before.”</p>

<p>But the Duke of Suffolk heard
nothing of the last words uttered
by Wolsey. Exasperated beyond
measure, he abruptly turned his
back on the cardinal and went to
join the king in the next apartment.
He found the latter in the act
of retiring, being no longer able to
restrain his wrath within bounds;
and as his courtiers entered and
stood regarding him with a look
of hesitation he went out, commanding
them in a fierce tone and
with an imperious gesture to follow
him immediately.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the council chamber
the utmost confusion prevailed.
“God be praised!” cried Sir
Thomas More, who in the simplicity
of his heart and the excess
of his joy was incapable of dissimulation
or concealment. “God be
praised! Our queen is still queen;
and may she ever triumph thus
over all her enemies!”</p>

<p>Ensconced in the deep embrasure
of a window stood Cromwell, a silent
observer of the scene; not
permitting a word to escape him,
but gathering up every sentence
with keen avidity, and cherishing it
in his envious and malicious memory.
He found himself, nevertheless,
in a precarious and embarrassing
situation. Foreseeing the
downfall and disgrace of Wolsey, he
had sought to make friends by betraying
his benefactor. But the
king treated him with indignant
scorn, Viscount Rochford with supreme
contempt, and he strongly
suspected he had prejudiced his
sister, Anne Boleyn, also against
him.</p>

<p>Anxious and alarmed, he at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
determined to begin weaving a new
web of intrigue, and instantly cast
about him to discover what hope
remained, or what results the future
might possibly bring forth from the
discord and difficulties reigning in
the present.</p>

<p>When selfish, corrupt creatures
like Cromwell find themselves surrounded
by great and important
events, they at once assume to become
identified with the dearest
interests of the community in which
they live, without however in reality
being in the slightest degree affected,
unless through their own interests&mdash;seeking
always themselves,
and themselves alone. Thus this
heartless man, this shameful leprosy
of the social body that had nurtured
him, regarding the whole world entirely
with reference to his own selfish
designs, coolly speculated upon
his premeditated crimes, revolving in
his mind a thousand projects of aggrandizement,
which he ultimately
succeeded in bringing to a culpable
but thoroughly successful termination.</p>

<p class="break">The night had already come, yet
all were in a state of commotion in
the household of the French ambassador,
in consequence of William
du Bellay, his brother, having at a
late hour received a few hasty lines
from the bishop, written in the midst
of the assembly at Blackfriars, commanding
him to hold himself in
readiness to depart.</p>

<p>The young envoy, at once obeying
orders, assumed his travelling
costume, and had scarcely more
than attended to the last instructions
of his brother when the latter
made his appearance.</p>

<p>“Well, brother,” he exclaimed on
entering the chamber, “all is over.
Are you ready to set out?” he continued,
hurriedly surveying his
brother’s travelling attire. “The
king is furiously enraged&mdash;first
against the legate, then against
Wolsey. But Campeggio has displayed
an extraordinary degree of
firmness and courage. After he
had refused to pronounce the decision,
and just as the king was retiring,
the expected courier arrived
with instructions from Rome. The
queen’s protestation has been received,
and the Pope, dissolving the
council, revokes the commissioners’
authority, and requires the case to
be brought before his own tribunal.
The adherents of Catherine, as you
may suppose, are wild with delight&mdash;the
people throng the streets,
shouting ‘Long live the queen!’
Our gracious king, Francis I., will
be in despair.”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied William, “I am
satisfied, for I am in favor of the
queen. And now, between ourselves,
my dear brother, laying all diplomacy
aside&mdash;for we are alone, and
these walls have no ears&mdash;I know as
well as you that it matters not to
our king whether the wife of Henry
VIII. be named Anne or Catherine.</p>

<p>“And yet, after all, it may be
the name of this new Helen will
become the signal for war,” replied
the bishop. “You forget
that in marrying Anne Boleyn
Henry will be compelled to seek an
alliance with France, in order to
resist the opposition of the Emperor
Charles V.; and as for ourselves,
we have use for the five
thousand crowns he has promised
to assist us in paying the ransom
of the children of France. This
family quarrel can be arranged so
entirely to our advantage that it
would really be a misfortune should
it come to a sudden termination.
I hope, however, such may not be
the result.”</p>

<p>“You are right, brother,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Du Bellay, laughing. “I see I have
too much heart to make a skilful
diplomatist. I have already let
myself become ensnared, you perceive,
and drawn over to the cause
of this Queen Catherine. But it is
nevertheless a veritable fact, while
families are engaged in disputing
among themselves, they generally
leave their neighbors in peace. It
would seem, however, the king
must have become a madman or a
fool, thus to ignore kindred, allies,
fortune, and kingdom&mdash;all for this
Lady Anne.”</p>

<p>“Yes, much more than a madman,”
replied his brother, phlegmatically;
“after he has married
her, he will be cured of his insanity.
But come, now, let us leave Lady
Anne and her affairs. You must
know that immediately after the
adjournment of the cardinals, the
king sent for me. I found him terribly
excited, walking rapidly up
and down the great hall formerly
used as a chapter-room by the
monks. Wolsey alone was with
him, standing near the abbot’s great
arm-chair, and wearing an air of
consternation. The instant he saw
me approaching, he cried out,
‘Come, come, my lord, the king
wishes to have your advice on the
subject we are now discussing.’
And I at once perceived my presence
was a great relief to him.</p>

<p>“The king spoke immediately,
while his eyes flashed fire. ‘M.
du Bellay,’ he exclaimed, ‘Campeggio
shall be punished!&mdash;yes, punished!
Parliament shall bring him
to trial! I will never submit to
defeat in this matter. I will show
the Pope that he has underrated
both my will and my power.’</p>

<p>“‘Sire,’ I answered, ‘after mature
reflection, it seems to me it would
be a mistaken policy in your majesty
to resort to such violent measures.
Nothing has yet been decided,
and the case is by no means
hopeless; the wisest course would
therefore be to restrain all manifestation
of displeasure toward Campeggio.
What advantage could you
possibly gain by insulting or ill-treating
an old man whom you have
invited into your kingdom, or how
could you then expect to obtain a
favorable decision from the Holy
See?’</p>

<p>“Delighted to hear me express
such opinions, Wolsey eagerly
caught at my words, declaring he
agreed with me entirely. He also
advised that the doctors of the
French and German universities
should be consulted, opinions favorable
to the divorce obtained
from them, and afterwards this high
authority brought to bear upon the
decision of the court of Rome.</p>

<p>“‘What do you think of that?’
demanded the king of me. ‘As
for His Eminence Monseigneur
Wolsey,’ he added, in a tone of
cruel contempt, his counsels have
already led me into so many difficulties,
or proved so worthless, I
shall not trouble him for any further
advice.’ And he abruptly
turned his back on the cardinal.</p>

<p>“A tear rolled slowly down Wolsey’s
hollow cheek, but he made
no reply. I at once assured the
king that I thought, on the contrary,
the cardinal’s advice was most excellent,
and doubted not our king,
and his honored mother, Madame
Louise, might be induced to use
their influence in order to secure
him the suffrages of the University
of Paris. Whereupon he appeared
very much pleased with me, and
bowed me out in the most gracious
manner imaginable.</p>

<p>“Report all these things faithfully
to your master; tell him I
fear the downfall of Wolsey is inevitable;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
he is equally disliked by the
queen’s adherents and those of
Anne Boleyn, and I have every reason
for believing he will never
again be reinstated in the king’s
favor. You will also say to him he
need not be astonished that I so
often send him despatches by express,
as Cardinal Wolsey informs
me confidentially that the Duke of
Suffolk has his emissaries bribed to
open all packages of letters sent by
post, and that one addressed to me
has been miscarried; which circumstance
troubles me very much.”</p>

<p>“I will also inform my master,”
replied William, “that the Picardy
routes are so badly managed,
the gentlemen and couriers he
sends are constantly detained and
kept a considerable time on the
journey. I have complained recently
to the authorities themselves,
who assure me that their salaries
are not paid, and consequently they
are unable to keep the routes in
better condition.”</p>

<p class="break">The sun descended toward the
horizon. Sir Thomas More, seated
on a terrace of his mansion at Chelsea,
sought temporary quiet and repose
from the oppressive burdens
of a life every hour of which was
devoted to the service of his king
and country. His young children
formed a joyous group around him,
their flaxen heads crowned with
blades of wheat and wild flowers
they had gathered in the fields, for
it was the golden time of harvest.
Margaret, assisted by William Roper,
directed their games, and was now
trying to teach them a Scotch
dance, marking the wild, fantastical
rhythm with the notes of her
sweet, melodious voice. Sir Thomas
himself had joined in their
play, when suddenly the king made
his appearance. He had many
times already honored them with
such visits since Sir Thomas became
a member of the council, having
apparently conceived a great
affection for him, and every day
seeming to become more and more
pleased with his conversation.</p>

<p>“I know not why it is,” he would
often say, “but when I have been
for any length of time in conversation
with More I experience a singular
tranquillity of soul, and indeed
feel almost happy. His presence
has the magical effect of lulling
my cares to sleep and calming
my anxieties.”</p>

<p>On seeing the king, More immediately
advanced with great deference
to receive him, while the children
at once left off their sports.</p>

<p>“Why, what is this?” he exclaimed;
“I did not come to interrupt
your amusements, but on the
contrary to enjoy them with you.”
But the wild mirth and <em>abandon</em> of
the children had fled at the approach
of royalty, and, in spite of
these kind assurances, they withdrew
in rapid succession, too glad to recover
their liberty, and their father
was thus left alone with the king.</p>

<p>“Who is the young man I see
here?” inquired the sovereign.</p>

<p>“He is the affianced husband of
my daughter, sire; his name is
William Roper,” answered More.</p>

<p>“What! is she affianced already?”
said the king.</p>

<p>“Yes, sire; the family of Roper
has for many years been united to
ours by the sincerest ties of friendship,
and, strengthening these by
ties of blood, we hope greatly to
increase our mutual happiness.”</p>

<p>“That is so,” replied the king.
“And they will doubtless be happy.
In your families you preserve liberty
of choice, while we princes, born to
thrones, sacrifice our interior happiness
to those political combinations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
demanded by the interests of
our subjects.”</p>

<p>“But,” replied Sir Thomas&mdash;who
understood at once the king’s intention
was to introduce the subject
of his divorce, a topic he especially
wished to avoid&mdash;“I believe that
happiness depends on ourselves, on
our dispositions, and the manner in
which we conduct our affairs, a great
deal more than on circumstances,
or the social position in which we
chance to be born. There are
some who, possessing every advantage
in life, are still unable to enjoy
it. We would suppose them to be
perfectly happy, and they really
should be so; but true happiness
consists alone in tranquillity of soul,
which is attained by always doing
good to others, and suffering with
patient submission the trials and
afflictions with which life is inevitably
beset. Such, it seems to me, is
the circumscribed circle in which
man is confined; it is well with
him so long as he accommodates
himself to its legitimate limits, but
all is lost the moment he endeavors
to venture beyond it.”</p>

<p>“I am every day more entirely
convinced that this figure of the
circle is a painful reality,” replied
the king, with ill-concealed impatience.
“I have always hoped to
find happiness in the pursuit of
pleasure&mdash;in the gratification of
every desire&mdash;and believed it might
thus be attained, but never yet have
I been able to grasp it.”</p>

<p>“Which means, your majesty expected
to pass through the world
without trials&mdash;a thing utterly impossible,”
added More, smiling.</p>

<p>“It is that which makes me despair,
my dear Thomas. Reflecting
on the bitter disappointments I
have experienced, I am often almost
transported with rage. No,
More, you can never understand
me. You are always equally calm
and joyous. Your desires are so happily
directed that you can feel well
assured of a peaceful, quiet future
awaiting you.”</p>

<p>“Your majesty is entirely mistaken,”
replied More, “if you believe
I have never entertained other
desires than those I have been able
to accomplish. The only secret I
possess, in that respect, is, I compel
my inclinations to obey <em>me</em>, instead
of making my will subservient to
them. Nevertheless, they oftentimes
rebel and contend bitterly
for supremacy, but then, it is only
necessary to command silence, and
not be disturbed by their cries and
lamentations. Ultimately, they become
like refractory children, who,
constantly punished and severely
beaten, at last are made to tremble
at the very thought of the chastisement,
and no longer dare to revolt.”</p>

<p>“This explanation of your system
of self-government is very ingenious,”
replied the king; “and hearing
you speak in this quiet manner one
would be induced to believe it were
the easiest thing imaginable to accomplish,
rather than the most difficult.
Ah!” he continued with a
deep sigh, “I understand but too
well <em>how</em> difficult.”</p>

<p>“It is true,” replied More with
earnest simplicity, “and I would
not deny that, far from being agreeable,
it is often, on the contrary,
exceedingly painful and difficult
for a man to impose these violent
restraints upon his inclinations.
But if he who hesitates on all occasions
in the practice of virtue to
do this necessary violence to himself
and remain faithful to the requirements
of duty, would reflect
but for a single instant, he will find
that although at first he may escape
suffering and privation by voluntarily
abandoning himself to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
passions, yet, later, he will inevitably
be made to endure a far more
bitter humiliation in the torturing
reproaches of conscience; the shame
he will suffer in the loss of self-respect
and the respect of others;
and, in the inevitable course of
events, he will at last discover
that his passions have carried him
far beyond the power of self-control
or reformation!”</p>

<p>“Let us banish these reflections,
my dear More,” exclaimed the king
in a petulant tone, passing his hand
across his forehead; “they distress
me, and I prefer a change of subject.”
Saying this he arose, and,
putting his arm around Sir Thomas’
neck, they walked on together toward
the extremity of the garden,
which terminated in an extensive
and beautiful terrace, at the foot of
which flowed the waters of the
Thames.</p>

<p>The view was an extended one,
and the king amused himself watching
the rapid movements of the little
boats, filled with fishermen, rowing
in every direction, drawing in the
nets, which had been spread to dry
on the reeds covering the banks of
the river. Quantities of water-lilies,
blue flowers, floating on their large
brilliant green leaves, intermingled
with the dark bending heads of the
reeds, presenting to the distant observer
the appearance of a beautiful
variegated carpet of flowers. “What
a charming scene!” said the king,
gazing at the prospect, and pointing
to a boat just approaching the opposite
side of the river to land a troop
of young villagers, who with their
bright steel sickles in hand were returning
from the harvest fields.</p>

<p>“And the graceful spire of your
Chelsea belfry, gleaming in the distance
through the light silvery
clouds, completes this charming
landscape,” he added.</p>

<p>“Would it were possible to
transport this view to the end of
one of my drives in St. James’
Park,” continued the king.</p>

<p>“Will it be very soon completed?”
asked Sir Thomas, at a loss
what to say to his royal visitor.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” replied Henry languidly,
“but these architects are so
very slow. Before going to Grafton,
I gave them numerous orders
on the subject.”</p>

<p>“Your majesty has been quite
pleased with your journey, I believe,”
replied Sir Thomas, instantly
reflecting what he should say
next.</p>

<p>“I should have been extremely
well pleased,” he answered, with a
sudden impatience of manner, “had
Wolsey not persisted so obstinately
in following me. I have been much
too indulgent,” he continued sharply,
“infinitely too indulgent towards
him, and am now well convinced
of the mistake I have made in retaining
the slightest affection for a
man who has so miserably deceived
me. What would you think, More,”
he continued, his manner suddenly
changing, “if I appointed you in
his place as lord chancellor?”
And, turning towards Sir Thomas,
he gazed fixedly in his eyes, as if to
read the inmost emotions of his
soul.</p>

<p>“What would I think?” answered
More, calmly&mdash;then adding with a
careless smile, “I should think
your majesty had done a very
wrong thing, and made a very bad
choice.”</p>

<p>“Well, I believe I could not possibly
make a better,” said the king,
emphasizing the last words. “But I
have not come here to discuss business
matters; rather, on the contrary,
to get rid of them. Come, then,
entertain me with something more
agreeable.” But the words designedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
(though with seeming unconcern)
uttered by the king cast a
sudden gloom over the spirit of Sir
Thomas he vainly endeavored to
dispel.</p>

<p>“Sire, your majesty is greatly mistaken
in entertaining such an idea,”
he said, stammering and confused;
for, with his sincere and truthful
nature, More under all circumstances
resolutely looked to the
end of everything in which he suspected
the least dissimulation.</p>

<p>The king whirled round on his
heel, pretending not to hear him.
“This is a beautiful rose,” he said,
stooping down, “a very beautiful
variety&mdash;come from the seed, no
doubt? Are you a gardener? I
am very fond of flowers. Oh! my
garden will be superb.”</p>

<p>“Sire,” said More, still pursuing
his subject.</p>

<p>“I must have a cutting of that
rose&mdash;do you hear me, More?” As
he ran on in this manner, to prevent
Sir Thomas from speaking, the silvery
notes of a bell were heard, filling
the air with a sweet and prolonged
vibrating sound.</p>

<p>“What bell is that?” asked the
king.</p>

<p>“The bell of our chapel, sire,”
replied More, “summoning us to
evening prayers, which we usually
prefer saying all together. But to-day,
your majesty having honored
us with a visit, there will be no obligation
to answer the call.”</p>

<p>“By all means,” replied Henry.
“Let me interfere with nothing. It
is almost night: come. We will return,
and I will join in your devotions.”</p>

<p>Sir Thomas conducted him
through the shrubbery towards the
chapel, a venerable structure in
the Anglo-Saxon style of architecture.
A thick undergrowth of
briers, brambles, and wild shrubbery
was matted and interlaced
around the foundation of the building;
running vines clambered over
the heavy arches of the antique windows,
and fell back in waving garlands
upon the climbing branches
from which they had sprung. The
walls, of rough unhewn stone, were
thickly covered with moss and ivy,
giving the little structure an appearance
of such antiquity that the
most scrupulous antiquarian would
have unhesitatingly referred its foundation
to the time of King Athelstan
or his brother Edmund. The interior
was adorned with extreme care
and taste. A bronze lamp, suspended
before the altar, illuminated a
statue of the Holy Virgin placed
above it. The children of Sir
Thomas, with the servants of his
household, were ranged in respectful
silence behind the arm-chair of
his aged father. Margaret knelt
beside him with her prayer-book,
waiting to begin the devotions.</p>

<p>The touching voice of this young
girl as she slowly repeated the sublime
words&mdash;“Our Father who art
in heaven”&mdash;those words which
men may so joyfully pronounce,
which teach us the exalted dignity
of our being, the grandeur of our
origin and destiny&mdash;those sublime
words penetrated the soul of the
king with a profound and singular
emotion.</p>

<p>“What a happy family!” he exclaimed,
mentally. “Nothing disturbs
their harmony; day after day
passes without leaving a regret behind
it. Why can I not join in
this sweet prayer&mdash;why, O my soul,
hast thou banished and forgotten
it?” He turned from the contemplation
of these youthful heads
bowed before the Mother of God,
and a wave of bitter remorse swept
once again over his hardened, hypocritical
soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>After the king had returned to
his royal palace and the evening
repast was ended, William Roper
approached Sir Thomas and said:</p>

<p>“You must consider yourself
most fortunate, my dear father,
in enjoying so intimately the favor
of his majesty&mdash;why, even Cardinal
Wolsey cannot boast of being honored
with such a degree of friendship
and familiarity.”</p>

<p>With a sad smile More, taking
the young man’s hand, replied:</p>

<p>“Know, my son, I can never be
elated by it. If this head, around
which he passed his royal arm so
affectionately this evening, could
in falling pay the price of but one
single inch of French territory, he
would, without a moment’s hesitation,
deliver it up to the executioner.”</p>

<p class="break">“What acknowledgments do I
not owe you, madam,” said Sir
Thomas Cheney to Lady Anne Boleyn,
“for the services you have
rendered me. But dare I hope for
a full pardon from the king?”</p>

<p>“Feel perfectly secure on that
point,” replied Lady Anne. “He
is convinced that Wolsey had you
banished from court because of
your disagreement with Cardinal
Campeggio, and he considers you
now one of his most faithful adherents.”</p>

<p>“And I hope, madam, to have
the happiness of proving to you
that I am none the less faithfully
your servant,” replied Sir Thomas
Cheney.</p>

<p>“You must admit now,” said
Lady Anne, addressing her father
and brother, the Earl of Wiltshire
and the Viscount Rochford, who
were both present, “that I succeed
in doing what I undertake.”</p>

<p>“You succeed in what you undertake,”
replied her father humorously,
“but you are a long time in
deciding what to do. For instance,
Cardinal Wolsey finds himself to-day
occupying a position in which
he has no right to be.”</p>

<p>“Ah! well, he will not remain in
it very long,” replied Anne Boleyn,
petulantly. “This morning the
king told me the ladies would attend
the chase to see the new falcons
the king of France has sent
him by Monsieur de Sansac. I
will talk to him, and insist on his
having nothing more to do with
this horrid cardinal, or I shall at
once quit the court. But,” she
added, pausing suddenly with an
expression of extreme embarrassment,
“how should I answer were
he to demand what his eminence
Monseigneur Wolsey had ever done
to <em>me</em>?”</p>

<p>“Here, sister, here is your answer,”
replied Viscount Rochford,
taking a large manuscript book
from his father’s portfolio. “Take
it and read for yourself; you will
find here all you would need for a
reply.”</p>

<p>“That great book!” cried Anne,
strongly opposed to this new commission,
and pouting like a spoilt
child. Taking the book, she read&mdash;skipping
a great deal, however&mdash;a
minutely detailed statement, formally
accusing Wolsey of having
engaged in a secret correspondence
with France, and with the most
adroit malice misrepresenting every
act of his administration as well
as of his private life.</p>

<p>“What! can all this be true?”
cried Anne Boleyn, closing the
book.</p>

<p>“Certainly true,” replied Rochford.
“And furthermore, you
should know, the cardinal, in order
to reward Campeggio for the
good services he has rendered <em>you</em>,
has persuaded the king to send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
him home loaded with rich presents,
to conciliate the Pope, he says,
by his filial submission and pious
dispositions, and incline him to a
favorable decision. That is the
way he manages,” continued Rochford,
shrugging his shoulders, “and
keeps you in the most humiliating
position ever occupied by a woman.”</p>

<p>Hearing her brother speak thus,
the beautiful face of Anne Boleyn
became instantly suffused with a
deep crimson.</p>

<p>“Oh! that odious man,” she
cried passionately. “I shall no
longer submit to it. It is to insult
me he makes such gracious acknowledgments
to that old cardinal.
I will complain to the king.
Oh! how annoying all this is,
though,” and she turned the book
over and over in her white hands.</p>

<p>“But see, it is time to start,” she
added, pointing to a great clock
standing in one corner of the apartment.
“Good-by; I must go!”
And Anne, attired in an elegant
riding-habit, abruptly turning to a
mirror, proceeded to adjust her
black velvet riding-cap, when, observing
a small plume in her hat
that was not arranged to her taste,
she exclaimed, violently stamping
her little foot:</p>

<p>“How many contradictions shall
I meet this day? I cannot endure
it! All those horrid affairs to
think of, to talk about and explain;
all your recommendations to follow
in the midst of a delightful
hunting party; and then, after all,
this hat which so provokes me!
No; I can never fix it.” And she
hurried away to find a woman skilled
in the arts of the toilet. But
after making her sew and rip out
again, bend the plume and straighten
it, place it forward and then
back, she did not succeed in fixing
it to suit the fancy of Anne Boleyn,
who, seeing the time flying rapidly,
ended by cutting off the plume
with the scissors, throwing it angrily
on the floor and stamping it,
putting the offending cap on her
head without a plume; then mounting
her horse she rode off, accompanied
by Sir Thomas Cheney, who
escorted her, knowing she was to
join the king on the road.</p>

<p>“How impulsive and thoughtless
your sister is,” said Earl Wiltshire
to his son, after Anne had left
them, looking gloomily at the plume,
still lying on the floor where she
had thrown it. “She wants to be
queen! Do you understand how
much is comprised in that word?
Well, she would accept a crown and
fix it on her head with the same
eager interest that she would order
a new bonnet from her milliner.
Yet I firmly believe, before accepting
it, she would have to be well
assured by her mirror that it was
becoming to her style of beauty.”</p>

<p>“I cannot comprehend her,” responded
Rochford. “Her good
sense and judgment sometimes astonish
me; then suddenly a ball,
a dress, a new fashion has sufficed
to make her forget the most important
matter that might be under
discussion. I am oftentimes
led to wonder whence comes this
singular mixture of frivolity and
good sense in women. Is it a peculiarity
of their nature or the result
of education?”</p>

<p>“It is entirely the fault of education,
my son, and not of their
weakness. From infancy they are
taught to look upon ribbons, laces,
frivolities, and fashions as the most
precious and desirable things. In
fact, they attach to these miserable
trifles the same value that young
men place on a brilliant armor or
the success of a glorious action.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>“It may be so,” replied Rochford,
“but I think they are generally
found as incompetent for business
as incapable of managing affairs
of state.”</p>

<p>“While very young, perhaps not,”
answered Wiltshire; “proud and
impulsive, they are neither capable
of nor inclined to dissimulation;
but later in life they develop a
subtle ingenuity and an extreme
degree of penetration, that enable
them to succeed most admirably.”</p>

<p>“Ah! well, if the truth might be
frankly expressed, I greatly fear
that all this will turn out badly.
Should we not succeed in espousing
my sister to the king, she will
be irretrievably compromised; and
then you will deeply regret having
broken off her marriage with Lord
Percy.”</p>

<p>“You talk like an idiot,” replied
the Earl of Wiltshire. “Your
sister shall reign, or I perish.
Why should my house not give a
queen to the throne of England?
Would it not be far better if our
kings should select wives from the
nobility of their country instead
of marrying foreign princesses&mdash;strangers
alike to the manners and
customs as well as to the interests
of the people over whom they are
destined to reign?”</p>

<p>“You would probably be right,”
replied Viscount Rochford, “if the
king were not already married;
but the clergy will always oppose
this second marriage. They do
not dare to express themselves
openly because they fear the king,
but in the end they will certainly
preserve the nation in this sentiment.
I fear that Anne will yet be very unhappy,
and I am truly sorry now
she cannot be made Countess of
Northumberland.”</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue, my son,”
cried Wiltshire, frantic with rage;
“will you repeat these things to
your sister, and renew her imaginary
regrets also? As to these
churchmen over whom you make
so great an ado,” he continued
with a menacing gesture, “I hope
soon we shall be able to relieve
them of the fortunes with which
they are encumbered, and compel
them to disgorge in our favor.
You say that women are weak and
fickle! If so, you certainly resemble
them in both respects&mdash;the least
difficulty frightens you into changing
your opinions, and you hesitate
in the midst of an undertaking that
has been planned with the greatest
ability, and which, without you, I
confidently believe I shall be able
to accomplish.”</p>

<h3>IS SHE CATHOLIC?</h3>

<p>The claim put forth by the Episcopal
Church&mdash;or, to use her full
and legal title, The Protestant
Episcopal Church of the United
Slates of America&mdash;of being the
Holy Catholic Church&mdash;Holy, Catholic,
and Apostolic&mdash;and the acceptance
of her theory by a small portion
of the Christian world, makes
her and her theory, for a little time,
worthy our attention.</p>

<p>She is accustomed to use the formula,
“I believe in the Holy Catholic
Church.” It is but natural to
infer that she considers herself to
be at least an integral part of that
church. We have examined the
question, and thus present our convictions
as to her status.</p>

<p>We note, in the first place, that
her bishops possess no power.
They are bishops but in name.
There is not one of them, no matter
how eminent he may be, who
can say to a clergyman in his diocese:
“Here is an important parish
vacant; occupy it.” He would be
met with the polite remark from
some member of the parish, “We
are very much obliged to you, bishop,
but you have nothing to say
about it. Mr. M. is the warden.”</p>

<p>Mr. M., the warden, may be, and
in many instances is, a man who
cares so little about the church
that he has never yet been baptized,
much less is he a communicant.
He and his brother vestrymen,
whether baptized or not, may, if
the bishop claims an authority by
virtue of his office, meet him at the
church door, and tell him he cannot
come in unless he will pledge
himself to do as they wish; and the
bishop may write a note of protest,
and leave it behind him for them to
tear up, as was done in Chicago
with Bishop Whitehouse. Some
local regulations have occasionally
varied the above, but in the majority
of parishes the authority is
vested as we have stated.</p>

<p>The bishop’s power of appointing
extends to none but feeble
missionary stations; and even these
put on, at their earliest convenience,
the airs of full-grown parishes.</p>

<p>We note an instance where a
bishop wrote to a lady in a remote
missionary station, and asked regarding
some funds which had
been placed in her hands by parties
interested in the growth of the
church in that place. It had been
specified that the money was to be
used for whatever purpose was
deemed most necessary. The
bishop requested that the money
be paid to the missionary toward
his salary. The lady declined on
the ground that she did not like
the missionary. Another request in
courteous language, as was befitting
a bishop. He also stated his intention
of visiting the place shortly
in his official character.</p>

<p>The lady’s reply equalled his
own in courteous phraseology; but
the money was refused and the
bishop informed that he “need not
trouble himself about making a visitation,
as there was no class to be
confirmed; besides, the church had
been closed for repairs, and would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
not be open for some months, at
least not until a new minister was
settled.”</p>

<p>To the bishop’s positive knowledge,
no repairs were needed; but
he deemed it wise to stay away, and
no further steps were taken.</p>

<p>With the clergy in his diocese
the case is not very different.</p>

<p>If a presbyter of any diocese
chooses for any reason to go from
one parish to another for the purpose
of taking up a permanent
abode, he can do so with or without
consulting his bishop. In fact,
the bishop has nothing to do with
it. Should the presbyter desire to
remove to another diocese, it is requisite
that he obtain letters dimissory
from the bishop, and the
bishop is obliged to give them. So
also is the bishop in the diocese to
which he goes obliged to receive
them, unless they contain grave
criminal charges.</p>

<p>There is, in reality, but one thing
the bishop of the Protestant Episcopal
Church can do, and that is
make an appointment once in three
years to confirm. So insignificant
is his power in any other direction
that certain persons, ill-natured or
otherwise, have fastened upon him,
whether deserved or undeserved,
the name of “confirming machine.”
Certain it is that, were the power
of confirming in any degree vested
in the “priests” of the church,
the office of bishop might easily be
dispensed with. He would appear
only as the ornamental portion of a
few occasional services. For he
cannot authoritatively visit any
parish, vacant or otherwise, except
on a confirmation tour; and should
this be too frequent in the estimation
of the vestry, the doors of the
church could be shut against him
on any plea the vestry should
choose to advance.</p>

<p>2. He cannot increase the number
of his clergy, except as parishes
choose.</p>

<p>3. He cannot prevent a man fixing
himself in the diocese if a congregation
choose to “call” him, no
matter how worthy or unworthy
the man may be.</p>

<p>4. He cannot call a clergyman
into his diocese, though every parish
were empty.</p>

<p>5. He cannot officiate in any
church without invitation.</p>

<p>6. He has no church of his
own, except as he officiates as rector;
and unless invited to some
place, he is forced, although a bishop,
to sit in the congregation as a
layman, if he do not stay at home.</p>

<p>And, lastly, he cannot on any
account visit a parish unless the
vestry of that parish is willing.</p>

<p>We sum up: That so far as the
bishops of the Protestant Episcopal
Church of the United States
of America are concerned, they are
simply figure-heads, ornaments possessing
the minimum of authority&mdash;in
point of fact, no authority at all.</p>

<p>Their own convention addresses
are a virtual confession of the condition
of affairs as above laid down.
To every one who has ever heard
an Episcopal bishop’s address, as
delivered before the annual convention
of clergymen and laymen, the
following sample will not appear
as in the least overdrawn:</p>

<p>July 10.&mdash;Visited the parish of
S. John, Oakdale, and confirmed
three.</p>

<p>July 17.&mdash;Visited the parish of
Longwood, and preached and confirmed
one.</p>

<p>July 24.&mdash;Visited S. Paul’s, and
preached and confirmed two in the
forenoon. Preached also in the afternoon.</p>

<p>This is a very large and thriving
parish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>July 26.&mdash;At Montrose I visited
and confirmed one at the evening
service.</p>

<p>July 29.&mdash;Took a private conveyance
to Hillstown, and preached in
the evening; confirmed one. The
rector of this parish is very energetic.</p>

<p>Aug. 2.&mdash;Attended the burial of
a dear friend.</p>

<p>Aug. 7.&mdash;Attended the consecration
of S. Mark’s Church in Hyde
Park. It is hoped that the difficulties
in this parish are settled. The
Rev. John Waters has resigned
and gone to Omaha. Mr. William
Steuben is the senior warden.
May the Lord prosper him and
his estimable lady!</p>

<p>[To continue the list would cause
a tear, and we do not wish to weep.]</p>

<p>The address each year of a Protestant
Episcopal bishop is thoroughly
exemplified in the foregoing
specimen. It is the same endless
list of <i lang="el">enteuthen exelauneis</i>, varied
only by the number of <i lang="el">parasangas</i>.
To the lazy grammar-boy it is a
most fascinating chapter of ancient
history when he reaches the <i lang="el">enteuthen</i>
section in the <cite>Anabasis</cite>.
There is an immense list of them,
and the lesson for that day is easy.
When the first phrase is mastered,
he knows all the rest, except the
occasional figures.</p>

<p>We once saw a reporter for a
prominent Daily making a short-hand
report of an address before
an illustrious diocesan gathering.
Having had some experience in the
matter, he came to the meeting with
his tablets prepared. They were
as follows:</p>

<table summary="The tablet was laid out like this">
  <tr>
    <td><span class="smcap">Visited at</span></td>
    <td><span class="smcapuc">AND CONFIRMED.</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>_______________</td>
    <td>_____  _________</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>_______________</td>
    <td>_____  _________</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>_______________</td>
    <td>_____  _________</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Three-quarters of the address
was thus prepared beforehand, it
only being necessary to leave the
lines sufficiently far apart to permit
the insertion of occasional notes.</p>

<p>By his extra care he was enabled
to present the most complete report
of any paper in the city.</p>

<p>The specimen we have given is a
fair average. In future generations,
when a classical student is given a
bishop’s address to read, his labor
for that day will be easy.</p>

<p>Almost any bishop’s address will
substantiate the statements we have
made. We refer to them freely,
without wasting time in selection.</p>

<p>We begin a new paragraph: The
system of the Protestant Episcopal
Church is eminently congregational.</p>

<p>If a parish chooses to “call” a
given man, he is “called.”</p>

<p>Should the bishop “interfere”
and recommend him, the recommendation,
without an exception
that has ever come to our knowledge,
militates against the proposed
“call.”</p>

<p>Should a parish desire to get rid
of a pastor, it does so with or without
the consent of the bishop, as
happens, in the estimation of the
wardens, to be most convenient.
The officers may consult the bishop,
and, if he agree with them, well and
good. The words of the diocesan
are quoted from Dan to Beersheba,
and the pastor is made to feel the
lack of sympathy&mdash;“Even his bishop
is against him,” is whispered
by young and old.</p>

<p>If the bishop does not agree with
them, they do not consult him
again. They proceed to accomplish
what they desire as if he had
no existence, and&mdash;they always succeed.</p>

<p>There is a farcical canon of the
Protestant Episcopal Church which
says, if a parish dismiss its rector<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
without concurrence, it shall not
be admitted into convention until
it has apologized.</p>

<p>It is a very easy thing for the
wardens and vestrymen to address
the convention, after they have accomplished
their ends, with “Your
honorable body thinks we have
done wrong, and&mdash;we are sorry for
it,” or something else equally ambiguous
and absurd. The officers
of the parish and the laymen of the
congregation have done what they
wished, and are content. As the
convention is composed principally
of laymen, the sympathy is naturally
with the laymen’s side of the
question. The rector is hurriedly
passed over, his clerical brethren
looking helplessly on.</p>

<p>To get a new parish the dismissed
rector must “candidate”&mdash;a
feature of clerical life most revolting
to any man with a spark of manhood
in him.</p>

<p>We note, in the next place, an utter
want of unity in the Protestant
Episcopal Church.</p>

<p>There are High-Church and Low-Church
bookstores, where the publications
of the one are discarded
by the other. There are High-Church
and Low-Church seminaries,
where a man, to graduate from
the one, will be looked upon inimically,
at least with suspicion, by
the other. There is a High-Church
“Society for the Increase of the
Ministry,” where the principal thing
accomplished is the maintenance
of the secretary of the said society
in a large brick house in a
fashionable city, while he claims to
support a few students on two
meals a day; and a Low-Church
Evangelical Society, where they require
the beneficiary to subscribe
to certain articles of Low-Churchism
before they will receive him.</p>

<p>The one society is thoroughly
hostile to the other, and, in point of
fact, the latter was created in opposition
to the former.</p>

<p>There is but one thing in common
between the two, and that is
cold-shoulderism.</p>

<p>There are High-Church and Low-Church
newspapers, in which the
epithets used by the one toward
the other do not indicate even <em>respect</em>.</p>

<p>Some of the “church’s” ministers
would no more enter a “denominational”
place of worship
than they would put their hand in
the fire. Others will fraternize
with everything and everybody,
and when Sunday comes will close
their eyes&mdash;sometimes they roll
them upward&mdash;and pray publicly:
“From heresy and schism good
Lord deliver us.”</p>

<p>It may be necessary that there
should be wranglings and bickerings
within her fold, in order to constitute
her the church militant; but
we cannot forgive hypocrisy.</p>

<p>With some of her ministers the
grand object of existence seems to
be to prove “Popery” an emanation
from hell. With others the
effort is equally great to prove the
Episcopal Church as a “co-ordinate”
branch with the Roman
Church, and entitled to the same
consideration as is paid by the
devotees of Rome to its hierarchy.
In both instances&mdash;viz., High
Church and Low Church&mdash;history
records failure.</p>

<p>We notice next the relation which
the Protestant Episcopal Church
holds to the Church of England.</p>

<p>The English Church evidently
regards the Protestant Episcopal
Church of the United States of
America as a weaker sister, and not
to be admitted to doubtful disputations.
She is courteous toward her,
and accepts her present of a gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
alms-basin from an unrobed representative
with a certain amount of
ceremony. She invites her bishops
to the Lambeth Conference, and
they pay their own fare across the
Atlantic; but they confer about
nothing. It is true the Protestant
Episcopal Church approved the action
of the English Church in condemning
Colenso; but this was a
safe thing for the English Church
to present. It would have been
hardly complimentary to have their
guests go home without doing
something, especially as they were
not to be invited into Westminster
Abbey, and were to have nothing to
do with the coming Bible revision.</p>

<p>The bishops of the Protestant
Episcopal Church of the United
States of America were invited to
the English conference very much
as country cousins are invited to
tea, and that was all.</p>

<p>By way of asserting her right to
a recognition as an equal with the
Church of England, she&mdash;the Protestant
Episcopal Church of the
United States of America&mdash;has
established, or rather individuals
have established and the act has received
the sanction of the General
Convention, certain rival congregations
in a few foreign cities
where the English service was already
established. If she be of
the same Catholic mould as the
Church of England, why does she
thus in a foreign city attempt to
maintain an opposition service?
The variations in the Prayer-Book
are no answer to the question. If
the English Church be Holy, Catholic,
and Apostolic, and the Protestant
Episcopal Church be Holy,
Catholic, and Apostolic, the two
are therefore one; for they both
claim that there is but one Holy,
Catholic, and Apostolic church.</p>

<p>She is in this case unmistakably
uncatholic, or else the English
Church is. In either case she falls
to the ground.</p>

<p>Our attention is directed again
to the many laws enacted against
her bishops as compared with the
laws enacted against the other members
of the church. If Mosheim
were to be restored to the flesh,
and were to write the history of
the Episcopal Church, and used as
an authority the Digest of Canons,
as he has been accustomed in his
<cite>Ecclesiastical History</cite> to use ecclesiastical
documents generally, he
would style the bishops of the
Protestant Episcopal Church a set
of criminals of the deepest dye,
and the priests and deacons not
much better. The laity would be
regarded as all that could be desired
in lofty integrity and spotless morality.
For why? A glance at their
vade-mecum of law&mdash;the Digest of
Canons&mdash;shows an immense bulk
of its space to be devoted “to the
trial of a bishop.” The laity go
scot-free.</p>

<p>We question the propriety, as well
as the Catholicity, of covering the
higher clergy with laws till they are
helpless, while the laity revel in a
freedom that amounts, when they
choose, to mob-license; but it is
done, and the Episcopal Church is
degraded to a level lower than any
of the denominations around her.</p>

<p>With other bodies who call themselves
Christian there is a certain
amount of consistency. Their rulers
are from among their own
members. With the church under
consideration, her rulers, in many
cases, are any unbaptized heathen
who may choose to work themselves
into a temporary favor with the
pew-holders. It is not necessary
that they should even have ever attended
church. We note an instance
where the chief man of a
small parish was a druggist, and
kept in the rear of his drug-store a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
low drinking-room; and this man
was elected treasurer year after
year by a handful of interested
parties, and, when elected, he managed
all the finances of the parish
according to his own notions of
propriety. It was his habit to go
to the church near the close of the
sermon, and go away immediately
after the collection.</p>

<p>We note another instance where
a warden visited the rector of his
parish, and threatened, with a polite
oath, to give him something hotter
than a section of the day of judgment
if he did not ask his (the warden’s)
advice a little more on parish matters.
The parish grew so warm
that at the end of three weeks the
rector was candidating for another.</p>

<p>We note another instance where
a warden was so overjoyed at having
settled a rector according to
his own liking that, on the arrival
of the new incumbent, he not only
did not go to hear him preach, but
stayed at home with certain friends,
and enjoyed, to use his own expression,
a “dooced big drunk.” Out of
consideration for the feelings of his
family we use the word “dooced”
instead of his stronger expression.</p>

<p>The rector of this happily-ruled
parish was imprudent enough to
incur the displeasure of his warden
after a few months of arduous labor.
He received a note while sitting
at the bedside of his sick wife,
saying that after the following Sunday
his services would be dispensed
with; that if he attempted to stay,
the church would be closed for
repairs.</p>

<p>We are well acquainted with a
parish where a congregation wished
to displace both the senior and
junior wardens. These two gentlemen
had been shrewd enough to
foresee the event. They succeeded,
by calculating management, in having
vested in themselves the right
of selling pews. When Easter
Monday came, they sold for a dollar
a pew to loafers on the streets,
and swarmed the election with men
who never had entered the place before.
The laws of the parish were
such that there was no redress.
As a matter of course, the rector
was soon candidating.</p>

<p>During the earliest portion of the
official life of one of the oldest
and most eminent bishops, he was
called on to officiate at the institution
of a Low-Church rector. At
the morning service the bishop
took occasion to congratulate the
congregation on the assumed fact
that they had now “an altar, a
priest, and a sacrifice,” and went on
to enlarge on that idea. In the
evening of the same day the instituted
minister, in addressing the
congregation, said: “My brethren,
so help me God! if the doctrines
you heard this morning are the
doctrines of the Protestant Episcopal
Church, then I am no Protestant
Episcopalian; but they are
not such”&mdash;and essayed substantiating
the assertion. All that
came of the affair was the publication,
on the part of each, of their
respective discourses. On the supposition
of the bishop’s having any
foundation for his ecclesiastical
character and for the doctrines he
taught, would that have been the
end of the matter?</p>

<p>Can it be that the Episcopal
Church is Catholic? Is it possible
that she is part of the grand structure
portrayed by prophets and
sung in the matchless words of inspiration
as that against which the
gates of hell shall not prevail?
Rather, we are forced to class her
as a “sister” among the very “heretics”
from whom in her litany she
prays, “Good Lord deliver us.”</p>

<h3>ARE YOU MY WIFE?</h3>

<p class="center">BY THE AUTHOR OF “PARIS BEFORE THE WAR,” “NUMBER THIRTEEN,” “PIUS VI.,” ETC.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="smcap">Alarming Symptoms.</span></h4>

<p>November had come, and was
gathering up the last tints and blossoms
of autumn. One by one the
garden lights were being put out;
the tall archangel lilies drooped
their snow and gold cups languidly;
the jasmine, that only the other
day twinkled its silver stars amidst
the purple bells of the clematis, now
trailed wearily down the trellis of
the porch; the hardy geraniums
made a stand for it yet, but their
petals dropped off at every puff of
wind, and powdered the gravel with
a scarlet ring round their six big
red pots that flanked the walk from
the gate to the cottage door; the
red roses held out like a forlorn
hope, defying the approach of the
conqueror, and staying to say a last
good-by to sweet Mother Summer,
ere she passed away.</p>

<p>It was too chilly to sit out of
doors late of afternoons now, and
night fell quickly. M. de la Bourbonais
had collapsed into his brown
den; but the window stood open,
and let the faint incense of the garden
steal in to him, as he bent over
his desk with his shaded lamp beside
him.</p>

<p>Franceline had found it cold, and
had slipt away, without saying why,
to her own room upstairs. She was
sitting on the floor with her hands
in her lap, and her head pressed
against the latticed window, watching
the scarlet geraniums as they
shivered in the evening breeze and
dropped into their moist autumn
tomb. A large crystal moon was
rising above the woods beyond the
river, and a few stars were coming
out. She counted them, and listened
to the wood-pigeon cooing in the
park, and to the solitary note of an
owl that answered from some distant
grove. But the voices of wood and
field were not to her now what they
once had been. There was something
in her that responded to them
still, but not in the old way; she
had drifted somewhere beyond their
reach; she was hearkening for
other voices, since one had touched
her with a power these had never
possessed, and whose echoing sweetness
had converted the sounds that
had till then been her only music
into a blank and aching silence.
Other pulses had been stirred, other
chords struck within her, so strong
and deep, and unlike the old childish
ones, that these had become to
her what the memory of the joys of
childhood are to the full-grown
man&mdash;a sweet shadow that lingers
when the substance has fled; part
of a life that has been lived, that
can never be quickened again, but
is enshrined in memory.</p>

<p>She was very pale, almost like a
shadow herself, as she sat there in
the silver gloom. Mothers who
met her in her walks about the
neighborhood looked wistfully after
the gentle young face, and said with
a sigh: “What a pity! And so
young too!” Yet Franceline was
not ill; not even ailing; she never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
complained even of fatigue, and
when her father tapped the pale
cheek and asked how his <i lang="fr">Clair-de-lune</i>
was, she would answer brightly
that she had never been better in
her life, and as she had no cough,
he believed her. A cough was
Raymond’s single diagnosis of disease
and death; he had a vague
but deep-seated belief that nobody,
no young person certainly, ever died
a natural death without this fatal
premonitory symptom. And yet
he could not help following Franceline
with an anxious eye as he saw
her walking listlessly about the garden,
or sitting with a book in her
hand that she let drop every now
and then to look dreamily out of
the window, and only resumed with
an evident effort. Sometimes she
would go and lean her arms on the
rail at the end of the garden, and
stand there for an hour together
gazing at the familiar landscape as
if she were discovering some new
feature in it, or straining her eyes
to see some distant object. He
could not lay his finger on any particular
symptom that justified anxiety,
and still he was anxious; a
change of some sort had come over
the child; she grew more and more
like her mother, and it was not until
Armengarde was several years older
than Franceline that the disease
which had been germinating in her
system from childhood developed
itself and proved fatal.</p>

<p>M. de la Bourbonais never alluded
to Franceline’s refusal of Sir
Ponsonby Anwyll, but he had not
forgotten it. In his dreamy mind he
cogitated on the possibility of the
offer being renewed, and her accepting
it. As to Clide de Winton,
he had quite ceased to think of
him, and never for an instant coupled
him in his thoughts with Franceline.
It did not strike him as significant
that Sir Simon had avoided
mentioning the young man since
his return. After the conversation
that Clide had once been the subject
of between them, this reticence
was natural enough. The failure
of his wild, affectionate scheme
placed him in a somewhat ridiculous
position towards Raymond,
and it was no wonder that he
shrank from alluding to it.</p>

<p>Sir Ponsonby had left Rydal immediately
after the eventful ride we
know of. He could not remain in
Franceline’s neighborhood without
seeing her, and he had sense enough
to feel that he would injure rather
than serve his cause by forcing his
society on her after what had passed.
This is as good as admitting
that he did not look upon his cause
as lost. What man in love for the
first time would give up after one
refusal, if his love was worth the
name? Ponsonby was not one of
the faint-hearted tribe. He combined
real modesty as to his own
worth and pretensions with unbounded
faith in the power of his
love and its ultimate success. The
infallibility of hope and perseverance
was an essential part of his
lover’s creed. He did not apply
the tenet with any special sense of
its fitness to Franceline in particular.
He was no analyzer of character;
he did not discriminate nicely between
the wants and attributes of
one woman and another; he blended
them all in a theoretical worship,
and included all womankind in his
notions as to how they were individually
to be wooed and won. He
would let them have their own way,
allow them unlimited pin-money,
cover them with trinkets, and gratify
all their little whims. If a girl
were ever so beautiful and ever so
good, no man could do more for
her than this; and any man who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
was able and willing to do it, ought
to be able to win her. Ponsonby
took heart, and trusted to his uniform
good luck not to miss the
prize he had set his heart on. He
would rejoin his regiment for the
present, and see what a month’s
absence would do for him. He
had one certain ground of hope:
Franceline did not dislike him, and,
as far as he could learn or guess,
she cared for no one else. Sir Simon
was his ally, and would keep
a sharp lookout for him, and keep
the little spark alive&mdash;if spark there
were&mdash;by singing his praises judiciously
in the ear of the cruel fair
one.</p>

<p>She, meanwhile, went on in her
usual quiet routine, tending the
sick, teaching some little children,
and working with her father, who
grew daily more enamored of her
tender and intelligent co-operation.
Lady Anwyll called soon after Ponsonby’s
departure, and was just as
kind and unconstrained as if nothing
had happened. She did not
press Franceline to go and stay at
Rydal, but hoped she would ride
over there occasionally with Sir
Simon to lunch. Her duties as
secretary to Raymond made the
sacrifice of a whole afternoon repugnant
to her; but she did go
once, just to show the old lady that
she retained the same kind feeling
towards her as before anything had
occurred to make a break in their
intimacy. It was delightful when
she came home to find that her father
had been utterly at sea without
her, mooning about in a helpless
way amongst the notes and papers
that under her management had
passed from confusion and chaos
into order and sequence. While
everything was in confusion he
could find his way through the
maze, but he had no key to this
new order of things. Franceline
declared she must never leave him
so long again; he had put everything
topsy-turvy, he was not to be trusted.
The discovery of his dependence
on her in a sphere where she
had till lately been as useless to
him as Angélique or Miss Merrywig
was a source of infinite enjoyment
to her, and she threw herself into
her daily task with an energy that
lightened the labor immensely to
her father, without, as far as Franceline
could say, fatiguing herself.
But fatigue for being unconscious
is sometimes none the less real.
It may be that this sustained application
was straining a system already
severely tried by mental pressure.
She was one day writing
away as usual, while Raymond, with
a bookful of notes in his hand,
stood on the hearth-rug dictating.
Suddenly she was seized with a fit
of coughing, and, putting her handkerchief
quickly to her mouth, she
drew it away stained with crimson.
She stifled a cry of terror that rose
to her lips, and hurried out of the
room. Her father had seen nothing,
but her abrupt departure
startled him; he hastened after her,
and found her in the kitchen holding
the handkerchief up to Angélique,
who was looking at the fatal
stain with a face rather stupefied
than terrified.</p>

<p>“My God, have pity upon me!
My child! My child!” he cried,
clasping his hands and abandoning
himself to his distress with the impassioned
demonstrativeness of a
Frenchman.</p>

<p>Woman, it is said truly, is more
courageous at bearing physical pain
than man; it is true also that she
has more self-command in controlling
the expression of mental pain.
Her instinct is surer too in guiding
her how to save others from suffering;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
let her be ever so untutored,
she will prove herself shrewder
than the cleverest man on occasions
like the present. Angélique’s
womanly instinct told her at once
that it was essential not to frighten
Franceline: that the nervous shock
would infallibly aggravate the evil,
wherever the cause lay, and that
the best thing to do now was to
soothe and allay her fears.</p>

<p>“Bless me! what is there to
make a row about?” she cried with
an angry chuckle, crushing the
handkerchief in her fingers and
darting a look on her master
which, if eyes could knock down,
must have laid him prostrate on
the spot; “the child has an indigestion
and has thrown up a
mouthful of bread from her stomach.
Hein!”</p>

<p>“How do you know it is from
the stomach and not from the
lungs?” he asked, already reassured
by her confidence, and still
more by her incivility.</p>

<p>“How do I know? Am I a
fool? Would it be that color if it
was from the lungs? I say it is
from the stomach, and it is a good
business. But we must not have
too much of it. It would weaken
the child; we must stop it.”</p>

<p>“I will run for the doctor at
once!” exclaimed M. de la Bourbonais,
still trembling and excited.
“Or stay!&mdash;no!&mdash;I will fly to the
Court and they will despatch a
man on horseback!” He was hurrying
away when Angélique literally
shouted at him:</p>

<p>“Wilt thou be quiet with thy
doctor and thy man on horseback!
I tell thee it is from the stomach;
I know what I am about. I want
neither man nor horse. It is from
the stomach! Dost thou take me
for a fool at this time of my life?”</p>

<p>Raymond stood still like a chidden
child while the old servant
poured this volley at him. Franceline
stared at her aghast. In her
angry excitement the grenadier
had broken through not only all
barriers of rank, but all the common
rules of civility&mdash;she who was
such a strict observer of both that
they seemed a very part of herself.
This ought to have opened their
eyes, if nothing else did; but Franceline
was only bewildered, Raymond
was cowed and perplexed.</p>

<p>“If thou art indeed quite sure,”
he said, falling into the familiar
“thee and thou” by which she addressed
him, and which on her deferential
lips sounded so outrageous
and unnatural&mdash;“if thou art indeed
certain I will be satisfied; but, my
good Angélique, would it not be a
wise precaution to have a medical
man?&mdash;only just, as thou sayest
well, to prevent its going too far.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, if Monsieur le Comte
wishes, let it be; let the doctor
come; for me, I care not for him;
they are an ignorant lot, pulling
long faces to make long bills; but
if it pleases Monsieur le Comte, let
him have one to see the child.”
She nodded her flaps at him, as if
to say, “Be off then at once and
leave us in peace!”</p>

<p>He was leaving the room, when,
turning round suddenly, he came
close up to Franceline. “Dost
thou feel a pain, my child?” he said,
peering anxiously into her face.</p>

<p>“No, father, not the least pain.
I am sure Angélique is right; I feel
nothing here,” putting her hand to
her chest.</p>

<p>“God is good! God is good!”
muttered the father half audibly,
and, stroking her cheek gently, he
went.</p>

<p>“Let not Monsieur le Comte go
rushing off himself; let him send
one of those thirty-six lackeys at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the Court!” cried Angélique, calling
after him through the kitchen
window.</p>

<p>In her heart and soul Angélique
was terrified. She had thrown
out quite at random, with the instinct
of desperation, that confident
assurance as to the color of the
stain. Her first impulse was to
save Franceline from the shock,
but it had fallen full upon herself.
This accident sounded like the first
stroke of the death-knell. No one
would have supposed it to look at
her. She set her arms akimbo and
laughed till she shook at her own
impudence to M. le Comte, and
how meekly M. le Comte had borne
it, and how scared his face was, and
what a joke the business was altogether.
To see him stand there
wringing his hands, and making
such a wailing about nothing!
But when Franceline was going to
answer and reproach her old <i lang="fr">bonne</i>
with this inopportune mirth, she
laid her hand on the young girl’s
mouth and bade her peremptorily
be silent.</p>

<p>“If you go talking and scolding,
child, there is no knowing what
mischief you may do. Come and
lie down, and keep perfectly quiet.”</p>

<p>Franceline obeyed willingly
enough. She was weak and tired,
and glad to be alone awhile.</p>

<p>Angélique placed a cold, wet
cloth on her chest, and made her
some cold lemonade to drink. It
was making a fuss about nothing,
to be sure; but it would please M.
le Comte. He was never happier
than when people were making a
fuss over his <i lang="fr">Clair-de-lune</i>.</p>

<p>It was not long before the count
returned, accompanied by Sir Simon.
Angélique saw at a glance
that the baronet understood how
things were. He talked very big
about his confidence that Angélique
was right; that it was an accident
of no serious import whatever;
but he exchanged a furtive glance
with the old woman that sufficiently
belied all this confident talk. He
was for going up to see Franceline
with M. de la Bourbonais, but Angélique
would not allow this. M. le
Comte might go, if he liked, provided
he did not make her speak;
but nobody else must go; the room
was too small, and it would excite
the child to see people about her.
So Raymond went up alone. As
soon as his back was turned, Angélique
threw up her hands with
a gesture too significant for any
words. Sir Simon closed the door
gently.</p>

<p>“I am not duped any more than
you,” he said. “It is sure to be
very serious, even if it is not fatal.
Tell me what you really think.”</p>

<p>“I saw her mother go through
it all. It began like this. Only
Madame la Comtesse had a cough;
the petite has never had one.
That is the only thing that gives
me a bit of hope; the petite has
never coughed. O Monsieur Simon!
it is terrible. It will kill
us all three; I know it will.”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut! don’t give up in this
way, Angélique,” said the baronet
kindly, and turning aside; “that
will mend nothing; it is the very
worst thing you could do. I agree
with you that it is very serious;
not so much the accident itself,
perhaps&mdash;we know nothing about
that yet&mdash;but on account of the
hereditary taint in the constitution.
However, there has been no cough
undermining it so far, and with
care&mdash;I promise you she shall
have the best&mdash;there is every reason
to hope the child will weather it.
At her age one weathers everything,”
he added, cheerfully.
“Come now, don’t despond; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
great deal depends on your keeping
a cheerful countenance.”</p>

<p>“I know it, monsieur, and I will
do my best. But I hear steps!
Could it be the doctor already?
For goodness’ sake run out and meet
him, and tell him, as he hopes to save
us all, not to let Monsieur le Comte
know there is any danger! It is
all up with us if he does. Monsieur
le Comte could no more hide it
than a baby could hide a pin in its
clothes.”</p>

<p>She opened the door and almost
pushed Sir Simon out, in her terror
lest the doctor should walk in
without being warned.</p>

<p>Sir Simon met him at the back
of the cottage. A few words were
exchanged, and they came in together.
Raymond met them on
the stairs. The medical man preferred
seeing his patient alone; the
nurse might be present, but he
could have no one else. In a very
few minutes he came down, and a
glance at his face set the father’s
heart almost completely at rest.</p>

<p>“Dear me, Sir Simon, you would
never do for a sick nurse. You
prepared me for a very dangerous
case by your message; it is a mere
trifle; hardly worth the hard ride
I’ve had to perform in twenty minutes.”</p>

<p>“Then there is nothing amiss
with the lungs?”</p>

<p>“Would you like to sound them
yourself, count? Pray do! It
will be more satisfactory to you.”
And he handed his stethoscope to
M. de la Bourbonais&mdash;not mockingly,
but quite gravely and
kindly.</p>

<p>That provincial doctor missed
his vocation. He ought to have
been a diplomatist.</p>

<p>Instead of the proffered stethoscope,
M. de la Bourbonais grasped
his hand. His heart was too full
for speech. The reaction of security
after the brief interval of agony
and suspense unnerved him. He sat
down without speaking, and wiped
the great drops from his forehead.
The medical man addressed himself
to Sir Simon and Angélique. There
was nothing whatever to be alarmed
at; but there was occasion for care
and certain preventive measures.
The young lady must have perfect
rest and quiet; there must be no
talking for some time; no excitement
of any sort. He gave sundry
directions about diet, etc., and
wrote a prescription which was to
be sent to the chemist at once.
M. de la Bourbonais accompanied
him to the door with a lightened
heart, and bade him <i lang="fr">au revoir</i> with
a warm pressure of the hand.</p>

<p>“Now, let me hear the truth,”
said Sir Simon, as soon as they entered
the park.</p>

<p>“You have heard the truth&mdash;though
only in a negative form. If
you noticed, we did not commit ourselves
to any opinion of the case;
we only prescribed for it. This
was the only way in which we
could honestly follow your instructions,”
observed the doctor, who
always used the royal “we” of authorship
when speaking professionally.</p>

<p>“You showed great tact and prudence;
but there is no need for
either now. Tell me exactly what
you think.”</p>

<p>“It will be more to the purpose
to tell you what we know,” rejoined
the medical man. “There is a
blood-vessel broken; not a large
one, happily, and if the hemorrhage
does not increase and continue,
it may prove of no really serious
consequence. But then we must
remember the question of inheritance.
That is what makes a
symptom in itself trifling assume a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
grave&mdash;we refrain from saying fatal&mdash;character.”</p>

<p>“You are convinced that this is
but the beginning of the end&mdash;am
I to understand that?” asked Sir
Simon. He was used to the doctor’s
pompous way, and knew him
to be both clever and conscientious,
at least towards his patients.</p>

<p>“It would be precipitating an
opinion to say so much. We are
on the whole inclined to take a
more sanguine view. We consider
the hitherto unimpaired health of
the patient, and her extreme youth,
fair grounds for hope. But great
care must be taken; all excitement
must be avoided.”</p>

<p>“You may count on your orders
being strictly carried out,” said Sir
Simon.</p>

<p>They walked on a few yards without
further speech. Sir Simon was
busy with anxious and affectionate
thoughts.</p>

<p>“I should fancy a warm climate
would be the best cure for a case of
this kind,” he observed, answering
his own reflections, rather than
speaking to his companion.</p>

<p>“No doubt, no doubt,” assented
Dr. Blink, “if the patient was in a
position to authorize her medical
attendant in ordering such a measure.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur de la Bourbonais is in
that position,” replied Sir Simon,
quietly.</p>

<p>“Ah! I am glad to know it. I
may act on the information one of
these days. The young lady could
not bear the fatigue of a journey to
the south just now; the general
health is a good deal below par;
the nervous system wants toning;
it is unstrung.”</p>

<p>Sir Simon made no comment&mdash;not
at least in words&mdash;but it set his
mind on painful conjecture. Perhaps
the electric chain passed from
him to his companion, for the latter
said irrelevantly but with a significant
expression, as he turned
his glance full upon Sir Simon:</p>

<p>“We medical men are trusted
with many secrets&mdash;secrets of the
heart as well as of the body. We
ask you frankly, as a friend of our
patient, is there any moral cause at
work&mdash;any disappointed affection
that may have preyed on the mind
and fostered the inherited germs
of disease?”</p>

<p>“I cannot answer that question,”
replied the baronet after a moment’s
hesitation.</p>

<p>“You cannot, or you will not?
Excuse my pertinacity; it is professional
and necessary.”</p>

<p>Sir Simon hesitated again before
he answered.</p>

<p>“I cannot even give a decided
answer to that. I had some time
ago feared there existed something
of the sort, but of late those apprehensions
had entirely disappeared.
If you had put the question to me
yesterday, I should have said emphatically
there is nothing to fear
on that score; the child is perfectly
happy and quite heart-whole.”</p>

<p>“And to-day you are not prepared
to say as much,” persisted
Dr. Blink. “Something has occurred
to modify this change of opinion?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, except the accident
that you know of and your question
now. These suggest to me that I
may have been right in the first instance.”</p>

<p>“Is it in your power or within
the power of circumstances to set
the wrong right&mdash;to remove the
cause of anxiety&mdash;assuming that it
actually exists?”</p>

<p>“No, it is not; nothing can remove
it.”</p>

<p>“And she is aware of this?”</p>

<p>“I fear not.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>“Say rather that you hope not.
In such cases hope is the best physician;
let nothing be done, as far
as you can prevent it, to destroy
this hope in the patient’s mind; I
would even venture to urge that
you should do anything in your
power to feed and stimulate it.”</p>

<p>“That is impossible; quite impossible,”
said Sir Simon emphatically.
The doctor’s words fell on
him like a sting, and this very feeling
increased to conviction what
had, at the beginning of the conversation,
been only a vague misgiving.</p>

<p class="break">Franceline rallied quickly, and
with her returning strength Sir Simon’s
fears were allayed. He had
not been able to follow the doctor’s
advice as to keeping alive any
soothing delusions that might exist
in her mind, but he succeeded, by
dint of continually dinning it into
his ears that there was no danger,
in convincing her father that there
was not; and the cheerfulness and
security that radiated from him
acted beneficially on her, and
proved of great help to the medical
treatment. And was Dr. Blink
right in his surmise that a moral
cause had been at work and contributed
to the bursting of the
blood-vessel? If Franceline had
been asked she would have denied
it; if any one had said to her that
the accident had been brought on
by mental suffering, or insinuated
that she was still at heart pining
for a lost love, she would have answered
with proud sincerity: “It
is false; I am not pining. I have
ceased to think of Clide de Winton;
I have ceased to love him.”</p>

<p>But which of us can answer truly
for our own hearts? We do not
want to idealize Franceline. We
wish to describe her as she was, the
good with the evil; the struggle
and the victory as they alternated
in her life; her heart fluctuating,
but never consciously disloyal.
There must be flaws in every picture
taken from life. Perfection is
not to be found in nature, except
when seen through a poet’s eyes.
Perhaps it was true that Franceline
had ceased to love Clide. When
our will is firmly set upon self-conquest
we are apt to fancy it
achieved. But conquest does not
of necessity bring joy, or even
peace. Nothing is so terrible as
a victory, except a defeat, was a
great captain’s cry on surveying the
bloody field of yesterday’s battle.
The frantic effort, the bleeding trophies
may inflict a death-wound on
the conqueror as fatal, in one
sense, as defeat. We see the
“good fight” every day leading to
such issues. Brave souls fight and
carry the day, and then go to reap
their laurels where “beyond these
voices there is peace.” Franceline
had gained a victory, but there was
no rejoicing in the triumph. Her
heart plained still of its wounds;
if she did not hear it, it was because
she would not; it still bemoaned
its hard fate, its broken
cup of happiness.</p>

<p>She rose up from this illness,
however, happier than she had
been for months. It was difficult
to believe that the period which
had worked such changes to her
inward life counted only a few
months; it seemed like years, like
a lifetime, since she had first met
Clide de Winton. She resumed
her calmly busy little life as before
the break had come that suspended
its active routine. By Dr. Blink’s
desire the teaching class was suppressed,
and the necessity of guarding
against cold prevented her doing
much amongst the sick; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
this extra leisure in one way enabled
her to increase her work in
another; she devoted it to writing
with her father; this never tired
her, she affirmed&mdash;it only interested
and amused her.</p>

<p>The advisability of a trip to some
southern spot in France or Italy
had been suggested by Dr. Blink;
but the proposal was rejected by
his patient in such a strenuous and
excited manner that he forebore to
press it. He noticed also an expression
of sudden pain on M. de
la Bourbonais’ countenance, accompanied
by an involuntary deep-drawn
sigh, that led him to believe
there must be pecuniary impediments
in the way of the scheme,
notwithstanding Sir Simon’s assurance
to the contrary. The <i lang="fr">émigré</i>
was universally looked upon as a
poor man. Who else would live as
he did? Still Sir Simon must have
known what he was saying. However,
as it happened, the cold
weather, which was now setting in
pretty sharp, was by no means favorable
to travelling, so the doctor
consented willingly enough to abide
by the patient’s circumstances and
wishes. A long journey in winter is
always a high price for an invalid to
pay for the benefit of a warm climate.</p>

<p>In the first days of December,
Sir Simon took flight from Dullerton
to Nice. Lady Rebecca was
spending the winter at Cannes, and
as Mr. Simpson reported that “her
ladyship’s health had declined visibly
within the last month,” it was
natural that her dutiful step-son
should desire to be within call in
case of any painful eventuality. If
the climate of the sunny Mediterranean
town happened to be a very
congenial winter residence to him,
so much the better. It is only fair
that a man should have some compensation
for doing his duty.</p>

<p>The day before he started Sir
Simon came down to The Lilies.</p>

<p>“Raymond,” he said, “you have
sustained a loss lately; you must
be in want of money; now is the
time to prove yourself a Christian,
and let others do unto you as you
would do unto them. You offered
me money once when I did not
want it; I offer it to you now that
you do.” And he pressed a bundle
of notes into the count’s hands.</p>

<p>But Raymond crushed them back
into his. “Mon cher Simon! I do
not thank you. That would be ungrateful;
it would look as if I were
surprised, whereas I have long
since come to take brotherly kindness
as a matter of course from
you. But in truth I do not want
this money; I give you my word I
don’t!”</p>

<p>“If you pledge your word, I
must believe you, I suppose,” returned
the baronet; “but promise
me one thing&mdash;if you should want it,
you will let me know?”</p>

<p>“I promise you I will.”</p>

<p>Sir Simon with a sigh, which
Raymond took for reluctance, but
which was really one of relief, replaced
the notes in his waistcoat
pocket. “I had better leave you a
blank check all the same,” he said;
“you might happen to want it, and
not be able to get a letter to me at
once. There is no knowing where
the vagabond spirit may lead me,
once I am on the move. Give me
a pen.” And he seated himself at
the desk.</p>

<p>Raymond protested; but it was
no use, Sir Simon would have
his own way; he wrote the blank
check and saw it locked up in the
count’s private drawer. M. de la
Bourbonais argued from this reckless
committal of his signature that
the baronet’s finances were in a
flourishing condition, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
greatly rejoiced. Alas! if the
truth were known, they had never
been in a sorrier plight. He had offered
the bank-notes in all sincerity,
but if Raymond had accepted
it, Sir Simon would have been at
his wit’s end to find the ready
money for his journey. But he
kept this dark, and rather led his
friend to suppose him flush of
money; it was the only chance of
getting him to accept his generosity.</p>

<p>“Mind you keep me constantly
informed how Franceline gets on,”
were his parting words; and M.
de la Bourbonais promised.</p>

<p>She got on in pretty much the
same way for some time. Languid
and pale, but not suffering; and
she had no cough, and no return of
the symptoms that had alarmed
them all so much. Angélique
watched her as a cat watches a
mouse, but even her practised eye
could detect no definite cause for
anxiety.</p>

<p>One morning, about a fortnight
after Sir Simon’s departure, Franceline
was alone in the little sitting-room&mdash;her
father had gone to do
some shopping for her in the town,
as it was too cold for her to venture
out&mdash;when Sir Ponsonby
Anwyll called. The moment she
saw him she flushed up, partly with
surprise, partly with pleasure. A
casual observer would have concluded
this to be a good sign for the
visitor; a male friend would have
unhesitatingly pronounced him a
lucky dog. Ponsonby himself felt
slightly elated.</p>

<p>“I heard you were ill,” he said,
“and as I am at home on leave for
a few days, I could not resist coming
to inquire for you. You are
not displeased with me for coming?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed; it is very kind of
you. I am glad to see you,” Franceline
replied with bright, grateful
eyes.</p>

<p>Hope bounded up high in Ponsonby.</p>

<p>“They told me you had been
very ill. I hope it is not true.
You don’t look it,” he said anxiously.</p>

<p>“I have been frightening them a
little more than it was worth; but
I am quite well now. How is
Lady Anwyll?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, she’s just as usual;
in very good health and a tremendous
bustle. You know I always
put the house topsy-turvy when I
come down. Not that I mean to do
it; it seems to come of itself as a
natural consequence of my being
there,” he explained, laughing. “Is
M. de la Bourbonais quite well?”</p>

<p>“Quite well. He will be in presently;
he is only gone to make a
few purchases for me.”</p>

<p>“How anxious he must have
been while you were ill!”</p>

<p>“Dear papa! yes he was.”</p>

<p>“Do you ride much now?”</p>

<p>“Not at all. I am forbidden to
take any violent exercise for the
present.”</p>

<p>All obvious subjects being now
exhausted, there ensued a pause.
Ponsonby was the first to break it.</p>

<p>“Have you forgiven me, Franceline?”
he said, looking at her tenderly,
and with a sort of sheepish
timidity.</p>

<p>“Indeed I have; forgiven and
forgotten,” she replied; and then
blushing very red, and correcting
herself quickly: “I mean there was
nothing to forgive.”</p>

<p>“That’s not the sort of forgiveness
I want,” said Ponsonby, growing
courageous in proportion as she
grew embarrassed. “Franceline, why
can you not like me a little? I
love you so much; no one will ever
love you better, or as well!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>She shook her head, but said nothing,
only rose and went to the
window. He followed her.</p>

<p>“You are angry with me again!”
he exclaimed, and was going to
break out in entreaties to be forgiven;
when stooping forward he
caught sight of her face. It was
streaming with tears!</p>

<p>“There, the very mention of it
sets you crying! Why do you hate
me so?”</p>

<p>“I do not hate you. I never
hated you! I wish with all my
heart I could love you! But I cannot,
I cannot! And you would not
have me marry you if I did not love
you? It would be false and selfish
to accept your love, with all it would
bring me, and give so little in return?”
She turned her dark eyes on
him, still full of tears, but unabashed
and innocent, as if he had been
a brother asking her to do something
unreasonable.</p>

<p>“So little!” he cried, and seizing
her hand he pressed it to his lips;
“if you knew how thankful I would
be for that little! What am I but
an awkward lout at best! But I
will make you happy, Franceline;
I swear to you I will! And your
father too. I will be as good as a
son to him.”</p>

<p>She made no answer but the
same negative movement of her
head. She looked out over the
winter fields with a dreamy expression,
as if she only half heard him,
while her hand lay passively in
his.</p>

<p>“Say you will be my wife! Accept
me, Franceline!” pleaded the
young man, and he passed his arm
around her.</p>

<p>The action roused her; she
snatched away her hand and started
from him. It was not aversion
or antipathy, it was terror that dictated
the movement. Something
within her cried out and forbade
her to listen. She could no more
control the sudden recoil than she
could control the tears that gushed
out afresh, this time with loud sobs
that shook her from head to foot.</p>

<p>“Good heavens! what have I
done?” exclaimed Ponsonby, helpless
and dismayed. “Shall I go
away? shall I leave you?”</p>

<p>“Oh! it is nothing. It is over
now,” said Franceline, her agitation
quieted instantaneously by
the sight of his. She dashed the
tears from her cheeks impatiently;
she was vexed with herself for
giving way so before him. “Sit
down; you are trembling all over,”
said the young man; and he gently
forced her into a chair. “I am sorry
I said anything; I will never
mention the subject again without
your permission. Shall I go away?”</p>

<p>“It would be very ungracious to
say ‘yes,’” she replied, trying to
smile through the tears that hung
like raindrops on her long lashes;
“but you see how weak and foolish
I am.”</p>

<p>“My poor darling! I will go and
leave you. I have been too much
for you. Only tell me, may I come
soon again&mdash;just to ask how you
are?”</p>

<p>She hesitated. To say yes
would be tacitly to accept him;
yet it was odious to turn him off
like this without a word of kindly
explanation to soften the pang.
Ponsonby could not read these
thoughts, so he construed her hesitation
according to the immemorial
logic of lovers.</p>

<p>“Well, never mind answering
now,” he said; “I won’t bother you
any more to-day. You will present
my respects to the count, and say
how sorry I was not to see him.”</p>

<p>He held out his hand for good-by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>“You will meet him on the road,
I dare say,” said Franceline, extending
hers. “You will not tell
him how I have misbehaved to
you?”</p>

<p>The shy smile that accompanied
the request emboldened Ponsonby to
raise the soft, white hand to his lips.
Then turning away he overturned a
little wicker flower-stand, happily
with no injury to the sturdy green
plant, but with considerable damage
to the dignity of his exit.</p>

<p>Perhaps you will say that Mlle.
de la Bourbonais behaved like a
flirt in parting with a discarded
lover in this fashion. It is easy
for you to say so. It is not so easy
for a woman with a heart to inflict
unmitigated pain on a man who
loves her, and whose love she at
least requites with gratitude, esteem,
and sisterly regard.</p>

<p>Sir Ponsonby met the count on
the road; he made sure of the encounter
by walking his horse up
and down the green lane which
commanded the road from Dullerton
to The Lilies. What passed
between them remained the secret
of themselves and the winter thrush
that perched on the brown hedge
close by and sang out lustily to the
trees and fields while they conversed.</p>

<p>M. de la Bourbonais made no
comment on his daughter’s tear-stained
cheeks when he came home;
but taking her face between his
hands, as he was fond of doing, he
gave one wistful look, kissed it,
and let it go.</p>

<p>“How long you have been away,
petit père! Shall we go to our
writing now?” she inquired cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Art thou not tired, my child?”</p>

<p>“Tired! What have I done to
tire me?”</p>

<p>She sat down at his desk, and
nothing was said of Sir Ponsonby
Anwyll’s visit.</p>

<p class="break">The excitement of that day’s interview
told, nevertheless, on Franceline.
It left her nervous, and weaker
than she had been since her recovery.
These symptoms escaped
her father’s notice, and they would
have escaped Angélique’s, owing to
Franceline’s strenuous efforts to
conceal them, if a slight cough had
not come to put her on the <i lang="fr">qui vive</i>
more than ever. It was very slight
indeed, only attacking her in the
morning when she awoke, and quite
ceasing by the time she was dressed
and down-stairs. Franceline’s
room was at one end of the cottage;
Angélique slept next to her;
and at the other end, with the
stairs intervening, was the count’s
room. He was thus out of ear-shot
of the sound, which, however rare
and seemingly unimportant, would
have filled him with alarm. Franceline
treated it as a trifle not
worth mentioning; but when her
old <i lang="fr">bonne</i> insisted on taking her
discreetly to Dr. Blink and having
his opinion about it, she gave in to
humor her. The doctor once more
applied his stethoscope, and then,
smiling that grim, satisfied smile
of his that was so reassuring to patients
till they had seen it practised
on others and found out it was
a fallacy, remarked:</p>

<p>“We are glad to be able to assure
you again that there is nothing
to be frightened at; no mischief
that cannot be forestalled by care,
and docility to our instructions,” he
added emphatically. “We must order
you some tonics, and you must
take them regularly. How is the
appetite?” turning to Angélique,
who stood by devouring the oracle’s
words and watching every line
of his features with a shrewd, almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
vicious expression of mistrust
on her brown face.</p>

<p>“Ah! the appetite. She will not
be eating many; she will be wanting
dainty plates which I cannot
make,” explained the Frenchwoman,
sticking pertinaciously to
the future tense, as usual when she
spoke English.</p>

<p>“Invalids are liable to those caprices
of the palate,” remarked Dr.
Blink blandly; “but Miss Franceline
will be brave and overcome
them. Dainty dishes are not always
the most nourishing, and nourishment
is necessary for her; it is essential.”</p>

<p>“That is what I will be telling
mamselle,” assented Angélique;
“but she will not be believing
me. I will be telling her
every day the strength is in the
bouillon; but she will be making a
grimace and saying ‘Pshaw!’”</p>

<p>The last word was uttered with a
grimace so expressive that Franceline
burst out laughing, and the
pompous little doctor joined in it
in spite of his dignity. She promised
to do her best to obey him
and overcome her dislike to the
bouillon, Angélique’s native panacea,
and to other substantial food.</p>

<p>But she found it very hard to
keep the promise. It required
something savory to tempt her
weak appetite. Angélique saw she
was doing her best, and never pressed
the poor child needlessly; but
she would groan over the plate as
she removed it, sometimes untouched.
“I used to think myself
a ‘blue ribbon’ until now,” she
said once to Franceline, with an impatient
sigh; “but I am at the end
of my talent; I can do nothing
to please mamselle.” And then
she would long for Sir Simon to
come home. It happened unluckily
that the professed artist who
presided over the kitchen at the
Court was taking a holiday during
his master’s absence. Angélique
would have scorned to invoke the
skill of the subaltern who replaced
him, but she had a profound admiration
for the <i lang="fr">chef</i> himself, and,
though an Englishman, she bowed
unreservedly to his superior talents.
The belief was current that Sir Simon
would spend the Christmas at
Dullerton; he always did when not
at too great a distance at that time.
It was the right thing for an English
gentleman to do, and his bitterest
foe would not accuse the
baronet of failing to act up to that
standard.</p>

<p>This year, however, it was not
possible. The weather was glorious
at Nice and it was anything
but that at Dullerton, and the long
journey in the cold was not attractive.
He wrote home desiring
the usual festivities to be arranged
according to the old custom of the
place; coals and clothing were to
be distributed <i lang="la">ad libitum</i>; the fatted
calf was to be killed for the
tenantry, and everybody was enjoined
to eat, drink, and be merry
in spite of the host’s absence.
They conscientiously followed these
hospitable injunctions, but it was a
grievous disappointment that Sir
Simon was not in their midst to
stimulate the conviviality by his
kindly and genial presence. Pretty
presents came to The Lilies, but
they did not bring strength to
Franceline. She grew more transparent,
more fragile-looking, as the
days went on. Angélique held private
conferences with Miss Merrywig,
and that lady suggested that
any of the large houses in the
neighborhood would be only too
delighted to be of any use in sending
jellies flavored with good strong
wine. There was nothing so nourishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
for an invalid; Miss Merrywig
would speak to one where
there was a capital cook. But Angélique
would not hear of it. No,
no! Much as she longed for the
jelly she dared not get it in this
way. M. le Comte would never
forgive her. “He will be so proud,
M. le Comte! He will be a
Scotchman! He will not be confessing
even to me that he wants
nothing. But Monsieur Simon will
be coming; he will be coming soon,
and then he will be making little
plates for mamselle every day.”
Meantime she and Franceline did
their best to hide from Raymond
this particular reason for desiring
their friend’s return. But he noticed
that she ate next to nothing,
and that she often signed to Angélique
to remove her plate on which
the food remained untasted. Once
he could not forbear exclaiming:
“Ah! if we were in Paris I could
get some <i lang="fr">friandise</i> to tempt thee!”</p>

<p>In the middle of January one
morning a letter came from Sir
Simon, bearing the London postmark.</p>

<p>He had been obliged to come to
England on pressing business of a
harassing nature.</p>

<p>“Is Sir Simon coming home,
petit père?” inquired Franceline
eagerly, as her father opened the
letter.</p>

<p>“Yes; but only for a day. He
will be here after to-morrow, and
fly away to Nice the next day.”</p>

<p>“How tiresome of him! But it
is better to see him for a day than
not at all. Does he say what hour he
arrives? We will go and meet him.”</p>

<p>“It will be too late for thee to be
out, my child. He comes by the
late afternoon train, just in time to
dress for dinner and receive us all.
He has invited several friends in
the neighborhood to dine.”</p>

<p>“What a funny idea! And he is
only coming for the day?”</p>

<p>“Only for the day.”</p>

<p>Raymond’s eyebrows closed like
a horseshoe over his meditative
eyes as he folded the baronet’s letter
and laid it aside. There was
more in it than he communicated
to Franceline. It was the old
story; money tight, bills falling
due, and no means of meeting
them. Lady Rebecca had taken a
fresh start, thanks to an Italian
quack who had been up from Naples
and worked wonders with some diabolical
elixir&mdash;diabolical beyond a
doubt, for nothing but the black-art
could explain the sudden and
extraordinary rally; she was all but
dead when the quack arrived&mdash;so
Mr. Simpson heard from one of
her ladyship’s attendants. Simpson
himself was terribly put out by the
news; it overturned all his immediate
plans; he saw no possibility of
any longer avoiding extremities.
Extremities meant that the principal
creditor, a Jew who had lent a
sum of thirty thousand pounds on
Sir Simon’s life-interest in Dullerton,
at the rate of twenty per cent,
was now determined to wait no
longer for his arrears of twenty per
cent, but turn the baronet out of
possession and sell his life-interest
in the estate. This sword of Damocles
had been hanging over his
debtor’s head for the last ten years.
It was to meet this usurious interest
periodically that Sir Simon was
driven to such close quarters. He
had up to this time contrived to answer
the demand&mdash;Heaven and Mr.
Simpson alone knew at what sacrifices.
But now he had come to a
point beyond which even he declared
he could not possibly carry
his client. He had tried to negotiate
post-obit bills on Lady Rebecca’s
fifty thousand pounds, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the Jews were too sharp for that.
Lady Rebecca was sole master of
her fifty thousand pounds, and
might leave it to whom she liked.
She had made her will bequeathing
it to her step-son, and <em>he</em> was morally
as certain of ultimately possessing
the money as if it were entailed;
but moral security is no security at
all to a money-lender. The money
was <em>not</em> entailed; Lady Rebecca
might take it into her head to alter
her will; she might leave it to a
quack doctor, or to some clever
sycophant of an attendant. There
is no saying what an old lady of
seventy-five may not do with fifty
thousand pounds. Sir Simon pshawed
and pooh-poohed contemptuously
when Simpson enumerated these
arguments against the negotiation
of the much-needed P. O. bills;
but it was no use. Israel was inexorable.
And now one particular
member of the tribe called Moses
to witness that if he were not paid
his “twenty per shent” on the first
of February, he would seize upon
the life-interest of Dullerton Court
and make its present owner a bankrupt.
He could sell nothing, either
in the house or on the estate; the
plate and pictures and furniture
were entailed. If this were not the
case, things need not have come to
this with Sir Simon. Two of those
Raphaels in the great gallery would
have paid the Jew principal and
interest together; but not a spoon
or a hearth-brush in the Court
could be touched; everything belonged
to the heir. No mention
has hitherto been made of
that important person, because
he in no way concerns this story,
except by the fact of his existence.
He was a distant kinsman
of the present baronet, who had
never seen him. He was in diplomacy,
and so lived always abroad.
People are said to dislike their
heirs.</p>

<p>If Sir Simon disliked any human
being, it was his. He did not dislike
Lady Rebecca; he was only out
of patience with her; she certainly
was an aggravating old woman&mdash;living
on to no purpose, that he
could see, except to frustrate and
harass him. Yet he had kindly
thoughts of her; he had only cold
aversion towards the man who was
waiting for his own death to come
and rule in his stead. He had
never spoken of him to M. de la
Bourbonais except to inform him
that he existed, and that he stood
in his way on many occasions. In
the letter of this morning he spoke
of him once more. The letter was
a long one, and calmer than any
previous effusion of the kind that
Raymond remembered. There
was very little vituperation of the
duns, or even of the chief scoundrel
who was about to tear away
the veil that had hitherto concealed
the sores and flaws in the popular
landlord’s life. This was what he
felt most deeply in it all; the disgrace
of being shown up as a sham&mdash;a
man who had lived like a prince
while he had been in reality a beggar,
in debt up to his ears, and who
was now about to be made a bankrupt.
Raymond had never before
understood the real nature of his
friend’s embarrassment; he was
shocked and distressed more than
he could express. It was not the
moment to judge him; to remember
the reckless extravagance, the
criminal want of prudence, of conscience,
that had brought him to
this pass. He only thought of the
friend of his youth, the kind, faithful,
delightful companion who had
never failed in friendship, whatever
his other sins may have been. And
now he was ruined, disgraced before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
the world, going to be driven
forth from his ancestral home
branded as a life-long sham. Raymond
could have wept for pity.
Then it occurred to him with a
strange pang that he was to dine
with Sir Simon the next day; the
head cook had been telegraphed
for to prepare the dinner; there
was to be a jovial gathering of
friends to “cheer him up.” What
a mystery it was, this craving for
being cheered up, as if the process
were a substantial remedy that in
some way helped to pay debts, or
postpone payment! The count
was too sad at heart to smile. He
rose from the breakfast-table with a
sigh, and was leaving the room
when Franceline linked her hands
on his arm, and said, looking up
with an anxious face:</p>

<p>“It is a long letter, petit père; is
there any bad news?”</p>

<p>“There is hardly any news at
all,” he replied evasively. In truth
there was not.</p>

<p>“Then why do you look so sad?”</p>

<p>“Why dost thou look so pale?”
was the reply. And he smiled tenderly
and sighed again as he kissed
her forehead.</p>

<h3>A PRECURSOR OF MARCO POLO.</h3>

<p>The merchants and missionaries
who were the first travellers and
ambassadors of Christian times little
thought, absorbed as they were
in the object of their quest, how
large a share of interest in the eyes
of posterity would centre in the
quaint observations, descriptions,
and drawings which they were able
incidentally to gather or make.
Marco Polo’s name, and even those
of his father and uncle, Niccolo and
Matteo Polo, are well known, and
are associated with all that barbaric
magnificence the memory of which
had a great share in keeping alive the
perseverance of subsequent explorers.
It was fitting that traders in
jewels should reach the more civilized
and splendid Tartars, and no
doubt their store of rich presents,
and their garments of ample dimensions
as well as fine texture, would
prove a passport through tribes so
passionately acquisitive as the Tartars
seem to have been. Nomads
are not always simple-minded or unambitious.
The Franciscan whose
travels come just between the expedition
of the elder Polo and the
more famous Marco&mdash;Friar William
Rubruquis&mdash;did not have the
good-luck to see the wonders his
successor described; but he mentions
repeatedly that his entertainers
made reiterated and minute
inquiries as to the abundance of
flocks and herds in the country he
came from, and that they wondered&mdash;rather
contemptuously&mdash;at the
presents of sweet wine, dried fruits,
and delicate cakes which were all
he had to offer their great princes.</p>

<p>Rubruquis was traveller, missionary,
and ambassador, but in the
two pursuits denoted by the last-mentioned
titles his success was
but small. As a traveller, however,
he was hardy, persevering, and observant.
Though not bred a horseman,
he often rode thirty leagues a
day, and half the time at full gallop,
he says. His companions,
monks like himself, could not
stand the fatigue, and both, at different
intervals, parted company from
him. But Rubruquis was young and
strong, though, as he himself says,
corpulent and heavy; and, above all,
he was enterprising. He was not
more than five-and-twenty when he
started on his quest of the Christian
monarch whom all the rulers of
Europe firmly believed in, and
whose name has come down to us
as Prester John.</p>

<p>Born in 1230, he devoted himself
early to the church, and during the
Fourth Crusade went on a pilgrimage
to the Holy Land. His real
name was Ruysbroek, but, according
to the unpatriotic fashion of
the times, he Latinized it into Rubruquis.
S. Louis, King of France,
eager for the Christian alliance
which the supposed Prester John
would be able to enter into with
him, had once already sent an embassy
of monks to seek him; but
they had failed to perform a sixth
part of the journey set down for
them, and had heard no tidings
of a monarch answering to the description.
The king, nothing daunted,
determined to send another embassy
on a voyage of discovery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Vague news of a Christian Tartar
chief, by name Sartach, had come
to him; probably the toleration
extended by the Tartars to Christians&mdash;a
contrast to the behavior of
most Saracenic chiefs&mdash;led to this
obstinate belief in a remote Christian
empire of the East.</p>

<p>William de Rubruquis, Bartholomew
of Cremona, and a companion
named Andrew, all Franciscan
friars, were chosen for this new expedition.
On the 7th of May, 1253
(says his narrative, though it has
since been calculated that, as S.
Louis was a captive at the time, the
date 1255 is more likely to be correct),
the travellers, having crossed
the Black Sea from Constantinople,
landed at Soldaia, near Cherson.
The king, somewhat unwisely as it
proved, had told his envoy to represent
himself as a private individual
travelling on his own account.
But the Tartars were acute and
jealous of foreigners; they knew
that travelling entailed too much
fatigue and danger to be undertaken
simply for pleasure, and they had
small regard for any stranger, unless
the representative of a prince. They
guessed his mission, and taxed him
with it, till he was obliged to acknowledge
that he was the bearer
of letters from the Christian King
of France to the mighty khan, Sartach.
But though the people do
not seem to have taken him for a
private person, they were puzzled
by the poverty of his dress and the
scantiness of the presents he offered
them. Even small dignitaries
expected to be royally propitiated.
He explained his vow of poverty
to them, but this did not impress
the Tartars as favorably as he wished.
Still, he met with nothing but
civility and hospitality.</p>

<p>Rubruquis says that Soldaia was
a great mart for furs, which the
Russians exchanged with the merchants
of Constantinople for silks,
cotton, spices, etc. The third day
after his departure he met a wandering
tribe, “among whom being
entered,” he says, “methought I
was come into a new world.”</p>

<p>He goes on to describe their
houses on wheels, no despicable or
narrow habitations, even according
to modern ideas:</p>

<p>“Their houses, in which they
sleep, they raise upon a round
foundation of wickers artificially
wrought and compacted together,
the roof consisting of wickers also
meeting above in one little roundel,
out of which there rises upwards a
neck like a chimney, which they cover
with white felt; and often they lay
mortar or white earth upon the felt
with the powder of bones, that it
may shine and look white; sometimes,
also, they cover their houses
with black felt. This cupola …
they adorn with a variety of pictures.
Before the door they hang
a felt curiously painted over; for
they spend all their colored felt in
painting vines, trees, birds, and
beasts thereupon. These houses
they make so large that they contain
thirty feet in breadth; for, measuring
once the breadth between the
wheel-ruts, … I found it to be
twenty feet over, and when the
house was upon the cart it stretched
over the wheels on each side
five feet at least. I told two-and-twenty
oxen in one draught, drawing
an house upon a cart, and
eleven more on the other side.
(Two rows, one in front of the
other, we suppose.) … A fellow
stood in the door of the house,
driving the oxen.”</p>

<p>Sometimes a woman drove, or
walked at the head of the leaders
to guide them. “One woman will
guide twenty or thirty carts at once;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
for their country is very flat, and
they fasten the carts with camels
or oxen one behind another. A
girl sits in the foremost cart, driving
the oxen, and all the rest of
themselves follow at a like pace.
When they come to a place which
is a bad passage, they loose them,
and guide them one by one.…”</p>

<p>The baggage was so arranged as
to be taken through the smaller
rivers of Asia without being injured
or wetted. It consisted of square
chests of wicker-work, with a hollow
lid or cover of the same, “covered
with black felt, rubbed over with
tallow or sheep’s milk to keep the
rain from soaking through, which
they also adorn with painting or
white feathers.” These were placed
on carts with very high wheels, and
drawn by camels instead of oxen.
The encampment was like a large
village, well defended by palisades
formed of the carts off which the
houses had been taken, and which
were drawn up in two compact lines,
one in front and one in the rear of
the dwellings, “as it were between
two walls,” says our traveller. A rich
Tartar commonly had one hundred,
or even two hundred, such cart-houses.
Each house had several
small houses belonging to it, placed
behind it, serving as closets, store-rooms,
and sleeping chambers, and
often as many as two hundred
chests and their necessary carts.
This made immense numbers of
camels and oxen for draught necessary;
and, besides, there were the
animals for food and milk, and the
horses for the men. They had
cow’s milk and mare’s milk, two
species of food which they used
very differently, and even made of
social and religious importance.
Only the men were allowed to milk
the mares, while the women attended
to the cows; and any interchange
of these offices would have been
deemed, in a man, unpardonable
effeminacy, and in a woman indelicacy.
At the door of the houses
stood two tutelary deities, monsters
of both sexes. The cow’s milk
served for the food of women and
children, while the mare’s milk was
made into a fermented liquor called
cosmos. This was supposed to
make a heathen of the man who
drank it; for the Nestorian Christians
found among them, “who keep
their own laws very strictly, will
not drink thereof; they account
themselves no Christians after they
have once drunk of it; and their
priests reconcile them to the church
as if they had renounced the Christian
faith.”</p>

<p>This cosmos was made thus:
The milk was poured into a large
skin bag, and the bag beaten with a
wooden club until the milk began
to ferment and turn sour. The
bag was then shaken and cudgelled
again until most of it turned to butter;
after which the liquid was supposed
to be fit for drinking. Rubruquis
evidently liked it; says it
was exhilarating to the spirits, and
even intoxicating to weak heads;
pungent to the taste, “like raspberry
wine,” but left a flavor on the palate
“like almond-milk.” Cara-cosmos,
a rarer quality of the same, and reserved
for the chiefs only, was produced
by prolonging the beating
of the bag until the coagulated
portions subsided to the bottom.
These drinks were received as tribute
or taxes. Baatu, a chief with
sixteen wives, received the produce
of three thousand mares daily, besides
a quantity of common cosmos,
a bowl of which almost always stood
on the threshold of every rich man’s
house. The Tartars often drank of
it to excess, and their banquets were
relieved by music.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>At these feasts, in which both
sexes participated, the guests clapped
their hands and danced to the
music, the men before their host,
the women before his principal
wife. The host always drank first.
The moment he put his lips to the
bowl of cosmos, his cup-bearer
cried aloud “Ha!” and the musicians
struck up. This almost sounds
like a mediæval Twelfth-night banquet,
when all the guests rose
and shouted, “The king drinks!”
and then drained their goblets in
imitation of the monarch of the
night. The Tartars respectfully
waited till the lord of the feast had
finished his draught, when the cup-bearer
again cried “Ha!” and the
music ceased. After a pause, the
guests, male and female, drank round
in turns, each one to the sound of
music, with a pause and silence before
the next person took up the
cup. This fashion of drinking continued
unchanged for many centuries,
and later travellers, amid the
increased pomp of the court of the
Tartar emperors of China, found it
still in force&mdash;music, cries, pauses,
and all. We have also seen, not
many years ago, on the occasion of
the marriage of the late young emperor
of China, illustrations of the
wedding procession, representing
immensely wide carts, drawn by
eleven oxen abreast, laden with
costly state furniture; and if we take
away the pomp and gilding, the picture
is not unlike that of the Tartar
camp-carts seen by our traveller.
Rubruquis hints that the Tartars
were not a temperate people; they
drank much and not cleanly, and
the way of “inviting” a person to
drink was to seize his ears and
pull them forcibly. The sweet
wine, of which the monk had a small
supply, pleased them very well, but
they thought him not lavish enough
in his hospitality; for once, on his
offering the master of the house
one flagon of this wine, the man
gravely drained it and asked for
another, saying that “a man does
not go into a house with one foot.”
In return, however, they did not give
him much to eat; but perhaps he
suffered hunger rather from his prejudice
to the meat they ate than
from their niggardliness in giving.
He at last learned to eat horse-flesh,
but was disgusted at his friends’ eating
the bodies of animals that had
died of disease. The Tartars were
honest enough, and, never even took
things by force; but they begged for
everything that took their fancy as
unblushingly as some of Paul Du
Chaillu’s negroes in Africa. It
surprised them to be refused anything&mdash;knives,
gloves, purses, etc.&mdash;and,
when gratified, never thought
it necessary to thank their guests.</p>

<p>After a while Rubruquis met the
carts of Zagatai, one of the chieftains,
to whom he brought a letter
from the Emperor of Constantinople.
Here the Tartars asked “what
we had in our carts&mdash;whether it
were gold, or silver, or rich garments”;
and both Zagatai and his
interpreter were haughtily discontented
at finding that at least some
garment of value was not forthcoming.
This is not wonderful,
considering the wealth of their own
great khans, of whom a later one,
Kooblai, so celebrated in Marco
Polo’s travels, gave his twelve lords,
twelve times in the year, robes of
gold-colored silk, embroidered with
gold and precious stones. Zagatai,
however, received the ambassador
graciously. “He sat on his bed,”<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
says Rubruquis, “holding a musical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
instrument in his hand, and his
wife sat by him, who, in my opinion,
had cut and pared her nose
between the eyes, that she might
seem to be more flat-nosed; for she
had left herself no nose at all in
that place, having anointed the
very scar with black ointment, as
she also did her eyebrows, which
sight seemed to me most ugly.…
I besought him that he would accept
this small gift at our hands,
excusing myself that I was a monk,
and that it was against our profession
to possess gold, silver, or precious
garments, and therefore that
I had not any such thing to give
him, unless he would receive some
part of our victuals instead of a
blessing.” The Tartars were always
eager to receive a blessing over and
above any present. He was constantly
asked to make over them the sign
of the cross; but it is to be feared
that they looked upon it as a charm,
and of charms they couldn’t have
too many. From Zagatai, Rubruquis
went to Sartach, who said he
had no power of treating with him,
and sent him on to his father-in-law,
Baatu, the patriarch with sixteen
wives and several hundred houses.
Losing his ox-wagons and baggage
on the way&mdash;for the independent
tribes did not scruple to exact tribute
from a traveller, even if he was
a friend of their neighbors&mdash;he
never lost his courage and his determination
to sow the seeds of
truth in Tartary. He did not know
the language at first, and only
learnt it very imperfectly at the
last. Here and there a captive
Christian, mostly Hungarians, or a
Tartar who had learnt the rudiments
of Christianity during an invasion
of his tribe into Europe,
acted as interpreter. All were
uniformly kind to him. One of
them, who understood Latin and
psalmody, was in great request at
all the funerals of his neighborhood;
but the “Christianity” of
the natives was but a shred of Nestorianism
worked into a web of
paganism, so that, the farther he
advanced, the farther the great, powerful,
united Christian community
headed by Prester John seemed
to recede. The people took kindly
to Christian usages, and had some
respect for the forms and ceremonies
which the monk and his companions
endeavored to keep up;
but when it came to doctrine and
morality, they grew impatient and
unresponsive. One of Rubruquis’
interpreters often refused to do his
office. “And thus,” says the traveller,
“it caused me great chagrin
when I wished to address to them
a few words of edification; for he
would say to me, ‘You shall not
make me preach to-day; I understand
nothing of all you tell me.’
… And then he spoke the truth;
for afterwards, as I began to understand
a little of their tongue, I perceived
that when I told him one
thing he repeated another, just according
to his fancy. Therefore,
seeing it was no use to talk or
preach, I held my tongue.”</p>

<p>Hard riding was not the only
thing that distressed the ambassador
of the King of France. His companions
gave him meat that was
less than half-cooked, and sometimes
positively raw. Then the
cold began to be severe, and still
there were at least four months’
travel before him. The Tartars
were kind to him in their rough
way, and gave him some of their
thick sheepskins and hide shoes.
He had insisted on journeying
most of the time in his Franciscan
sandals, and, full of ardor for his
rule, had constantly refused gifts
of costly garments. This the Tartars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
never quite understood, but
they respected the principle which
caused him to make so many sacrifices
for the sake and furtherance of
his religion. Wherever he passed,
he and his companions endeared
themselves to the inhabitants by
many little services (doubtless also
by cures wrought by simple remedies),
and generally by their gentle,
unselfish conduct towards all men.
Rubruquis observed everything minutely
as he passed. The manners
and customs of the people interested
him, and perhaps he did not
consider them quite such barbarians
as we of later days are apt to
do. When we read the accounts
of domestic life among the majority
of people in mediæval times, and
see that refinement of manner was
less thought of than costliness of
apparel and wealth of plate and
cattle, the difference between such
manners and those of the Tartars
is not appreciable. Few in those
days were learned, and learning it
is that has always made the real
difference between a gentleman and
a boor. The marauding chieftains
of feudal times were only romantic
and titled highwaymen after all.
So were the wandering Tartars.
The difference that has since
sprung up between the descendants
of the marauding barons and
those of the Tartar chiefs is mainly
one of race. The former are of an
enterprising, improving race, the
latter of a stagnant one; and while
the European nations that then
trembled before the invading
hordes of Jengis-Khan have now
developed into intellectual superiority
over every other race in the
world, the Tartar is still, socially
and intellectually, on the same old
level, and his political advantages
have vanished with his rude warlike
superiority before the diplomacy
and the military organization
of his former victims.</p>

<p>Rubruquis noticed that among the
superstitions common in Tartary was
a belief that it was unlucky for a
visitor to touch the threshold of a
Tartar’s door. Modern travellers
assert the same of the Chinese.
Whenever our envoy paid a visit,
he deferred to this belief by carefully
stepping across the threshold
of the house or tent, without letting
any part of his person or dress
come in contact with it. Their
dress, on festive occasions, was
rich; for they traded with China,
Persia, and other southern and
eastern countries for “stuffs of silk,
cloths of gold, and cotton cloths,
which they wear in time of summer;
but out of Russia, Bulgaria, Hungaria,
and out of Chersis (all which
are northern regions and full of
woods), … the inhabitants bring
them rich and costly skins and furs
of divers sorts, which I never saw
in our countries, wherewithal they
are clad in winter.” The rough
sheepskin coats had their place also
in their toilet, and a material made
of two-thirds wool and one-third
horsehair furnished them with caps,
saddle-cloths, and felt for covering
their wagons.</p>

<p>The women’s dress was distinguished
from the men’s simply
by its greater length, and they
often rode, like the men, astride
their horses, their faces protected
by a white veil, crossing the nose
just below the eyes and descending
to the breast. Immense size and
flat noses were the great desiderata
among them. Marriage was a
mere bargain, and daughters were
generally sold to the highest bidder.
Though expert hunters, the
Tartars were scarcely what we
should call sportsmen. They hunted
on the <i lang="fr">battue</i> system, spreading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
themselves in a wide circle, and
gradually contracting this as they
drove the game before them, until
the unfortunate animals being penned
in in a small space, they were
easily shot down by wholesale.
Hawking was also in vogue among
the Tartars, and was reduced as
much to a science as in Europe.
They strenuously punished great
crimes with death, as, for instance,
murder, theft, adultery, and even
minor offences against chastity.
This, however, was less the consequence
of a regard for virtue <i lang="la">per
se</i> than of a vivid perception of
the rights of property. No code
but the Jewish and the Christian
ever protected the honor of women
for its own sake. In mourning for
the dead it is strange that violent
howling and lamentation, even on
the part of those not personally
concerned, should be a form common
to almost all nations, not only
of different religions, but of various
and widely-separated races.
The Tartars, as well as the Celts,
practised it. Rubruquis mentions
that they made various monuments
over the graves of their dead, sometimes
mere mounds or barrows of
earth, or towers of brick and even
of stone&mdash;though no stone was to
be found near the spot&mdash;and sometimes
large open spaces, paved with
stone, with four large stones placed
upright at the corners, always facing
the four cardinal points.</p>

<p>It was during winter that the envoy
arrived at the court or encampment
of Mandchu-Khan. He says
that it was at the distance of twenty
days’ journey from Cataya, or Cathay
(China), but it is difficult to
say exactly where that was. Here
Rubruquis found a number of
Nestorian priests peacefully living
under the khan’s protection, and
among them one who had only arrived
a month before the Franciscan
friar, and said he had come, in
consequence of a vision, to convert
the khan and his people. He was
an Armenian from the Holy Land.
Our missionary describes him thus
in his terse, direct way, which has
this advantage over the long-winded
and minute descriptions of our
day, that we seem to see the man
before us: “He was a monk, somewhat
black and lean, clad with a
rough hair-coat to the knees, having
over it a black cloak of bristles,
furred with spotted skins, girt with
iron under his hair-cloth.” Mandchu-Khan
was tolerant and liberal,
and rather well disposed than otherwise
to the Christian religion. His
favorite wife, whom he had lately
lost, had been a Christian, and so
was his first secretary, but both
Nestorian Christians. The khan,
or his servants&mdash;who doubtless expected
to be propitiated with the
usual gifts if they could only succeed
in wearying out the patience
of the new-comers&mdash;made the envoy
wait nine days for an audience.
The Tartars thought it strange that
a king’s ambassador should come
to court bare-foot; but a boy, a
Hungarian captive, again gave the
required and often-repeated explanation.
Before entering the large
hall, whose entrance was closed by
curtains of gayly-painted felt, the
monks were searched, to see if
they carried any concealed arms;
and then the procession formed,
the Christian missionaries entering
the khan’s presence singing the
hymn <cite>A Solis ortus cardine</cite>. The
khan, like the lesser chieftains Rubruquis
had already met, was seated
on a “bed” or divan, dressed
“in a spotted skin or fur, bright
and shining.” The multitudinous
bowings and prostrations in use at
the Chinese court were very likely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
exacted, though the envoy says in
general terms that “he had to
bend the knee.” Such simplicity
is, however, very far from the ceremonious
Oriental ideal of homage,
and it was not then, as it is now,
esteemed an honor to receive Frankish
envoys in the Frankish manner.
Mandchu first offered his guests a
drink of fermented milk, of which
they partook sparingly, not to offend
him; but the interpreter soon
made himself unfit for his office
by his indulgence in his
favorite beverage. Rubruquis stated
his mission with modest simplicity.
In his quality of ambassador
he might have resented
the delay in receiving him; he
might have complained of the familiarity
and want of respect with
which he had been often treated,
and of the advantage taken of his
gentleness and ignorance of the
language to plunder him; but he
was more than a king’s messenger.
He was intent upon preaching the
“good tidings” to the Tartars, and
only used human means to compass
a divine end. He acknowledged
that he had no rich presents nor
temporal goods to offer, but only
spiritual benefits to impart. His
practice certainly did not belie his
theory. The people never disbelieved
him, nor suspected him of
being a political emissary. But still,
he was unsuccessful. He soon perceived
that his interpreter was
blundering, and says: “I easily
found he was drunk, and Mandchu-Khan
himself was drunk also, as I
thought.” All he could obtain was
leave to remain in the country during
the cold season. Inquiries met
him on all sides as to the wealth
and state of Europe; but of religion,
beyond the few forms that
pleased their eye, the people did not
seem to think. They looked down
with lofty indifference on the faith
of those various adventurers whom
their sovereign kindly sheltered, and
ranked the Christian priests they
already knew in the same category
with conjurers and quack doctors.
The Christianity of these Nestorians
was even more imperfect than that
of the Abyssinians at the time of
the late English invasion of the unlucky
King Theodore’s dominions.
Rubruquis was horrified to find
in these priests mere superstitious
mountebanks. They mingled Tartar
rites with corrupt ceremonies of
the Catholic Church, and practised
all manner of deceptions, mixing
rhubarb with holy water as a medicinal
drink, and carrying to the
bedside of the sick lances and
swords half-drawn from their sheaths
along with the crucifix. Upon
these grounds they pretended to
the power of working miracles and
curing the sick by spiritual means
alone. The Franciscan zealously
tried to reform these abuses and to
convert the Nestorians before he
undertook to preach to the Tartars;
but here again he was unsuccessful.
The self-interest of these debased
men was in question, and truth was
little to them in comparison with
the comfort and consideration they
enjoyed as leeches.</p>

<p>A curious scene occurred while
at this encampment of the khan.
There were many Mahometans in
the country, and the sovereign, with
impartial tolerance, protected them
and their commerce as he did the
person and property of other refugees.
They, the Christians, and
some representative Tartars were
all assembled one day, by order of
Mandchu, to discuss in public the
merits of their respective faiths.
But even on this occasion no bitterness
was evinced, and the meeting,
though it turned out useless in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
a spiritual sense, ended in a friendly
banquet. Rubruquis did his
best to improve this opportunity of
teaching the truth; but the hour of
successful evangelization had not
yet struck, and much of the indifference
of the Tartars is to be attributed
to the culpable practices
of the Nestorians, whose behavior
was enough to discredit the religion
they pretended to profess. But if
the missionary, notwithstanding all
his zeal, was unable to convert the
heathens, he at least comforted and
strengthened many captive Christians.
We have already mentioned
a few of these, and in Mandchu’s
camp he met with another, a
woman from Metz in Lorraine, who
had been taken prisoner in Hungary,
and been carried back into their
own country by the invaders. She
had at first suffered many hardships,
but ended by marrying a young
Russian, a captive like herself, who
was skilful in the art of building
wooden houses. The Tartars prized
this kind of knowledge, and were
kind to the young couple, who were
now leading a tolerably comfortable
life, and had a family of three
children. To fancy their joy at
seeing a genuine Christian missionary
is almost out of our power in
these days of swift communication,
when nothing is any longer a marvel;
but if we could put ourselves in
their place, we might paint a wonderful
picture of thankfulness, surprise,
and simple, rock-like faith.
The latter part of Lent was spent
in travelling, as the khan broke
up his encampment, and went on
across a chain of mountains to a
great city, Karakorum, or Karakûm,
on the river Orchon. Every
vestige of such a city has disappeared
centuries ago, but Marco Polo
mentions it and describes its
streets, situation, defences, etc. He
arrived there nearly twenty years
later, and noticed that it was surrounded
by a strong rampart of
earth, there being no good supply
of stone in those parts.</p>

<p>The passage of the Changai
Mountains was a terrible undertaking;
the cold was intense and the
weather stormy, and the khan, with
his usual bland eclecticism, begged
Rubruquis to “pray to God in his
own fashion” for milder weather,
chiefly for the sake of the cattle.
On Palm Sunday the envoy blessed
the willow-boughs he saw on
his way, though he says there were
no buds on them yet; but they were
near the city now, and the weather
had become more promising. Rubruquis
had his eyes wide open as
he came to the first organized city
of the Tartars, as Marco Polo affirms
this to have been. It had
scarcely been built twenty years
when our monk visited it, and owed
its origin to the son and successor
of Jengis-Khan. “There were
two grand streets in it,” says Rubruquis,
“one of the Saracens, where
the fairs are kept (held), and many
merchants resort thither, and one
other street of the Cathayans
(Chinese), who are all artificers.”
Many of the latter were captives, or
at least subjects, of the khan; for the
Tartars had already conquered the
greater part of Northern China. The
khan lived in a castle or palace
outside the earthen rampart. In
Karakorum, again, the monk found
many Christians, Armenian, Georgian,
Hungarian, and even of Western
European origin. Among others
he mentions an Englishman&mdash;whom
he calls Basilicus, and who
had been born in Hungary&mdash;and a
few Germans. But the most important
personage of foreign birth
was a French goldsmith, William
Bouchier, whose wife was a Hungarian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
but of Mahometan parentage.
This Benvenuto Cellini of the East
was rich and liberal, an excellent
interpreter, thoroughly at home in
the Tartar dialects, a skilful artist,
and in high favor at court. He
had just finished a masterpiece of
mechanism and beauty which Rubruquis
thus minutely describes:
“In the khan’s palace, because it
was unseemly to carry about bottles
of milk and other drinks there, Master
William made him a great silver
tree, at the root whereof were four
silver lions, having each one pipe,
through which flowed pure cow’s
milk; and four other pipes were
conveyed within the body of the
tree unto the top thereof, and the
tops spread back again downwards,
and upon every one of them was a
golden serpent, whose tails twined
about the body of the tree. And
one of these pipes ran with wine,
another with cara-cosmos, another
with <i>ball</i>&mdash;a drink made of honey&mdash;and
another with a drink made of
rice. Between the pipes, at the
top of the tree, he made an angel
holding a trumpet, and under the
tree a hollow vault, wherein a man
might be hid; and a pipe ascended
from this vault through the tree to
the angel. He first made bellows,
but they gave not wind enough.
Without the palace walls there was
a chamber wherein the several
drinks were brought; and there
were servants there ready to pour
them out when they heard the angel
sounding his trumpet. And the
boughs of the tree were of silver,
and the leaves and the fruit. When,
therefore, they want drink, the master-butler
crieth to the angel that
he sound the trumpet. Then he
hearing (who is hid in the vault),
bloweth the pipe, which goeth to
the angel, and the angel sets his
trumpet to his mouth, and the
trumpet soundeth very shrill. Then
the servants which are in the chamber
hearing, each of them poureth
forth his drink into its proper pipe,
and all the pipes pour them forth
from above, and they are received
below in vessels prepared for that
purpose.”</p>

<p>This elaborate piece of plate
makes one think rather of the
XVIth century banquets of the
Medici and the Este than of feastings
given by a nomad Tartar in
the wilds of Central Asia. The
goldsmith was not unknown to
fame even in Europe, where he was
called William of Paris. Several
old chroniclers speak of him, and
his brother Roger was well known
as a goldsmith “living upon the
great bridge at Paris.” This clever
artist very nearly fell a victim to
the quackery of a Nestorian monk,
whereupon Rubruquis significantly
comments thus: “He entreated him
to proceed either as an apostle doing
miracles indeed, by virtue of
prayer, or to administer his potion
as a physician, according to the art
of medicine.” Besides the Tartars
and their Christian captives, Rubruquis
had opportunities of observing
the numerous Chinese, or
Cathayans, as they were called, who
have been mentioned as the artificers
of the town. There were also
knots of Siberians, Kamtchatkans,
and even inhabitants of the islands
between the extremities of Asia
and America, where at times the
sea was frozen over. Rubruquis
picked up a good deal of miscellaneous
information, chiefly about
the Chinese. He mentions their
paper currency&mdash;a fact which Marco
Polo subsequently verified&mdash;and
their mode of writing; <i>i.e.</i>, with
small paint-brushes, and each character
or figure signifying a whole
word. The standard of value of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
the Russians, he says, consisted in
spotted furs&mdash;a currency which
still exists in the remoter parts of
Siberia.</p>

<p>It was not without good reason,
no doubt, that the monk-envoy
made up his mind to leave the
country he had hoped either to
evangelize or to find already as orthodox
as his own, and ruled by
a great Christian potentate. Such
perseverance as he showed throughout
his journey was not likely to
be daunted by slight obstacles; but
finding the object of his mission as
far from attainment as when he
first entered Tartary, he at last reluctantly
left the field. Only one
European besides himself had ventured
so far&mdash;Friar Bartholomew of
Cremona; but even he shrank before
a renewal of the hardships of
mountain and desert travel, and
chose rather to stay behind with
Master William, the hospitable goldsmith,
till some more convenient
opportunity should present itself
of returning to his own country.
Rubruquis accordingly started
alone, with a servant, an interpreter,
and a guide; but though he had
asked for leave to go on Whitsunday,
the permission was delayed till
the festival of S. John Baptist, the
24th of June. The khan made
him a few trifling presents, and gave
him a complimentary letter to the
King of France; but no definite results
were obtained. The homeward
journey was long and tedious,
and the only provision made for
the sustenance of the party was a
permission from the khan to take
a sheep “once in four days, wherever
they could find it.” Sometimes
they had nothing to eat
for three days together, and only a
little cosmos to drink, and more
than once, having missed the stations
of the wandering tribes whom
they had reckoned on meeting,
even the supply of cosmos was exhausted.
About two months after
his departure from Karakorum,
Rubruquis met Sartach, the great
chief who had sheltered him for
some time on his way to the river
Don. Some belongings of the mission
having been left in Sartach’s
care, the envoy asked him to return
them, but was told they were in
charge of Baatu, Rubruquis’ other
friend and protector. Sartach was
on his way to join Mandchu-Khan,
and was of course surrounded by
the two hundred houses and innumerable
chests which belonged to
the establishment of a Tartar patriarch.
If this was not exactly
civilization, it was companionship,
and the envoy must have been glad
of a meeting which replenished his
exhausted stores and suggested
domestic comfort and abundance.
More rough travelling on horseback,
more experiences of hunger
and cold (for the autumn was already
coming on), more fording of
rivers, and the monk found himself
at Baatu’s court. It was the
16th of September&mdash;a year after he
had left the chieftain to push on
to the court of the Grand-Khan.
Here he was joyfully and courteously
received, and recovered nearly
all his property; but as the Tartars
had concluded that the whole
embassy must have perished long
ago, they had allowed some Nestorian
priest, a wanderer under the
protection now of Sartach, now of
Baatu and other khans, to appropriate
various Psalters, books, and
ecclesiastical vestments. Three
young men, Europeans, whom Rubruquis
had left behind, had nearly
been reduced to bondage under
the same pretext, but they had
not suffered personal ill-treatment.
The kind offices of some influential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Armenians had staved off the evil
day, and the timely arrival of the
long-missing envoy secured them
their freedom. Rubruquis now
joined Baatu’s court, which was
journeying westward to a town
called Sarai, on the eastern bank
of the Volga; but the progress of
the encumbered Tartars was so
slow that he left them after a
month’s companionship, and pushed
on with his party, till he reached
Sarai on the feast of All Saints.
After this the country was almost
an unbroken desert; but our traveller
once more fell in with one of
his Tartar friends, a son of Sartach,
who was out upon a hawking
expedition, and gave him a guard
to protect him from various fierce
Mahometan tribes that infested the
neighborhood.</p>

<p>Here ended his travels in Tartary
proper; but his hardships were
far from ended yet. Through Armenia
and the territories of Turkish
and Koordish princes he journeyed
slowly and uncomfortably, in
dread of the violence of his own
guides and guards, as well as of the insults
of the populations whose country
he traversed. He says these delays
“arose in part from the difficulty
of procuring horses, but chiefly because
the guide chose to stop, often
for three days together, in one
place, for his own business; and,
though much dissatisfied, I durst
not complain, as he might have
slain me and those with me, or
sold us all for slaves, and there was
none to hinder it.”</p>

<p>Journeying across Asia Minor
and over Mount Taurus, he took
ship at last for Cyprus. Here he
learnt that S. Louis, who had
been in the Holy Land at the time
of his departure, had gone back to
France. He would very much
have wished to deliver his letters
and presents of silk pelisses and
furs to the king in person; but this
was not granted him. The provincial
of his order, whom he met at
Cyprus, desired him to write his
account and send his gifts to the
king; and as in those days there
was creeping in among the monks
a habit of restless wandering, his
superior, who was, it seems, a reformer
and strict disciplinarian,
tried the obedience and humility
of the famous traveller by sending
him to his convent at Acre, whence,
by the king’s order, he had started.
Rubruquis stood the test, but
could not forbear imploring the king,
by writing, to use his influence
with the provincial to allow him a
short stay in France and one audience
of his royal master. Little
is known of the great traveller and
pioneer after this; and whether he
ever got leave to see the king is doubtful.
He fell back into obscurity,
and it is presumed that Marco Polo
did not even know of his previous
travels over the same ground as
the Polos explored. No record of
his embassy remained but the Latin
letter addressed to S. Louis, and
even in France his fame was unknown
for many centuries. It was
not till after the invention of printing
that his adventures became fairly
known to the literary world, although
Roger Bacon, one of his
own order, had given a spirited
abstract of his travels in one of his
works. This, too, was in Latin, and
after a time became a sealed book
to the vulgar; so that it was not at
least till the year 1600 that the old
traveller’s name was again known.
Hakluyt’s <cite>Collection of Voyages and
Travels</cite> contains an English translation
of Rubruquis’ letter, and
twenty-five years later Purchas reproduced
it <i lang="la">in toto</i> from a copy
found in a college library at Cambridge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Bergeron, a French priest,
put it into French, not from the
original, but from Purchas’ English
version. Since then Rubruquis
has taken his place among the few
famous voyagers of olden times; but
from the vagueness of his language,
the lack of geographical science
in his day, and perhaps also the
mistakes of careless copyists, it is
not easy to trace his course upon
the map. One fact, however, he
ascertained and insisted upon, which
a geographical society, had it existed
in his time, would have been
glad to register, together with an
honorable mention of the discoverer&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
the nature of the great lake
called the Caspian Sea. The old
Greeks had correctly called it an
<em>inland</em> sea, but an idea had since
prevailed that it possessed some
communication with the Northern
Ocean. Rubruquis proved the contrary,
but no attention was paid
to his single assertion, and books
of geography, compiled at home
from ancient maps and MSS., without
a reference, however distant,
to the <em>facts</em> recorded by adventurous
men who had seen foreign
shores with their eyes, calmly
continued to propagate the old
error.</p>

<h3>THE LAW OF GOD AND THE REGULATIONS OF SOCIETY.<br />
<span class="smaller">SUMMARY CONSIDERATIONS ON LAW.</span></h3>

<p class="center">FROM THE FRENCH OF THE COMTE DE BREDA.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There are laws for the society of ants and of bees; how could any one suppose that there are none for
human society, and that it is left to the chance of inventing them?”&mdash;<cite>De Bonald.</cite></p>

</div>

<h4>I.&mdash;THE MODERN STATE.</h4>

<p>Never before was liberty so
much talked about; never before
was the very idea of it so utterly
lost. Tyrants have been destroyed,
it is said. This is a false assertion
it may be (or rather, is it not
certain?) that it has become more
difficult for a sovereign to govern
tyrannically, but tyranny is not
dead&mdash;quite the contrary.</p>

<p>All unlimited power is, of its own
nature, tyrannical. Now, it is such
a power that the modern state desires
to wield. The state is held up to
us as the supreme arbiter of good
and evil; and, if we believe its defenders,
it cannot err, its laws being
in every case, and at all times,
binding.</p>

<p>People have banished God from
the government of human society;
but they have made to themselves
a new god, despotic and blind,
without hearing and without voice,
whose power knows how to reach
its slaves as well in the temple as
in the public places, as well in the
palace as in the humblest cot.</p>

<p>What is there, indeed, more divine
than not to do wrong? God
alone, speaking to the human conscience,
either directly or by his
representatives, is the infallible
judge of good and evil. No
human power whatsoever can declare
all that emanates from it
to be necessarily right without
usurping the place of God, and declaring
itself the sovereign master
of the soul as well as of the body.
The last refuge of the slaves of
antiquity&mdash;the human conscience&mdash;would
no longer exist for the people
of modern times, if it were true that
every law is binding from the mere
fact of its promulgation. Hence
the modern state, but lately so
boastful, has begun to waver and
to doubt its own powers. It encounters
two principal obstacles, as
unlike in their form as in their
origin.</p>

<p>On one hand it beholds Catholics,
sustained by their knowledge
of law, its origin and its essence,
resisting passively, and preparing
themselves to submit to persecutions
without even shrinking. On
the other it meets, in these our
days, the most formidable insurrections.
There are multitudes, blind
as the state representatives&mdash;but
excusable, inasmuch as their rebellion
is against an authority which
owes its sway only to caprice
or theory&mdash;who reply thus to
power: “We are as good as you;
you have no right over us other
than that of brute force; we will
endeavor to oppose you with a
strength equal to yours; and
when we shall have gained the
victory, we will make new laws and
new constitutions, wherein all that
you call lawful shall be called unlawful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
and all that you consider
crime shall be deemed virtue.”</p>

<p>If it were true that law could
spring only from the human will,
these madmen would be reasonable
in the extreme. Thus the state is
powerless against them. It drags
on an uncertain existence, constantly
threatened with the most
terrible social wars, and enjoying a
momentary peace only on condition
of never laying down arms.
Modern armies are standing ones;
the modern police have become
veritable armies, and they sleep
neither day nor night. At this
price do our states exist, trade, grow
rich, and become satisfied with
themselves.</p>

<p>These constant commotions are
not alone the vengeance of the living
God disowned and outraged;
they are also the inevitable consequence
of that extremity of pride
and folly which has induced human
assemblies to believe that it belongs
to them to decide finally between
right and wrong.</p>

<p>In truth, “if God is not the author
of law, there is no law really
binding.” We may, for the love of
God, obey existing powers, even
though they be illegitimate; but
this submission has its limits. It
must cease the moment that the
human law prescribes anything
contrary to the law of God. As
for people without faith, we would
in vain seek for a motive powerful
enough to induce them to submit to
anything displeasing to them.</p>

<h4>II.&mdash;MODERN LIBERTY.</h4>

<p>The people of our generation
consider themselves more free,
more unrestrained, than those who
have gone before them. It is not
to our generation, however, that
the glory accrues of having first
thrown off the yoke. Our moderns
themselves acknowledge that they
have had predecessors, and they
agree with us in declaring that
“the new spirit” made its appearance
in the world about the XVIth
century.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>In truth, the only yoke which
has been cast off since then is that
of God, which seemed too heavy.
All at once thought pronounced
itself freed from the shackles of ecclesiastical
authority; but, at the
outset, it was far from intended to
deny the idea of a divine right superior
to all human right.</p>

<p>Despite the historical falsehoods
which have found utterance in our
day, it was chiefly princes who propagated
Protestantism; and, most often,
they attained their end only by
violence. When successful, they
added to their temporal title a religious
one; they made themselves
bishops or popes, and thus became
all the more powerful over
their subjects. There was no longer
any refuge from the abuse of
power of the rulers of this world;
for it was the interest of these despots
to call themselves the representatives
of God. By means of
this title they secularized dioceses,
convents, the goods of the church,
and even the ministers of their new
religion. This term was then used
to express in polite language an
idea of spoliation and of hypocritical
and uncurbed tyranny.</p>

<p>The moderns have gone farther:
they have attempted to secularize
law itself. This time, again, the
word hides a thought which, if it
were openly expressed, would shock;
the law has become atheistical,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
and not all the opposition which
the harshness of this statement has
aroused can prevent it from still
expressing a truth. The inexorable
logic of facts leads directly
from the Reformation to the Revolution.
Princes themselves sowed
the seeds of revolt which will yet
despoil them of their power and
their thrones; while as for the
people, they have gained nothing.
They are constantly tyrannized
over; but their real masters are
unknown, and their only resource
against the encroachments or the
abuse of power is an appeal to arms.</p>

<p>It is not, then, true that liberty
finds greater space in the modern
world than in the ancient Christian
world. To prove this, I need but
a single fact which has direct relation
with my subject.</p>

<p>While Europe was still enveloped
in “the darkness of the Middle
Ages,” Catholic theologians freely
taught, from all their chairs, that
“an unjust law is no law”&mdash;“Lex
injusta non est lex.” Now, are
there, at the present day, many
pulpits from which this principle,
the safeguard of all liberty and of all
independence, the protector of all
rights, and the defence of the helpless,
might be proclaimed with impunity?
Do we not see the prohibitions,
the lawsuits, the <i lang="fr">appels
comme d’abus</i> which the boldness of
such a maxim would call forth?</p>

<p>Human governments have changed
in form, but their tyranny has
not ceased to grow; and the free
men of the olden society have become
the slaves in a new order of
things&mdash;they have even reached a
point at which they know not even
in what liberty consists.</p>

<h4>III.&mdash;DIVINE ORIGIN OF LAW.</h4>

<p>I know, and I hear beforehand,
the response which the doctors of
modern rights will here give me
“Yes,” say they, “it is very true
that the Catholic Church has always
claimed the right of judging
laws and of refusing obedience to
such as displeased her; but in this
is precisely the worst abuse. That
which would domineer over human
reason, the sovereign of the world,
is tyranny <i lang="fr">par excellence</i>; this, in
truth, is the special mark of Catholicity,
and it is this which has ever
made it the religion of the ignorant
and the cowardly.”</p>

<p>Is, then, the maxim I have just
recalled the invention of Catholic
theologians? Is it true that the
teachers of the ultramontane doctrine
alone have contended that
the intrinsic worth of a law must
be sought beyond and above them,
beyond and above the human power
which proclaims it? Not only has
this elementary principle not been
devised by our theologians, but
even the pagan philosophers themselves
had reached it. Cicero but
summed up the teaching universally
received by philosophers worthy
of the name, when he said that the
science of law should not be sought
in the edicts of the pretor, nor
even in the laws of the twelve
tables; and that the most profound
philosophy alone could aid in judging
laws and teaching us their
value.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>This is not to degrade reason,
which this same Cicero has defined,
or rather described, in admirable
language. He found therein something
grand, something sublime;
he declared that it is more fit to
command than to obey; that it values
little what is merely human;
that it is gifted with a peculiar elevation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
which nothing daunts, which
yields to no one, and which is unconquerable.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>But remark, it is only with regard
to human powers and allurements
that reason shows itself so
exalted and haughty. It requires
something greater than man to
make it submit; and it <em>obeys</em> only
God or his delegates. “Stranger,”
said Plato to Clinias the Cretan,
“whom do you consider the first
author of your laws? <em>Is it a god?
Is it a man?</em>”</p>

<p>“Stranger,” replied Clinias, “it
is a god; we could not rightly accord
this title to any other.”<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>So, also, tradition tells us that
Minos went, every ninth day, to
consult Jupiter, his father, whose
replies he committed to writing.
Lycurgus wished to have his laws
confirmed by the Delphian Apollo,
and this god replied that he would
dictate them himself. At Rome
the nymph Egeria played the same
<i lang="fr">rôle</i> with Numa. Everywhere is
felt the necessity of seeking above
man the title in virtue of which
he may command his fellow-men.</p>

<p>If we turn now from the fabulous
traditions of the ancient world,
we still find an absolute truth proclaimed
by its sages; one that affirms
the existence of an eternal
law&mdash;<i lang="la">quiddam æternum</i>&mdash;which was
called the natural law, and which
serves as a criterion whereby to
judge the worth of the laws promulgated
by man.</p>

<p>Cicero declares it absurd to consider
right everything set down in
the constitutions or the laws.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
And he is careful to add that
neither is public opinion any
more competent to determine the
right.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>The sovereign law, therefore&mdash;that
which no human law may violate
without the penalty of becoming
void&mdash;has God himself for its
author.</p>

<p>The laws of states may be unjust
and abominable, and, by consequence,
bind no one. There is,
on the other hand, a natural law,
the source and measure of other
laws, originating before all ages, before
any law had been written or
any city built.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>This doctrine, to support which
I have designedly cited only pagan
authors, is also that of Catholic
theologians; for example, S. Thomas
and Suarez. But the philosophical
school of the last century has
so perverted the meaning of the
term <em>nature&mdash;law of nature</em>, that certain
Catholic authors (M. de Bonald,
for instance) have scrupled to use
the consecrated term. It is necessary,
then, to explain its true sense.</p>

<h4>IV.&mdash;NATURAL LAW ACCORDING TO PAGAN
PHILOSOPHERS.</h4>

<p>The nature of a being is that
which constitutes its fitness to attain
its end. The idea, therefore,
which a person has of the nature of
man, by consequence determines
that which he will have of his end,
and hence of the rule which should
govern his actions.</p>

<p>The materialists, for example,
who deny the immortality of the
soul, and whose horizon is bounded
by the limits of the present life, are
able to teach only a purely epicurean
or utilitarian morality.
They cannot consistently plead a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
motive higher than an immediate,
or at least a proximate, well-being;
for, what is more uncertain than
the duration of our life? In the
strikingly anti-philosophic language
of the XVIIIth century, <em>the state
of nature</em> was a hypothetical state,
at once innocent and barbarous,
anterior to all society. It is to
society that this theory attributes
the disorders of man and the
loss of certain primitive and inalienable
rights which the sect of
pseudo-philosophers boasted of
having regained, and by the conquest
whereof the corrupted and doting
France of 1789 was prostrated.</p>

<p>The philosophers of antiquity, on
the contrary, notwithstanding their
numerous errors, and despite the polytheism
which they exteriorly professed,
had arrived at so profound a
knowledge of man and his nature
that the fathers and doctors of the
church have often spoken of the
discoveries of their intellect as a
kind of <em>natural revelation</em> made to
them by God.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>We have already heard Cicero
say that the natural law is eternal,
and superior to all human laws. I
shall continue to quote him, because
of his clearness, and because he admirably
sums up the teaching of the
philosophers who preceded him.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>The sound philosophy which
should guide us&mdash;according to him,
the science of law&mdash;teaches us that it
is far more sublime to submit to
the divine mind, to the all-powerful
God, than to the emperors and
mighty ones of this earth; for it is
a kind of partnership between God
and man. Right reason (<i lang="la">ratio recta</i>)
is the same for the one and the
other; and law being nothing else
than right reason, it may be said
that one same law links us with the
gods. Now, the common law is
also the common right, and when
people have a common right they
belong, in some manner, to the
same country. We must, then, consider
this world as a country common
to the gods and to men. Man
is, in truth, like to God. And for
what end has God created and gifted
man like to himself? That he
may arrive at justice.</p>

<p>Human society is bound by one
same right, and law is the same for
all. This law is the just motive
(the right reason, <i lang="la">ratio recta</i>) of all
precepts and prohibitions; he who
is ignorant of it, whether written or
not, knows not justice. If uprightness
consisted in submission to the
written laws and constitutions of
nations, and if, as some pretend,
utility could be the measure of
good, he who expected to profit
thereby would be justified in neglecting
or violating the laws.</p>

<p>This remark is peculiarly applicable
to the present time. It is precisely
utility and the increase of
wealth or of comforts&mdash;in a word,
material interests&mdash;which the greater
number of modern legislators
have had chiefly in view; the result
is that society scarcely has the
right to feel indignant against those
who may deem it to their advantage
to disturb it. Religion, say
they, has nothing in common with
politics; the state, inasmuch as it
is a state, need not trouble itself
about God; the things of this
world should be regulated with regard
to this world, and without
reference to the supernatural. Suppose
it so; but then, in virtue of
what authority will you impose
your laws? There is no human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
power able to bend or to conquer
one human will which does not
acknowledge it.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>The basis of right is the natural
love of our fellow-beings which nature
has planted within us. Nature
also commands us to honor God.
It is not fear which renders worship
necessary; it is the bond
which exists between God and man.
If popular or royal decrees could
determine right, a whim of the multitude
might render lawful theft,
adultery, or forgery. If it be true
that a proclamation dictated by
fools can change the order of nature,
why may not evil become, one day,
good? But the sages teach that
the human mind did not invent law;
it has its birth-place in the bosom of
God, and is co-eternal with him; it
is nothing else than the unerring
reason of Jupiter himself; it is reflected
in the mind of the wise
man; it can never be repealed.</p>

<p>This “right reason which comes
to us from the gods” (<i lang="la">recta et a
numine deorum tracta ratio</i>) is what
is usually termed the <em>natural</em> law;
and the beautiful language of Cicero
recalls this magnificent verse of the
IVth Psalm: “Quis ostendit nobis
bona? Signatum est super nos
lumen vultus tui, Domine.”</p>

<h4>V.&mdash;INFLUENCE OF PANTHEISM ON MODERN
LAW.</h4>

<p>Pagan teaching, how elevated soever
it may be, is always incomplete;
and this is evident even from
the words of Cicero.</p>

<p>Since law comes from God, it is
very clear that it will be known
more or less correctly according as
our idea of God is more or less
correct. This it is that gives so
great a superiority, first, to the law
of Moses, before the coming of
Jesus Christ, and to all Christian
legislation since.</p>

<p>The Jews had not merely a vague
knowledge of the precepts of the
divine law. This law, in its principal
provisions, had been directly
revealed to them. Christians have
something better still, since the
Eternal Word was made man, and
the Word is precisely “the true
light which enlighteneth every man
coming into this world.”<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> The
philosophers of antiquity saw this
light from afar off; we have <em>beheld</em>
that of which they merely affirmed
the existence; the Jews contemplated
it as through a veil, and
awaited its coming. <span class="smcap">It</span> was made
flesh; it brought us life; “it shone
in the darkness, but the darkness
did not comprehend it.”<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>It is not the fault of the Word or
of his manifestation, says S. Thomas
on this subject, if there are minds
who see not this light. There is
here, not darkness, but closed
eyes.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>It is God himself, therefore, whom
man refuses to acknowledge when
he rejects the fundamental law,
which alone deserves the name of
law. Human pride and insolence
go beyond forgetfulness or simple
negation when they have the audacity
to put a human law in the place
of and above the divine law; which
last crime is nothing less than the
deification of man. This philosophic
consequence of the secularization
of the law was inevitable, and
is openly displayed in modern doctrines.
Atheists, properly so called,
are rare; but the present generation
is infected with Pantheism. Now,
Pantheism proclaims, without disguise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
and without shame, the divinity
of man.</p>

<p>Let us add that this error is the
only foundation upon which man
may logically rest to defend modern
rights. It produces, with regard to
constitutions and laws, two principal
effects, which it suffices but to
indicate, that every honest mind
may at once recognize their existence
and their lamentable consequences.</p>

<p>Pantheism, firstly, destroys individualities,
or, as the Germans call
them, <em>subjectivities</em>; it sweeps them
away, and causes them to disappear
in the Great Whole. Do we not
likewise see personality, simple or
associated&mdash;that is to say, individual
liberty, associations, and corporations&mdash;little
by little reduced to
annihilation by the modern idea of
the state? Does not modern theory
make also of the state another
grand whole, beside which nothing
private can exist?</p>

<p>To reach this result, they represent
the state as expressing the aggregate
of all the particular wills,
and they seek, in a pretended “general
will,” the supreme and infallible
source of law. But even were
this will as general as theory desires,
it would not be the less human, or,
by consequence, the less subject to
error. Whence comes it, then, that
they make it the sovereign arbiter
of good and evil, of truth and falsehood,
of justice and injustice?
The Pantheists reply that “God is
in man and in the world; that he
is one and the same thing with the
world; that he is identical with the
nature of things, and consequently
subject to change.” The general
will, the expression of the universal
conscience, is then a manifestation of
the divine will; and this would allow
it to change without ever erring.</p>

<p>This answers all, in truth; but it
may lead us too far. If, as says
Hegel, God is subjective&mdash;that is to
say, if He is in man, or, more exactly
still, if He is man himself and
the substance of nature&mdash;neither
right, nor law, nor justice could remain
objective. In other words, if
man is God, there is no longer any
possible distinction between good
and evil. And this conclusion has
been drawn by the learned German
socialist, Lassalle. He denies the
notion of an immutable right; he
is unwilling that we should any
longer speak of the family, property,
justice, etc., in absolute terms.
According to him, these are but
abstract and unreal generalities.
There have been, on all these subjects,
Greek, Roman, German, etc.,
ideas; but these are only historical
recollections. Ideas change, some
even disappear; and if, some day,
the universal conscience should decide
that the idea of proprietorship
has had its day, then would commence
a new era in history, during
which there could be no longer
either property or proprietors without
incurring the guilt of injustice.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
From the stand-point of
Pantheism, this reasoning is irrefutable;
and, on the other hand, we
have just seen that Pantheism alone
could justify the modern theory of
the general will, the supreme arbiter
of law.</p>

<h4>VI.&mdash;HAS THE GENERAL WILL RULED SINCE
1789?</h4>

<p>I have just quoted a socialist
whose works, though little known
in France, are of extreme importance.
Ferdinand Lassalle, a Jew
by birth, by nationality a Prussian,
is possessed of extensive knowledge,
critical genius of the highest
order, and unsparing logic. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
have seen him draw the theoretical
consequences of Pantheism applied
to law; and it will not be without
interest to know how he judges the
practical results of the modern
theory of rights, as shown in the
French Revolution. The socialists
have a special authority for speaking
of “immortal principles”; for
they admit them without hesitation,
and their teaching proved that they
comprehend them wonderfully.</p>

<p>The <cite>Declaration of the Rights of
Man</cite> is the most authentic summing
up of these famous principles;
and it is therein that the
modern theory of law will be found
most clearly stated. “Law,” says
Art. 6, “is the expression of the
general will. Every citizen has the
right of co-operating in its formation,
either personally or by his
representatives.”</p>

<p>It would seem, from this solemn
proclamation, that since then, or at
least in the first fervor of this “glorious”
revolution, the majority of
the “sovereign people” should have
been called to “form the laws.”
This has been said; it has even
been supported at the mouth of
the cannon&mdash;for, as has been wittily
remarked by M. de Maistre, “the
masters of these poor people have
had recourse even to artillery while
deriding them. They said to them:
‘You think you do not will this
law; but, be assured, you do will
it. If you dare to refuse it, we will
pour upon you a shower of shot, to
punish you for not willing what you
do will.’ And it was done.”<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>What then took place, and how
did it happen that the general will,
which had undertaken to make
fundamental and irrevocable laws,
should have accepted, in the first
five years of its freedom, three different
constitutions and a <i lang="fr">régime</i>
like that of the Reign of Terror?</p>

<p>Lassalle replies that it is not
at all the people who made the revolution,
and that the general will
was not even asked to manifest itself.
He recalls the famous pamphlet
of Sieyès, and corrects its title.
It is not true, says he, that the
<i lang="fr">Tiers État</i> was then nothing; the
increase of personal property has,
since then, brought about a <i lang="fr">révolution
économique</i>, thanks to which
the <i lang="fr">tiers état</i> was, in truth, all. But
legally it was nothing, which was
not much to its liking; for the former
ranks of society still existed
by right, although their real strength
was not in keeping with their legal
condition. The work of the French
Revolution was, therefore, to give
to the <i lang="fr">tiers état</i> a legal position
suitable to its actual importance.</p>

<p>Now, the <i lang="fr">tiers</i>, first and foremost,
assumed itself to be the equivalent
of the entire people. “It considered
that its cause was the cause of
humanity.” Thus the attraction
was real and powerful. The voices
raised to protest were unable to
make themselves heard. Our author
cites, on this subject, a curious
instance of clear-sightedness.
An anti-revolutionary journal, <cite>The
Friend of the King</cite>, exclaimed,
“Who shall say whether or not the
despotism of the <i lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i> shall
not succeed the pretended aristocracy
of the nobility?”</p>

<p>It is this, indeed, which has come
to pass, continues Lassalle; the
<i lang="fr">tiers état</i> has become, in its turn, the
privileged class. The proof is that
the wealth of the citizen became
immediately the legal condition of
power in the state.</p>

<p>Since 1791, in the constitution
of Sept. 3 we find (chap. i., sects.
1 and 2) a distinction established
between active citizens and passive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
citizens. The former are those
who pay a certain quota of direct
contribution; and they alone possess
the right of voting. Moreover,
all hired laborers were declared not
active; and this excluded workmen
from the right of voting. It matters
little that the tax was small;
the principle was laid down requiring
some amount of fortune in order
to exercise a political right.
“The wealth of the citizen had become
the condition necessary for
obtaining power in the state, as
nobility or landed property had
been in the Middle Ages.”</p>

<p>The principle of the vote-tax
held sway until the recent introduction
of universal suffrage.</p>

<p>Our socialist, proceeding directly
to the question of taxes, proves
that the <i lang="fr">bourgeoisie moderne</i>, without
inventing indirect taxation, has
nevertheless made it the basis of
an entire system, and has settled
upon it all the expenses of state.
Now, indirect taxes are such as are
levied beforehand upon all necessaries,
as salt, corn, beer, meat, fuel,
or, still more, upon what we need
for our protection&mdash;the expenses
of the administration of justice,
stamped paper, etc. Generally, in
making a purchase, the buyer pays
the tax, without perceiving that it
is that which increases the price.
Now, it is clear that because an
individual is twenty, fifty, or a
hundred times richer, it does not
follow that he will, on that account,
consume twenty, fifty, or a hundred
times more salt, bread, meat, etc.,
than a workman or a person of
humble condition. Thus it happens
that the great body of indirect
taxes is paid by the poorest
classes (from the single fact that
they are the most numerous).
Thus is it brought about, in a hidden
way, that the <i lang="fr">tiers état</i> pay relatively
less taxes than the <i lang="fr">quatrième
état</i>.</p>

<p>Concerning the instruction of
adults, Lassalle says that, instead of
being left to the clergy as heretofore,
it now in fact belongs to the
daily press. But securities, stamps,
and advertisements give to journalism
another privilege of capital.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>This sketch suffices; and I deem
it needless to add that I am far
from concluding with the socialists.
I am so much the more free to disagree
with them as I do not by any
means admit the “immortal principles,”
but it seems to me to follow
evidently from the preceding observations
that it is not true, in
fact, that the general will has made
the laws since 1789.</p>

<h4>VII.&mdash;DOES UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE EXPRESS
THE GENERAL WILL?</h4>

<p>Has the introduction of universal
suffrage modified, in any great degree,
this state of things? Is it
any more certain since 1848, than
before, that the nation is governed
by the general will? We may content
ourselves here by appealing to
the testimony of honest men. If
the general will were truly the master
of all the powers in France, our
country, which to-day, so it is said,
has only the government that it desires,
would be a model of union
and concord; there could be in
the opposition party only an exceedingly
small minority (otherwise
the term general would be unjustifiable),
and we would follow peacefully
the ways most pleasing to us.</p>

<p>This would not be saying&mdash;mark
it well!&mdash;that those ways are good.
That is another question, to which
we will return; but now we are
dealing with the question, Are our
laws to-day formed or not formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
by the general will, according to
the formula which I have quoted
from the <cite>Declaration of the Rights
of Man</cite>?</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the evidence for
the negative, I think it well here to
analyze hastily that which M. Taine
has just given in a little pamphlet
containing many truths.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> M. Taine,
being a free-thinker and a man of
the times, cannot be suspected of
taking an ultramontane or clerical
view of the case.</p>

<p>M. Taine is far from demanding
the abolition of universal suffrage.
He believes it in conformity with
justice; for he does not admit that
his money can be demanded or he
himself sent to the frontier without
his own consent, either expressed
or tacit. His only wish is that the
right of suffrage be not illusory,
and that the electoral law be adapted
“to the French of 1791, to the
peasant, the workman, etc.,” be he
“stupid, ignorant, or ill-informed.”
From this M. Taine proves at the
outset that the ballot-roll is a humbug;
and I believe that no person
of sense will contest the point.
He immediately enters upon a statistical
examination of the composition
of the elective world in
France; and he arrives at the following
result: “Of twenty voters,
ten are peasants, four workmen,
three demi-bourgeois, three educated
men, comfortable or rich.
Now, the electoral law, as all law,
should have regard to the majority,
to the first fourteen.” It behooves
us, then, to know who these fourteen
are who are called to frame the law;
that is to say, to decide, by their
representatives it is true, but sovereignly,
on good and evil, justice
and injustice, and, necessarily, the
fate of the country.</p>

<p>M. Taine, in this connection,
makes some new calculations which
may be thus summed up: The rural
population embraces seventy
out of one hundred of the entire
population, hence fourteen voters
out of twenty. Now, in France,
there are thirty-nine illiterate out
of every hundred males, almost all
belonging to the classes which M.
Taine numbers among the rural
population; which enables him to
find that seven out of every fourteen
rural voters cannot even read.
I may observe, in passing, that a
peasant who cannot read, but who
knows his catechism, may be of a
much sounder morality than M.
Taine himself; but I willingly proclaim
that the seven electors in
question could and should have a
mediocre political intelligence.</p>

<p>This agreeable writer recounts,
in a spicy way, a number of anecdotes
which prove “the ignorance
and credulity” of the rural populations
on similar matters; and he
thence concludes that the peasants
“are still subjects, but under a
nameless master.” This is precisely
what I said at the beginning,
not only of peasants, but of all
modern people in general. Be
there a king on the throne or not,
somebody decrees this, somebody
decrees that; and the subject depends,
in a hundred ways, on this
abstract and undetermined somebody&mdash;“Through
the collector,
through the mayor, through the
sub-inspector of forests, through
the commissary of police, through
the field-keeper, through the clerks
of justice, for making a door, for
felling a tree, building a shed, opening
a stall, transporting a cask of
wine, etc., etc.”</p>

<p>All this expresses well and depicts
admirably the ways of modern
liberty; and I cannot refrain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
from citing this last sketch, equally
amusing and true: “The mayor
knows that in town, in an elegant
apartment, is a worthy gentleman,
attired in broidered gown, who receives
him two or three times a
year, speaks to him with authority
and condescension, and often puts
to him embarrassing questions.
But when this gentleman goes
away, another takes his place quite
similar and in the same garb, and
the mayor, on his return home, says
with satisfaction: ‘Monsieur the
prefect always preserves his good
will towards me, although he has
been changed many times.’”</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr">plébiscite</i>, the appeal to the
people, the invitation to vote on
the form of government, addressed
to this kind of electors&mdash;is it not all
a cunning trick? M. Taine thinks
so, and many others with him; but
he supposes that this same elector
will be, at least, capable of “choosing
the particular man in whom he
has most confidence.” It is with
him, says he, in the choice of one
who shall make the laws, as in the
choice of the physician or the lawyer
whom one may prefer. Although
it is not my intention to
discuss here the opinions of this
author, I beg him to remark that
his comparison is strikingly faulty;
we cannot choose whom we please
for our physician or for our lawyer.
The former is obliged to go through
a course of studies in order to merit
his diploma; the latter must fulfil
the conditions necessary to be admitted
to the bar. To frame the
laws is another thing; not the
slightest preparation is exacted
from those eligible to this duty.
Apparently it is not considered
worth the trouble.</p>

<p>The ballot-roll and <i lang="fr">plébiscite</i> being
disposed of, M. Taine returns
to figures, to study what transpires
when the electors are called upon
to choose a deputy by district.
This gives, says he, one deputy for
twenty thousand voters spread over
a surface of one thousand kilometres
square, etc. Of the twenty
thousand voters, how many will
have a definite opinion of the candidate
presented to them? Scarcely
one in ten beyond the outskirts of
the town; scarcely one in four or
five in the whole district. There
remains the resource of advice; but
“the spirit of equality is all-powerful,
and the hierarchy is wanting.”</p>

<p>We touch here the most sorrowful
wound of our social state; and
this term even, is it not misapplied?&mdash;for
we have no longer any order,
or, by consequence, any social state.
“As a general rule,” continues M.
Taine, “the country people receive
counsel only from their equals.”
Therefore it is easy to employ evil
means. These evil means may be
summed up, according to the same
author, in the abuse of governmental
influence, and in a corruption
whose form varies, but which makes
the affair of an election an affair of
money.</p>

<p>There should be, and I have
alluded to it in passing, many exceptions
made with regard to what
M. Taine says concerning the rural
population. He believes them
manifestly less able to vote than
the city populations, while I am of
quite the contrary opinion; but it
still remains true that direct universal
suffrage, such as we have, does
not allow a person to choose from
a knowledge of the case, and that,
in reality, the general will has not,
up to the present day, been able to
find its true expression.</p>

<p>This is all that I need prove for
the present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<h4>VIII.&mdash;IS THE GENERAL WILL COMPETENT
TO MAKE LAWS?</h4>

<p>This is a still higher question,
and one which we must now approach.
Admitting that the general
will could make itself known, is
it an authority competent to make
laws?</p>

<p>But before starting let us lay
down a first principle which, quite
elementary as it is, seems to be as
much forgotten as the others: if
the natural law exist not anteriorly
to enjoin respect for human laws,
human power would have no other
ground of existence, no other support
than force. Without a divine
lawgiver, there is, in truth, no
moral obligation.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> The hypothesis
of a previous agreement among
the members of society would not
resolve the difficulty; for an agreement
would not be able to bind
any one, at least if there were no
higher authority to secure it.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Whatever may be the immediate
origin of law&mdash;be it promulgated by
a sovereign, enacted by an assembly,
or directly willed by the multitude&mdash;it
would still be unable to rule,
if we do not suppose a law anterior
and, as Cicero says, eternal, which,
in the first place, prescribes obedience
to subjects, and, in the second,
fidelity to reciprocal engagements,
promises, and oaths. This
superior law being the natural law,
it is always, and in every case, impossible
to suppress or to elude it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, what is understood
by the general will? Is it the
unanimity of wills? No one, so
far as I know, has ever exacted this
condition. The question is, then,
taking things at their best, of the
will of the majority. People grant
this, and often give to our modern
governments the name of governments
of the majority. They deduce
then from this principle, that
in a population of thirty millions
of men, for example, it is lawful
that the will of the twenty millions
should rule over that of the remaining
ten millions. If the constitution
of a kingdom, says Burke,
is an arithmetical problem, the calculation
is just; but if the minority
refuse to submit, the majority
will be able to govern only by the
aid of <i lang="fr">la lanterne</i>.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Scaffolds, shootings, exile, prison&mdash;such
are, in truth, the institutions
which have chiefly flourished since
the famous <cite>Declaration of the Rights
of Man</cite>.</p>

<p>In the eyes of a man who knows
how to reason, continues the English
orator, this opinion is ridiculous.</p>

<p>It could not be justified, unless
it were well proved that the majority
of men are enlightened, virtuous,
wise, self-sacrificing, and incapable
of preferring their own interest
to that of others. No one has
ever dared to say that legislators
should make laws for the sake of
making them, and without troubling
themselves concerning the welfare
of those for whom the laws
are made. Now, the laws being
made for all, the majority, if it had
the qualities necessary for legislating,
should concern itself still more
about the minority than about itself.</p>

<p>The Comte de la Marck<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> relates
that when Mirabeau became too
much excited concerning the rights
and privileges of man, it happened
sometimes that he amused himself
by curtailing his accounts. He
cut off first women, children, the
ignorant, the vicious, etc. Once,
the nation being thus reduced to
the little portion whose moral qualities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
it became necessary to estimate,
“I began,” says he, “to deduct
those who lack reason, those
who have false notions, those who
value their own interests above
everything, those who lack education
and knowledge matured by reflection;
and I then asked him if
the men who merit to be spoken
of with dignity and respect would
not find themselves reduced to a
number infinitely small. Now, according
to my principle, I maintained
that the government should
act <em>for</em> the people, and not <em>by</em> them&mdash;that
is to say, not by the opinion
of the multitude; and I proved, by
historical extracts and by examples
which we had unfortunately under
our eyes, that reason and good
sense fly from men in proportion
as they are gathered together in
greater numbers.”</p>

<p>Mirabeau contented himself with
replying that one must flatter the
people in order to govern them,
which amounts to saying that one
must cheat them.</p>

<p>For the rest, this same Mirabeau
acknowledged that equality, in the
revolutionary sense, is absurd, and
the passion which some have for it
he called a violent paroxysm. It is
he who best characterized the true
result of the destruction of all social
order. He called it “vanity’s upsetting.”
He could not have spoken
better; and the vanity which
goes so low could have no other
result than that which we behold&mdash;the
premeditated absence or suppression
of all true superiority.</p>

<p>This episode on equality is not a
digression, for the system of majorities
supposes it. Now, it is absolutely
anti-natural. According to
the beautiful idea of Aristotle:<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
there is in man himself a soul and
a body; the one predominating and
made to command, the other to
obey; the equality or the shifting
of power between these two elements
would be equally fatal to
them. It is the same between man
and the other animals, between
tame animals and wild. The harmony
of sex is analogous, and we
even find some traces of this principle
in inanimate objects; as, for
example, in the harmony of sounds.
Therefore S. Augustine defines order
thus: “Such a disposition of
things similar and dissimilar as
shall give to each what is proper to
it”&mdash;<i lang="la">Ordo est parium dispariumque
rerum sua cuique tribuens dispositio</i>;<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
and S. Thomas hence concludes that
order supposes inequality: <i lang="la">Nomen
ordinis inæqualitatem importat</i>.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>But the “immortal principles”
have changed all that, according to
Sganarelle; so their work, in its
final analysis, results in a disorder
without name.</p>

<p>The external disorder is visible
and pretty generally acknowledged;
but the moral disorder passes unperceived.
By means of equality
on the one hand, and of the secularization
of the law on the other,
they arrive at this frightful result:
for example, that regicide and parricide
are, in justice, but ordinary
crimes; if, moreover, regicide profits
the people, it is worthy of eulogy.
Sacrilege is nothing more
than a superstitious fiction. In
fine, <em>respect</em> being no longer possible
nor even reasonable, according
to the prediction of Burke,<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> “the
laws have no other guardian than
terror, … and in perspective,
from our point of view, we see
but scaffolds,” or courts-martial,
which amount to the same thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<h4>IX.&mdash;CONSEQUENCES OF THE SECULARIZATION
OF LAW.</h4>

<p>How often do we not hear it said
that almost all our misfortunes, and,
above all, our inability to repair
our losses, come from the little respect
we have for the law! This
statement, which has become almost
trite, indicates most frequently a
strange wandering. After having
destroyed respect for persons, is it
not absurd to claim it for their
works? But they have done more:
they have denied the mission of a
legislator. The secularization of
the law&mdash;that is to say, the denial
of a divine sanction applied to law&mdash;has
no other meaning. Legislators
being no longer the mandataries of
God, or not wishing to be such,
now speak only in virtue of their
own lights, and have no real commission.
By what title, then, would
you have us respect them? Every
one is at liberty to prefer his own
lights and to believe that he would
have done better.</p>

<p>I hear the reply: “It is to the
interest of all that order should
reign, were it but materially, and
the law is the principal means of
maintaining order.” You may
hence conclude that it would be
more advantageous to see the laws
obeyed; but a motive of interest is
not a motive of respect, and there
is a certain class of individuals who
may gain by the disorder. No, you
will have the right to claim respect
for the law only when you shall
have rendered the law truly respectable;
and to do this you
must prove that you have the mission
to make the law, even were
you the <i lang="fr">élite</i> of our statesmen and
doctors of the law, and much more
if you are but a collection of the
most uncultivated tax-payers in
the world.</p>

<p>Knowledge is something; it is
something also to represent real
and considerable interests; and I
do not deny the relative importance
of the elements of which legislative
bodies are composed. But nothing
of all this can supply the place of a
commission; and you will have
that only when you shall have consented,
as legislators, to acknowledge
the existence of God, to submit
yourselves to his laws, and to
conform your own thereto.</p>

<p>People have but a very inadequate
idea of the disastrous consequences
which, one day or other,
may ensue from the secularization
of law. Until now the only danger
of which they have dreamed is
that with which extreme revolution
menaces us.</p>

<p>This is a danger so imminent, so
undisguised, that every one sees it;
and some have ended by understanding
that without a return to
God society is destined to fall.
Nay, more, the Assembly now sitting
at Versailles has made an act of
faith by ordering public prayers;
and this first step has caused hope
to revive in the hearts of men of
good-will. But it is not, perhaps,
inopportune to draw the attention
of serious men to another phase of
the question.</p>

<p>What would happen if modern
law should go so far as to enjoin a
crime upon Christians? The hypothesis
is not purely imaginary;
and although, happily, thanks to
Heaven, it has not yet come to pass,
there is a whole party which threatens
to reach this extreme. In other
countries there has been something
like a beginning of its realization.
I would like to speak of the school
law and the avowed project of imposing
a compulsory and lay education.
We know what is meant
by <em>lay</em> in such a case; and experience
proves that the state schools<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
are often entrusted to men whose
avowed intention is to bring up the
children in infidelity. What would
happen if such a law were passed,
which supposes that everywhere, at
the same time, parents would be
compelled to put their children in
imminent danger of losing their
faith? The Catholic Church is
very explicit in her doctrine on the
obligation of obeying even a bad
government; she orders that useless,
unjust, and even culpable laws
be borne with, so long as this can
be done without exposing one’s self
to commit a sin. Neither plunder
nor the danger of death excuses
revolt in her eyes. But in this case
do we understand to what we would
be reduced? To resist passively,
and to allow one’s self to be punished
by fines, by prison, by torture, or
by death, would not remedy the
evil; the soul of the child remains
without defence, and the father is
responsible for it. This kind of
persecution is, then, more serious in
its consequences, and may lead to
deeper troubles, than even the direct
persecution, which might consist,
for example, in exacting apostasy
from adults. In this last case the
martyr bears all, and the first Christians
have shown us the way; but
here the torments of the parents
cannot save the children, and the
parents cannot abandon them;
whatever becomes of the body, the
soul must be guarded until death.</p>

<p>It belongs not to me to decide;
for in this case, as in all those of
a similar kind, the line of conduct
to be followed ought to be traced
by the only competent authority;
but the problem is worth proposing,
and by it alone it is already easy
to throw great light on the abysses
to which the atheism of the law
is leading the people by rapid
strides.</p>

<h4>X.&mdash;CHRISTIAN DEFINITION OF NATURAL
LAW.</h4>

<p>It remains to explain in a few
words the great principles which
should form the basis of law, and
which were never completely ignored
until these days of aberration
and wretchedness. I could not expect
to give here, in these few pages,
a course of natural law, nor even
to trace its outline; but there are
some perfectly incontestable truths
which it is very necessary to recall
since people have forgotten them.
When one has no personal authority,
he feels a certain timidity in
broaching so grave a subject, and
in speaking of it as if he aspired to
enlighten his kind; and meanwhile
error is insinuated, preached, disseminated,
commanded, with a skill
so infernal and a success so great
that ignorance of truth is almost
unbounded. Of such elementary
rules we often find influential persons,
and sometimes persons of
real merit, totally ignorant. In
other days they would have known
them on leaving school, or even
from their catechism.</p>

<p>Let us go back, then, to the definition
of the word nature, and it
will serve as a starting-point from
which to treat of what the laws destined
to govern man should be.</p>

<p>The nature of a being is that
which renders it capable of attaining
its end. This is true of a plant
or an animal as well as of man; but
there are two kinds of ends subordinate
one to the other. The end
for which God created the world
could be no other than God himself.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
The Creator could only propose
to himself an end worthy of
himself, and, he alone being perfect,
he could not find outside himself
an end proportioned to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
greatness. God is, then, the last
end of all creatures. But there are
particular ends; and it is in their
subordination that the order of the
world consists. The primary ends
are, in a certain sense, but a means
for arriving at the last end.</p>

<p>But God being unable to add
anything to his infinite perfection,
the end which he proposed to himself
could not be to render himself
more perfect; hence he could
seek only an exterior glory, which
consists in manifesting himself to
his creatures. For this it was necessary
that some of these creatures
should be capable of knowing him.
These reasonable creatures are superior
to the others and are their
primary end; therefore it is that
theologians call man a microcosm,
a compendium of the universe, and
king of the world.</p>

<p>Man is placed in creation to admire
it, and by means of it to render
homage to God; for, in his
quality of a creature gifted with
reason, he knows his end, which is
God, and the essential characteristic
of his nature is the ability to
attain this end. He is, moreover,
endowed with an admirable prerogative&mdash;liberty,
or free-will; that is
to say, he is called on to will this
end; and God, in his infinite bounty,
will recompense him for having
willed his own good. But man has
need of an effort to will good; for
his primitive nature has been corrupted
by the original fall. He
has, therefore, an inclination to evil,
against which he must incessantly
struggle; and the greatest number
of political and social errors have
their source in ignorance or forgetfulness
of this perversion of human
nature.</p>

<p>This granted, the natural law
comprises the obligations imposed
on man in order that he may reach
his end, together with the prohibition
of all that could turn him away
from it. This law obliges all men,
even those who have no knowledge
of the positive divine law&mdash;that is to
say, the revealed law.</p>

<p>Behold how Gerson has defined
it:</p>

<p>“The natural law is a sign imprinted
upon the heart of every man
enjoying the right use of reason,
and which makes known to him the
divine will, in virtue of which the
human creature is required to do
certain things and to avoid certain
others, in order to reach his end.”
Among the precepts which God
has engraved upon the hearts of all
men is found, in the first rank, that
which obliges them to refer themselves
to God as to their last end.</p>

<p>From this it follows that every
law which tends to hinder or prevent
the progress of men toward
God is a law against nature, and
consequently null (<i lang="la">lex injusta non
est lex</i>); for no human law can
change or abrogate the natural law.</p>

<h4>XI.&mdash;CONTINUATION: THE END OF SOCIETY
ACCORDING TO THE NATURAL
LAW.</h4>

<p>The considerations of the preceding
chapter have reference to
man considered abstractly from society.
But man cannot exist alone.
For life and subsistence, during his
early childhood, he has need of his
kind; so that, from the first moment
of his existence, he forms part
of a domestic society&mdash;the family.</p>

<p>The family being certainly of divine
institution, and the duties which
it imposes being of the number of
those which the natural law commands,
we find therein the first
elements of all society: authority,
hierarchy, consequently inequality,
mutual love, and protection&mdash;in a
word, varied and reciprocal duties.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
But the family suffices not for man’s
social cravings. Man naturally
longs after his like; he possesses
the marvellous gift of speech for
communication with his fellows;
he bears engraven on his heart the
first precept of his duty towards
them: “Do unto others that which
you would have others do unto
you; and do not unto them that
which you would not that they do
to you.” The existence of society
is, therefore, still a law of nature.</p>

<p>Once formed, society itself has
its duties; it has its proper end,
which not only should not be opposed
to the end of man considered
singly, but should moreover contribute
to facilitate the attainment
of that end. The end of man being
God, and this end being attainable
only by virtue, the principal end
of society will necessarily be to
aid men in the practice of virtue;
and, that I may not be accused of
depending exclusively on theology,
I will adduce what Aristotle has
said on this subject: “The most
perfect state is evidently that in
which each citizen, whoever he
may be, may, by favor of the laws,
best practise virtue and be most
secure of happiness.”<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> And what
is happiness, according to Aristotle?
“We consider it a point perfectly
established that happiness is
always in proportion to wisdom; …
[for] the soul, speaking absolutely
and even relatively to us, is more
precious than wealth and the
body.… Following the laws of
nature, all exterior goods are desirable
only insomuch as they serve
the soul, and wise men should
not desire them except for this end;
whereas the soul should never be
placed in comparison with them.”<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>We are assuredly far off from
this pagan, and he goes still further
even than the foregoing; for he
lays down as incontestable a principle
which is the formal condemnation
of the secularization of the
law. “The elements of happiness,”
says he, “are the same for
the individual and for the city.”<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
We have just seen what he understands
by happiness; but he adds,
in order that he may be the better
comprehended, that if the felicity
of the individual consisted in wealth,
it would be the same for the city.
According to Aristotle, therefore,
the moral law obliges society as it
does the individual. Now, it is precisely
this which the partisans of
atheistical or merely secular law
deny.</p>

<h4>XII.&mdash;CHRISTIAN LAW.</h4>

<p>I have designedly quoted the
ancient philosophers, because certain
diseased minds who shrink from
the authority of the sacred books
accept more willingly that of the
learned; but I believe that from
what precedes one could easily infer
the true rule of the relations between
church and state. I will
not undertake it now; nevertheless,
as I address myself, by preference,
to those who profess the same faith
as myself, I will take the liberty to
point out to them some inevitable
corollaries of the principles I have
just recalled.</p>

<p>The natural law, properly so called,
has been confirmed and completed
by revelation. Although
the precepts whose observance is
indispensable to man to reach his
end are engraven in the depths of
his heart, the blindness and the
evil propensities which are the consequences
of his fall render him
but too forgetful of his duties. Besides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
God, having resolved to save
man, chose to himself a privileged
people, that from it he might cause
the Messias to be born; and for
the accomplishment of his merciful
designs he guided this people and
made it the guardian of his law,
even to the day on which the promises
were fulfilled.</p>

<p>To this end God charged Moses
with the promulgation of a positive
divine law which contained moral
precepts&mdash;precepts relating to the
ceremonies of the ancient worship&mdash;and
political precepts; that is to say,
precepts relating to the civil government
of the Jewish people. The
last two classes of precepts no longer
oblige; but those which concern
morals&mdash;that is to say, those
of the Decalogue&mdash;retain all their
force, because they are the precepts
of the natural law.</p>

<p>But it is no longer by virtue of
the promulgation of Moses that we
are bound by the moral obligations
contained in the old law. He who
is our Judge, our Legislator, our
King,<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> has come himself to give us
a more perfect law: “Mandatum
novum do vobis” (Joan. 13). According
to the expression of Suarez,
Jesus Christ has made known more
perfectly the natural law in completing
it by new precepts. Jesus
Christ has done still more: he has
founded a new kingdom&mdash;the church,
the mystical body, of which he is
the head. He has, therefore, appointed
interpreters and guardians
of his law, who have the mission to
proclaim it to those who know it
not; to pardon in his name those
who, having violated it, confess and
repent; and, finally, to distribute
the numberless succors of divine
grace&mdash;all which have for their
object to help us to observe the
law as perfectly as possible, and
consequently to enable us ourselves
to approach perfection. The new
precepts added by Christ to those
of the natural law are those which
enjoin upon us the use of the sacraments
and which determine their
form; these articles of the new law&mdash;if
we may be allowed so to term
them&mdash;are all as obligatory as those
of the natural law, because they
have God himself for their author.
Behold how S. Thomas sums up
the whole of the new law, or the
law of grace, which Christ came to
bring us: “It comprises,” says he,
“the precepts of the natural law,
the articles of faith, and the sacraments
of grace.”</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable characteristics
of the Christian law is
that it was not written. Jesus
Christ <em>spoke</em> his commandments,
and, <em>his word being divine</em>, it engraved
them upon the hearts of his
apostles and disciples;<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> but the
Incarnate Word had nothing written
during the time he spent upon
earth. The first Gospel appeared
at least eight years after the death
of Jesus Christ. If to this observation
we add the common belief
of theologians, according to which
it was only from the coming of the
Holy Ghost&mdash;that is to say, from the
day of Pentecost and after the Ascension&mdash;that
the law of Christ became
obligatory, we arrive at this
conclusion: that the means of oral
teaching was expressly chosen by
the Word for the transmission of
his law and his will.</p>

<p>Nothing throws greater light
upon the sovereign importance of
the church and its hierarchy; nothing
manifests better the extreme
necessity of a permanent infallibility
residing somewhere in the mystical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
body of Christ. The Council
of the Vatican, conformably to the
tradition of all Christian ages, has
<em>defined</em> that “the Roman Pontiff
enjoys the plenitude of that infallibility
with which it was necessary
for the church to be provided in
defining doctrine touching faith or
morals.”</p>

<p>These last words show that the
Pope is the unfailing interpreter of
the natural law, and the judge,
from whom there is no appeal of
its violations.</p>

<p>The decisions given by the Sovereign
Pontiff upon human laws
are not recognized at the present
day by the powers of the earth.
But neither is God recognized; and
thus it is that, little by little violence
has overrun the world and
law has vanished. Europe is returning
to a worse than primitive
barbarism; and Catholics are no
longer alone in saying it.</p>

<p>At the epoch at which the bishops
were gathered together at Rome
for the last council, a publicist of
great merit, an Englishman and a
Protestant, speaking in the name
of his co-religionists, addressed an
appeal to the Pope entreating him
to labor for the re-establishment of
the rights of the people.</p>

<p>The rights of the people, or the
law of nature, said Mr. Urquhart,
is the Ten Commandments applied
to society. After having cited
Lord Mansfield, who says that this
right “is considered to form part
of the English law,” and that “<em>the
acts</em> of the government cannot alter
it,” Mr. Urquhart fears not to
add “that it is against their governments
that nations should protect
this right.” And why did this Protestant
appeal to Rome? Because,
in sight of the unjust wars which
ravage Europe, he hoped that the
Ecumenical Council “would lay
down a rule enabling Catholics to
distinguish the just from the unjust;
so that the Pope might afterwards
exercise juridical power over
communities, nations, and their sovereigns.”<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>The rule exists; for the natural
or divine law engraven by God
from the beginning upon the hearts
of all men, and more expressly revealed
in the Decalogue, was the
subject of the teaching of Christ.
The juridical power and the tribunal
from which there is no appeal
equally exist; but the voice
of the judge is no longer listened
to by those who govern human society.
But it is not this which is
important, and Mr. Urquhart is
right&mdash;it is the nations which should
invoke against their new tyrants
the only efficacious protection; it
is the people who should first bend
before the beneficent authority of
the infallible master of the moral
law; there would then be no further
need of the consent of governments.</p>

<h4>XIII.&mdash;CONCLUSION.</h4>

<p>I said, in beginning the last paragraph,
that it was addressed to
Catholics by right of corollary
from the preceding considerations.
It is certain, indeed, that if all
Catholics were truly instructed and
well convinced of the truths that I
have endeavored to set forth as
briefly and clearly as I could, a
great step in the right path would
already have been taken.</p>

<p>But there is a much-used, widely-spread,
and very convenient objection
which many excellent men fail
not to proffer in such a case. “It
is true,” say they, “that if human
discussions and quarrels could be
referred to the highest moral authority
on earth, it would afford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
great advantages; but this is not
<em>practicable</em>. Times have changed,
and it is impossible to hope that
this authority can ever recover the
influence it would require in order
to act efficaciously.”</p>

<p>If good men adhere to the fatal
habit they have acquired of renouncing
beforehand all effort, for
fear it will not be successful, nothing
can be done; and there remains
to us nothing but to veil our faces
while awaiting the destruction of
our country and of all organized
society. But even were we reduced
to despair, we never have
the right of renouncing our convictions
nor of ceasing to act personally
according to the prescriptions
of our faith. Before concerning
ourselves about the doings of
others, and without needing to
count on success, we must begin by
conforming ourselves to the teachings
of truth, which is by its nature
unchangeable; for there is no progress
or civilization which can alter
one iota of the divine laws.</p>

<p>Moreover, he is very bold who
would dare to predict what Europe
will or will not be several years
hence. Either it is condemned&mdash;and
then, for his own peace of
mind, a man should allow himself
to be guided by his conscience with
the full certainty of not doing
wrong&mdash;or God wills to save Europe
still another time; and this can
never be, save by truth.</p>

<p>With regard to practical means,
of which they make so much at the
present day, I see no one who proposes
them inspiring any confidence.
Every one hesitates,
gropes, and most often acknowledges
that he can only invent.
The present hour is favorable to
good, in this sense: that the greater
number of <em>practical</em> errors no longer
exercise the same seduction as at
the beginning of the century.</p>

<p>Evil presses us on all sides, and,
according to the expression of one
of our most distinguished publicists,
“1789 has failed.”<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> After 1789
there is no middle way between social
war and the return to good.
We meet at every step upright
minds who break their idols; there
are too many who know not yet
with what to replace them, but it
is still much to have seen one’s
error.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there are untiring
seekers, some of whom have found
the whole truth, and others who
find but the fragments; all help to
prepare the way for the reconstruction
of the social edifice. He to
whom I have dedicated this work<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
will pardon me, I hope, if I
quote from him. I do not believe
that there is another example of an
equal influence so rapidly exercised
by a book so serious, so grave in
matter, so little attractive to the
frivolous reader, as that which he
has written upon <cite>Social Reform</cite>.
To rediscover social truth by the
method of observation and analysis
was already a phenomenon which I
consider unique of its kind; to
cause it to be adopted by so great
a number of minds biassed and filled
with hostile prejudices, and
most frequently badly prepared by
their previous studies, is a fact still
more astonishing. Thus, as I said
in my dedicatory epistle, it is impossible
for me not to see herein
one of the most consoling signs of
our age. The scientific processes
of M. Le Play were, perhaps, the
only ones which would find favor
with a generation so dialectical and
so enamored with the exact sciences
as ours.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the sorrows
which oppress us, we must not despair;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
and, above all, we must not
trouble ourselves too much concerning
the errors of what people
agree to call public opinion.</p>

<p>The errors regarding the general
will reproduce themselves, under
another form, in the uneasiness
which this self-styled queen of the
world instils into the minds of men
of good-will. If we consider closely
what the elements of opinion are,
we very quickly perceive that, in
general, it merits the name of public
only because it proclaims itself
very loudly and makes itself known
in all the public squares. In reality,
a party much less considerable than
we suppose announces to the world,
and imagines, most frequently in
good faith, that it alone is enlightened.
Its boldness inspires awe,
and by degrees those who compose
it succeed in persuading the multitude,
and in persuading themselves
that they represent the only <em>opinion</em>
worthy of note. And who are
these? Financiers and journalists
who carry on business in common;
loud-voiced lawyers; professors
much tainted themselves; officers
occupying a position, and others
wishing to obtain one from them;
the idle pleasure-seeking men
and women. Is it, then, true that
these represent the nation?</p>

<p>Eager for their own interest or
for that of others, these pretended
echoes of public opinion are wont
to say “The people believe, the
people wish, the people will never
consent, it does not suit the people,
etc. What a pity! The people
are nothing in revolutions in which
they are but passive instruments.
France no longer ardently desires
anything except repose. At first
sight this proposition would seem
true&mdash;the previous consent of the
French is necessary for the re-establishment
of the monarchy.
Nothing is more false. The multitude
never obtains what it wills;
it always accepts, it never chooses.
We may even notice an <em>affectation</em>
of Providence (if I may be allowed
the expression), inasmuch as the
efforts of the people to attain an
object are the very means which it
makes use of to withdraw them
from it.</p>

<p>“In the French Revolution the
people were constantly chained, outraged,
ruined, torn by factions; and
the factions, in their turn, the sport
of one another, constantly drifted
(notwithstanding all their efforts),
only to be dashed against the rock
which awaited them.… In the
establishment and the overthrow of
sovereignties … the mass of the
people enter only as the wood and
the cord employed by a machinist.
Their chiefs even are such only to
strangers; in reality, they are led as
they lead the people. When the
proper moment shall arrive, the Supreme
Ruler of empires will chase
away these noisy insects. Then we
shall be astonished at the profound
nothingness of these men.</p>

<p>“Do people imagine that the political
world goes on by chance,
and that it is not organized, directed,
animated, by the same wisdom
which shines in the physical world?
Great malefactors who overthrow
the state necessarily produce melancholy,
internal dismemberments
… but when man labors to re-establish
order, he associates himself
with the Author of order, he
is favored by nature&mdash;that is to say,
by the aggregate of secondary
causes which are the instruments
of the Divinity. His action has
something divine; it is at once gentle
and powerful; it forces nothing
and nothing resists it.”<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>These beautiful words are as true
to-day as in 1797.</p>

<h3>DURATION.</h3>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>All change implies succession.
Hence the duration of contingent
beings, inasmuch as they are subject
to actual change, involves succession.
The duration of the
changes brought about by purely
spiritual operations transcends our
experience; for we are not pure
spirits. Hence we have no means
of measuring such changes by their
intrinsic measure. But the duration
of the changes which occur in
the material world through local
movements lies within the range of
our apprehensive faculty, and can
be measured by us; for we find in
nature many movements which, by
their constant recurrence and their
uniformity, are calculated to serve
as terms of comparison for measuring
the length of successive duration.</p>

<p><i>Definitions of time.</i>&mdash;The duration
of local movement, which we measure
by a given standard, is called
“time.” And therefore time may
be properly and adequately defined
as the duration of local movement:
<i lang="la">Duratio motus</i>. From this definition
it immediately follows that
where there is no movement there
can be no time. Accordingly, there
was no time before creation, as
there was no movement. It follows
also that the duration of created
things, inasmuch as it expresses the
permanence of those things in their
own being, is not time; for it is of
the essence of time to be successive,
and there is no succession where
there is no change, and no change
without movement. Hence, when
we say that contingent beings exist
in time, we do not refer to their
essence or substance as such, but
to their successive modes of being,
by which their duration acquires
its accidental successivity. Were
the whole world reduced to perfect
stillness by impeding or suspending
the actions and movements of all
creatures, time would at the same
instant cease to flow; for time is
not the duration of things, but the
duration of movement.</p>

<p>Time may be considered either
as a <em>relation</em> or as a <em>quantity</em>. In
fact, intervals of successive duration
are, like distances, real relations;
but when we think of the
greater or less extent of space which
can be measured with a given velocity
between two correlated terms
of time, these same intervals exhibit
themselves under the form of
continuous quantities.</p>

<p>Time, as a relation, is defined by
S. Thomas and by all the ancients
as <i lang="la">Ratio prioris et posterioris motus</i>&mdash;that
is, as the link between the “before”
and the “after” of any movement;
and, as a quantity, it is defined
as <i lang="la">Numerus motus</i>&mdash;that is, as a
number arising from the mensuration
of the movement. This movement
is always local, as we have
already intimated; for we cannot
measure successive duration by any
other kind of movement. Hence
it is that the duration which is predicated
of spiritual substances and
of their operations differs in kind
from our time. For, since such
substances are not subjected to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
local movements, their duration
cannot be measured in terms of
space and velocity, as our time, but
only in terms of intellectual movements,
which have nothing common
with the periodical revolutions from
which we desume the measure of
our days, years, and centuries.
When we say that angels have existed
for centuries, we measure the
duration of their existence by a
measure which is altogether extrinsic
to them; and in the same manner
we measure the duration of our own
intellectual operations by a measure
extrinsic to them&mdash;that is, by comparing
it with the duration of some
movement occurring in our bodies
or in the surrounding world.</p>

<p>Since time is the duration of
movement, it is plain that when we
perceive movement we immediately
perceive time; and since movement
implies a continuous change,
it is plain also that the greater the
number of changes we can distinctly
perceive in a given succession,
the better we realize the flowing of
time. It is for this reason that
time seems longer in sickness or in
a sleepless night than in good
health and in a pleasurable occupation;
for gladness and amusement
distract our minds, and do not allow
us to reflect enough on what is going
on around us; whilst anything
which affects us painfully calls our
attention to ourselves and to our
sensations, and thus causes us to
reflect on a great number of movements
to which in other circumstances
we would pay no attention
at all. It is for this reason, also,
that when we are fast asleep we
have no perception of the flowing
of time. The moment one falls
asleep he ceases to perceive the
succession of changes, both interior
and exterior, from the consideration
of which time should be estimated;
hence, when he awakes, he
instinctively unites the present <em>now</em>
with that in which he fell asleep, as
if there had been no intermediate
time. Thus, in the same manner as
there is no time without movement,
there is no actual perception of
time without the actual perception
of movement.</p>

<p><i>Measure of time.</i>&mdash;We have said
that time, as a quantity, is measured
by movement. The sense of this
proposition is that a body moving
with uniform velocity describes
spaces proportional to the times
employed; and therefore, if we
assume as a unit of measure the
time employed in describing a certain
unit of space with a given velocity,
the duration of the movement
will contain as many units of
time as there are units of space
measured by that velocity. Thus,
if the revolution of the earth around
its axis is taken as the unit of movement,
and its duration, or the day,
as the unit of time, the number of
days will increase at the same rate
as the number of revolutions.
Speaking in general, if the time
employed in describing uniformly a
space <i>v</i> be taken as a unit of time,
and <i>t</i> be the time employed in describing
uniformly a space <i>s</i> with
the same constant velocity, we have
the proportion&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>s</i>:<i>v</i>::<i>t</i>:1.</p>

<p>The unit of time is necessarily
arbitrary or conventional. For
there is no natural unit of measure
in continuous quantities whose divisibility
has no end, as we have
explained in a preceding article.</p>

<p>The space <i>v</i> uniformly described
in the unit of time represents the
velocity of the movement; and
therefore the duration of the movement
comprises as many units of
time as there are units in the ratio
of the space to the constant velocity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
with which it is measured. In
other terms, time is the ratio of
the space described to the velocity
with which it is described.</p>

<p>We often hear it said that as
time is measured by movement, so
also movement is measured by
time. But this needs explanation.
When we say that time is measured
by movement, we mean that time is
represented by the ratio of the
space to the velocity with which it
is described, or by the ratio of the
material extension to the formal
extending of the movement; for
the proportion above deduced gives</p>

<p class="center"><i>t</i> = <i>s</i>/<i>v</i>,</p>

<p class="noindent">where <i>s</i> represents the length of
the movement in space (which
length is its material constituent)
and <i>v</i> represents its intensity (which
is its formal constituent). On the
other hand, when we say that movement
is measured by time, we either
mean that the ratio of the space to
the velocity is represented by the
time employed in the movement,
and thus we merely interchange
the members of our equation, by
which no new conclusion can be
reached; or we mean that the
length and the velocity of the
movement are measured by time.
But this cannot be; for our equation
gives for the length of the
movement</p>

<p class="center"><i>s</i> = <i>vt</i>;</p>

<p class="noindent">and this shows that time alone cannot
measure the length of the space
described. On the other hand, the
same equation gives for the velocity</p>

<p class="center"><i>v</i> = <i>s</i>/<i>t</i>;</p>

<p class="noindent">and this shows that time is not the
measure of velocity, as the one diminishes
when the other increases.</p>

<p>This suffices to show that the
phrase “movement is measured by
time” must be interpreted in a very
limited sense, as simply meaning
that between movement and time
there is a necessary connection,
and that, all other things remaining
equal, the length of the movement
is proportional to the length of the
time employed. Yet this does not
mean that the length of the movement
depends entirely on the time
employed, for the same length may
be described in different times; but
it means that the time employed
depends on the material and formal
extent of the movement, as above
explained; for, according as we
take different velocities, different
lengths will be described in equal
time, and equal lengths in different
times. It is not the time that extends
the movement, but it is the
movement that by its extension extends
its own time.</p>

<p>The true measure of movement
is its velocity; for the measure of
any given quantity is a unit of the
same kind, and velocity is the unit
of movement. Time, as measured
by us, is a number which arises
from the mensuration of the movement
by its velocity; and therefore
time results from the movement
as already measured. This shows
again that time is not the measure
of the <em>extent</em> of the movement.
We have seen, also, that time is not
the measure of the <em>intensity</em> of the
movement. It follows, therefore,
that the quantity of movement is
not measured by time.</p>

<p>Time, being the ratio of two
quantities mathematically homogeneous,
is represented by an <em>abstract</em>
number. Yet the same time may
be expressed by different numbers,
according as we measure it by different
units, as days, hours, minutes,
etc. These numbers, however,
are only virtually discrete, as
time cannot be discontinued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>Balmes from the equation</p>

<p class="center"><i>v</i> = <i>s</i>/<i>t</i></p>

<p class="noindent">deduces the consequence that “the
velocity is essentially a relation;
for it cannot be otherwise expressed
than by the ratio of the space
to the time.”<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> We think that this
conclusion is faulty. Space and
time are not homogeneous quantities;
hence the mathematical ratio
of space to time is not an abstract
but a concrete number, and therefore
it represents an absolute quantity.
Space divided by time is a
length divided into equal parts;
hence the quotient&mdash;viz., the velocity&mdash;represents
the length of the
movement made in the unit of
time. And since Balmes admits
that the length of the movement is
a quantity having a determinate
value, we do not see how he can
escape the consequence that velocity,
too, is a quantity of the
same kind, and not a mere relation.
“In the expression of velocity,”
says Balmes, “two terms
enter&mdash;space and time. Viewing
the former in the real order, abstraction
made of that of phenomena,
we more easily come to regard
it as something fixed; and we comprehend
it in a given case without
any relation. A foot is at all times
a foot, and a yard a yard. These
are quantities existing in reality,
and if we refer them to other quantities
it is only to make sure that
they are so, not because their reality
depends upon the relation.
A cubic foot of water is not a cubic
foot because the measure so
says, but, on the contrary, the measure
so says because there is a cubic
foot. The measure itself is also
an absolute quantity; and in general
all extensions are absolute, for
otherwise we should be obliged to
seek measure of measure, and so
on to infinity” (loc. cit.) This
passage shows that a length described
in space is, according to
Balmes, an absolute quantity. And
since the mathematical value of
velocity represents a length described
in space, as we have just
proved, it follows that velocity has
an absolute value.</p>

<p>But leaving aside all mathematical
considerations, we may show
that velocity has an absolute value
by reference to metaphysical data.
What is velocity but the development
in extension of the intensity
of the momentum impressed on a
material point? Now, the intensity
of the momentum is an absolute
quantity, equal to the quantity of
the action by which it is produced.
Hence it is evident that, as the
action has an absolute value, greater
or less, according to circumstances,
so also the momentum impressed
has an absolute value; and consequently
the velocity also, which
is nothing else than the momentum
itself as developing its intensity
into extension, has an absolute value,
and is an absolute quantity.</p>

<p>Balmes thought the contrary, for
the following reason: “If the denominator,
in the expression of velocity,
were a quantity of the same
kind as space&mdash;that is, having determinate
values, existing and conceivable
by themselves alone&mdash;the
velocity, although still a relation
might also have determinate values,
not indeed wholly absolute, but
only in the supposition that the
two terms <i>s</i> and <i>t</i>, having fixed values,
are compared.… But from the
difficulties which we have, on the one
hand, seen presented to the consideration
of time as an absolute thing,
and from the fact that, on the other
hand, no solid proof can be adduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
to show such a property to have
any foundation, it follows that we
know not how to consider velocity
as absolute, even in the sense above
explained” (loc. cit.)</p>

<p>This reason proves the contrary
of what the author intends to establish.
In fact, if the denominator
were of the same kind as the
numerator, the quotient would be
an abstract number, as we know
from mathematics; and such a
number would exhibit nothing more
than the relation of the two homogeneous
terms&mdash;that is, how many
times the one is contained in the
other. It is precisely because the
denominator is not of the same
kind as the numerator that the
quotient must be of the same kind
as the numerator. And since the
numerator represents space, which,
according to Balmes, is an absolute
quantity, it follows that the quotient&mdash;that
is, the number by which
we express the velocity&mdash;exhibits a
quantity of the same nature: a conclusion
in which all mathematicians
agree. When a man walks a mile,
with the velocity of one yard per
second, he measures the whole mile
yard by yard, with his velocity.
If the velocity were not a quantity
of the same kind with the space
measured, how could it measure
it?</p>

<p>True it is that velocity, when
considered in its metaphysical aspect,
is not a length of space, but
the intensity of the act by which
matter is carried through such a
length. Yet, since Balmes argues
here from a mathematical equation,
we must surmise or presume that
he considers velocity as a length
measured in space in the unit of
time, as mathematicians consider
it; for he cannot argue from mathematical
expressions with logical consistency,
if he puts upon them construction
of an unmathematical character.
After all, it remains true that
the velocity or intensity of the movement
is always to be measured by
the extension of the movement in
the unit of time; and thus it is necessary
to admit that velocity exhibits
an absolute intensive quantity
measured by the extension
which it evolves.</p>

<p>We therefore “know how to consider
velocity as absolute,” though
its mathematical expression is drawn
from a relation of space to time.
The measure of any quantity is
always found by comparing the
quantity with some unit of measure;
hence all quantity, inasmuch
as measured, exhibits itself under
a relative form as <i lang="la">ratio mensurati
ad suam mensuram</i>; and it is only
under such a form that it can be
expressed in numbers. But this
relativity does not constitute the
nature of quantity, because it presupposes
it, and has the whole reason
of its being in the process of
mensuration.</p>

<p>We have insisted on this point
because the confusion of the absolute
value of velocity with its relative
mathematical expression would
lead us into a labyrinth of difficulties
with regard to time. Balmes,
having overlooked the distinction
between the mathematical expression
and the metaphysical character
of velocity, comes to the striking
consequence that “if the whole
machine of the universe, not excluding
the operations of our soul,
were accelerated or retarded, an
impossibility would be realized;
for the relation of the terms would
have to be changed without undergoing
any change. If the velocity
be only the relation of space to
time, and time only the relation of
spaces traversed, it is the same
thing to change them all in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
same proportion, and not to change
them at all. It is to leave every
thing as it is” (loc. cit.) The
author is quite mistaken. The
very equation</p>

<p class="center"><i>t</i> = <i>s</i>/<i>v</i>,</p>

<p class="noindent">on which he grounds his argument,
suffices to show that if the velocity
increases, the time employed in
measuring the space <i>s</i> diminishes;
and if the velocity diminishes, the
time increases. This being the
case, it is evident that an acceleration
of the movements in the whole
machine of the universe would be
a <em>real</em> acceleration, since the same
movements would be performed in
less time; and a retardation would
be a <em>real</em> retardation, since the same
movements would require more
time. We are therefore far from
realizing an impossibility when we
admit that, in the hypothesis of the
author, time would vary in the inverse
ratio of the velocity of the
universal movement.</p>

<p><i>Division of time.</i>&mdash;Philosophers
divide time into <em>real</em> and <em>imaginary</em>.
We have already explained this
division when speaking of flowing
duration. The reality of time evidently
depends on the reality of
movement; hence any time to
which no real movement corresponds
is imaginary. Thus if you
dream that you are running, the
time of your running is imaginary,
because your running, too, is imaginary.
In such a case the real time
corresponds to your real movements&mdash;say,
to your breathing,
pulse, etc.&mdash;while the dream continues.</p>

<p>Imaginary time is often called
also <em>ideal</em> time, but this last epithet
is not correct; for, as time is the
duration of local movement, it is in
the nature of time to be an object
of the imagination. And for this
reason the duration of the intellectual
movements and operations of
pure spirits is called time only by
analogy, as we have above stated.
However, we are wont to think of
such a duration as if it were homogeneous
with our own time; for we
cannot measure it except by reference
to the duration of the movements
we witness in the material
world.</p>

<p>Time is also divided into <em>past</em>,
<em>present</em>, and <em>future</em>. The past corresponds
to a movement already
made, the future to a movement
which will be made, and the present
to a movement which is actually
going on. But some will ask: Is
there really any present time?
Does not the <em>now</em>, to which the
present is confined, exclude all
<em>before</em> and all <em>after</em>, and therefore
all succession, without which it is
impossible to conceive time? We
concede that the <em>now</em>, as such&mdash;that
is, considered in its absolute reality&mdash;is
not time, just as a point is not a
line; for, as the point has no length,
so the <em>now</em> has no extension. Yet,
as a point in motion describes a
line, so also the <em>now</em>, by its flowing
from <em>before</em> to <em>after</em>, extends time.
Hence, although the <em>now</em>, as such, is
not time, its flowing from <em>before</em> to
<em>after</em> is time. If, then, we consider
the present as the link of the immediate
past with the immediate future&mdash;that
is, if we consider the <em>now</em>
not statically, but dynamically&mdash;we
shall see at once that its actual
flowing from <em>before</em> to <em>after</em> implies
succession, and constitutes an infinitesimal
interval of time.</p>

<p>This may also be shown by reference
to the nature of uniform local
movement. When a material point
describes a line with uniform velocity,
its movement being continuous,
its duration is continuous; and
therefore every flowing instant of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
its duration is continuous, as no
discontinuous parts can ever be
reached in the division of continuum.
Hence every flowing instant
has still the nature of time. This
conclusion is mathematically evident
from the equation</p>

<p class="center"><i>t</i> = <i>s</i>/<i>v</i>,</p>

<p class="noindent">for, <i>v</i> being supposed constant, we
cannot assume <i>t</i> = 0 unless we
also assume <i>s</i> = 0. But this latter
assumption would imply rest instead
of movement, and therefore
it is out of the question. Accordingly,
at no instant of the movement
can we assume <i>t</i> = 0; or, which
is the same, every flowing instant
partakes the nature of time.</p>

<p>The same conclusion can be
established, even more evidently,
by the consideration of accelerated
or retarded movements. When a
stone is thrown upwards, the velocity
of its ascent suffers a <em>continuous</em>
diminution till at last it becomes
= 0; and at the very instant it becomes
= 0 an opposite velocity begins
to urge the stone down, and
increases continually so long as the
stone does not reach the ground or
any other obstacle. Now, a continuous
increase or decrease of the
velocity means that there are not
two consecutive moments of time
in which the stone moves at exactly
the same rate; and hence nothing
but an instant corresponds to each
successive degree of velocity. But
since the duration of the movement
is made up of nothing but such instants,
it is clear that the succession
of such instants constitutes time;
and consequently, as time is continuous,
those instants, though infinitesimal,
are themselves continuous;
and thus every flowing instant
is really time.</p>

<p>From this it is plain, first, that
although the <em>now</em>, as such, is not
time, yet its actual flowing is time.</p>

<p>Secondly, it follows that infinitesimals
of time, as employed in dynamics,
are not mathematical figments,
but realities, for time flows
only through infinitesimal instants;
and therefore to deny the reality of
such infinitesimals would be to
deny the reality of time.</p>

<p>Thirdly, we gather that the absolute
<em>now</em> differs from an actual infinitesimal
of time; because the former,
as such, is only a term of time,
whereas the latter is the flowing of
that term from its immediate <em>before</em>
to its immediate <em>after</em>. Hence an
infinitesimal of time is infinitely
less than any designable duration.
In fact, its <em>before</em> and its <em>after</em> are
so immediately connected with the
same absolute <em>now</em> that there is no
room for any designable length of
duration between them.</p>

<p>Fourthly, whilst the absolute <em>now</em>
is no quantity, the infinitesimal of
time is a real quantity; for it implies
real succession. This quantity,
however, is nascent, or <i lang="la">in fieri</i>
only; for the <em>now</em>, which alone is
intercepted between the immediate
<em>before</em> and the immediate <em>after</em>, has
no formal extension.</p>

<p>Fifthly, the infinitesimal of time
corresponds to a movement by
which an infinitesimal of space is
described. And thus infinitesimals
of space, as considered in dynamics,
are real quantities. To deny that
such infinitesimals are real quantities
would be the same, in fact, as
to deny the real extension of local
movement; for this movement
flows and acquires its extension
through such infinitesimals only.
And the same is true of the infinitesimal
actions by which the rate of
local movement is continually modified.
These latter infinitesimals
are evidently real quantities, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
infinitely less than any designable
quantity. They have an infinitesimal
intensity, and they cause an infinitesimal
change in the rate of the
movement in an infinitesimal of
time.</p>

<p><i>Evolution of time.</i>&mdash;The preceding
considerations lead us to understand
how it is that in any interval of time
there is but one absolute <em>now</em> always
the same <i lang="la">secundum rem</i>, but
changing, and therefore manifold
<i lang="la">secundum rationem</i>. S. Thomas, in
his opuscule <cite>De Instantibus</cite>, c. ii., explains
this truth in the following
words: “As a point to the line, so
is the <em>now</em> to the time. If we imagine
a point at rest, we shall not
be able to find in it the causality of
any line; but if we imagine that
point to be in movement, then, although
it has no dimensions, and
consequently no divisibility in itself,
it will nevertheless, from the
nature of its movement, mark out a
divisible line.… The point, however,
does in no way belong to the
essence of the line; for one and the
same real term, absolutely indivisible,
cannot be at the same time in
different parts of the same permanent
continuum.… Hence the
mathematical point which by its
movement draws a line is neither
the line nor any part of the line;
but, remaining one and the same in
itself, it acquires different modes
of being. These different modes
of being, which must be traced to
its movement, are really in the line,
whilst the point, as such, has no
place in it. In the same manner,
an instant, which is the measure of
a thing movable, and adheres to it
permanently, is one and the same
as to its absolute reality so long as
the substance of the thing remains
unimpaired, for the instant is the
inseparable measure of its being;
but the same instant becomes manifold
inasmuch as it is diversified by
its modes of being; and it is this
its diversity that constitutes the
essence of time.”<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>From this explanation we may
infer that, as each point, or primitive
element, of matter has its own
<em>now</em>, one in its absolute reality, but
manifold in its mode of being,
there are in nature as many <em>nows</em>
describing distinct lines of time as
there are material points in movement.
Accordingly, there are as
many particular times as there are
elements moving in space. The
proposition that in time there is
only <i lang="la">unum instans in re</i> is, therefore,
to be limited to the particular time
of one and the same subject of
motion. S. Thomas did not think
of this limitation, because he believed,
according to the old astronomical
theory, that the movement
of the <i lang="la">primum mobile</i>&mdash;that is, of the
supreme sphere&mdash;was the natural
measure of time; and for this reason
he thought that, as the first
movement was one, time also was
one, and constituted the common
measure of all simultaneous movements.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
But the truth is that there
must be as many distinct particular
times as there are things actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
moving. This is a manifest consequence
of the doctrine which assimilates
a flowing <em>now</em> to a point
describing a line. For as every
point in movement describes a distinct
line in space, so also must the
absolute <em>now</em> of every distinct being
describe by its flowing a distinct
line of time.</p>

<p>The general time, which we regard
as <em>one</em> successive duration, is
the duration of the movement from
the beginning of the world to our
day, conceived in the abstract&mdash;that
is, without reference to the particular
beings concerned in the movement.
Time, when thus conceived,
is a mere abstraction; whereas the
particular times of particular movements
are concrete in their continuous
extension, notwithstanding
their being represented by abstract
numbers. If we knew of any special
body created and put in movement
before any other body, we
might regard it as <i lang="la">primum mobile</i>,
and take its movement, if uniform,
as the natural measure or standard
of general time; but as we know
of no such particular body, and as
we have reason to believe that the
creation of all matter was made in
one and the same moment, we are
led to admit an exceedingly great
multitude of <i lang="la">prima mobilia</i>, every
one of which was from the beginning
of time the subject of duration.
It is clear that we cannot
reduce their distinct durations to
one general duration, except by
making abstraction of all particular
subjects, and considering movement
in the abstract.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as we inhabit the
earth, we usually restrict our consideration
of time to those periodical
intervals of duration which
correspond to the periodical movements
we witness in, or from, our
planet; and thus we take the duration
of the diurnal or of the orbital
movement of the earth as our
standard for the measure of time.
If other planets are inhabited by
rational beings, it is obvious that
their time will be measured by
other standards, as their diurnal
and orbital movements differ from
those of our earth.</p>

<p>To the doctrine that time is
evolved by the flowing of a single
instant, S. Thomas adds an important
remark to the effect that the
<em>now</em> of contingent things should
not be confounded with the <em>now</em> of
eternity. He proposes to himself
the following objection: “To stand
and to move are not essential differences,
but only different manners
of being. But the <em>now</em> of eternity
is standing, and the <em>now</em> of time is
moving. The one, therefore, seems
to differ from the other in nothing
but in the manner of being.
Hence the <em>now</em> of time would be
substantially the same as the <em>now</em>
of eternity, which is absurd.”<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>S. Thomas replies: “This cannot
be true, according to our doctrine;
for we have seen that eternity
and time differ essentially.
Moreover, when of two things the
one depends on the other as an effect
from a cause, the two things
essentially differ; but the <em>now</em> of
eternity (which does not really differ
from eternity itself) is the cause
of time and of the <em>now</em> of time;
therefore the <em>now</em> of time and the
<em>now</em> of eternity are essentially different.
Furthermore, the <em>now</em> of
time unites the past with the future,
which the <em>now</em> of eternity does not
do; for in eternity there is no past
and no future, because eternity is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
all together. Nor has the objection
any force. That to stand and
to move do not constitute an essential
difference is true of those
things which are liable both to
stand and to move; but that which
always stands without possibility
of moving differs essentially from
that which always moves without
the possibility of standing. And
this is the case with the <em>now</em> of
eternity on the one hand, and the
<em>now</em> of time on the other.”<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p><i>Beginning of time.</i>&mdash;Here the
question arises whether time must
have had a beginning. Those who
believe that the world could have
been created <i lang="la">ab æterno</i> will answer
that time could have existed without
a beginning. But we are convinced
that the world could not be
created <i lang="la">ab æterno</i>; and therefore
we maintain that time must have
begun.</p>

<p>Our argument is drawn from the
contingency of all things created.</p>

<p>The duration of a contingent being
cannot be without a beginning;
for the contingent being itself must
have had a beginning. In fact, as
that cannot be annihilated which
has never been in existence, so that
cannot be educed from nothing
which has never been nothing. It
is therefore necessary to admit that
every creature had a beginning of
its existence, and consequently of
its duration also; for nothing endures
but inasmuch as it exists.</p>

<p>Nor can this argument be evaded
by saying that a contingent being
may have <i lang="la">initium naturæ</i>, without
having <i lang="la">initium temporis</i>. This distinction,
though suggested and employed
by S. Thomas, has no
foundation, because the beginning
of the created nature is the beginning
also of its duration; and he
who concedes that there must be
an <i lang="la">initium naturæ</i> cannot consistently
deny the <i lang="la">initium temporis</i>.
In fact, no contingent being can be
said to have been created, if there
was no instant in which it was
created; in other terms, every
creature must be traced to the <em>now</em>
of its creation. But the <em>now</em> of its
creation is the beginning of its duration
no less than of its existence.
Surely, whatever has a first <em>now</em>
has a beginning of duration; but
every creature has its first <em>now</em>&mdash;viz.,
the <em>now</em> of its creation; therefore
every creature has a beginning of
duration. That the <em>now</em> of creation
is the first <em>now</em> is self-evident; for
the <em>now</em> of creation is that point of
duration in which the passage is
made from not being to being; and
therefore it marks the beginning of
the existence of the created being.
And since we cannot say that the
duration of the created being preceded
its existence, we are bound
to conclude that the <em>now</em> of its creation
is the beginning of its duration
as well as of its existence.</p>

<p>Some will object that we assume
what is to be proved&mdash;viz., the very
<em>now</em> of creation. For, if the world
had been created <i lang="la">ab æterno</i>, no <em>now</em>
of creation could be pointed out.
To this we answer that the <em>now</em>
of creation, whether we can point
it out determinately or not, must
always be admitted. To suppress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
it, is to suppress creation. For,
if we assume that a thing had no
<em>now</em> of creation, we are compelled
to deny that such a thing has ever
been created. In other terms, if
anything has no beginning of duration,
it was always in act, it never
lacked actual existence, and it
never passed from non-existence to
actual existence&mdash;that is, it is no
creature at all; for to be a creature
is to have passed from non-existence
to actual existence. And
thus we must conclude that to create
is to make a beginning of time.</p>

<p>The impossibility of a world
created <i lang="la">ab æterno</i> has also been
argued from the impossibility of an
infinite ascending series. The force
of this proof does not, however, lie
in the absurdity of an infinite
series&mdash;for such an absurdity, as S.
Thomas remarks, has never been
demonstrated&mdash;but it lies in the
necessity of granting a beginning to
every term of the series itself; for,
if every term of the series has a beginning,
the whole series must have
a beginning. S. Thomas, as we
have just stated, teaches that an infinite
ascending series is not to be
judged impossible, “even if it were
a series of efficient causes,” provided
it depend on an extrinsic cause:
<i lang="la">In infinitum procedere in causis agentibus
non reputatur impossibile.</i><a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
This doctrine is universally rejected,
and was fiercely attacked even
in the time of the holy doctor; but
he persisted in maintaining it
against all, and wrote a special
treatise to defend it <i lang="la">contra murmurantes</i>.
The reason why S. Thomas
embraced this doctrine seems to
have been that the creation of the
world in the beginning of time was
an article of faith; and the saint
believed that articles of faith are
proved only by authority, and not
by natural reason. He was therefore
obliged to maintain that the
beginning of time could not be demonstrated
by reason alone. “The
newness of the world,” says he,
“cannot be demonstrated from the
consideration of the world itself,
because the principle of demonstration
is the quiddity of things. Now,
things, when considered as to their
quiddity or species, do not involve
the <i lang="la">hic et nunc</i>; and for this reason the
universals are said to be everywhere
and in all time. Hence it cannot
be demonstrated that man or any
other thing did not always exist.”<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>To this argument we respectfully
reply that, when the necessary conditions
of a contingent fact are to
be demonstrated, the principle of
demonstration is not the abstract
quiddity, or intelligible essence, of
the things, but the contingency of
their actual existence. But it is
evident that whatever exists contingently
has been educed out of nothing.
It is therefore necessary to
conclude that all contingent things
have had a first moment of existence
and of duration.</p>

<p>The Angelic Doctor refers also to
a similitude by which some philosophers
mentioned by S. Augustine
undertook to explain the creation
<i lang="la">ab æterno</i>. If a foot had been
<i lang="la">ab æterno</i> pressed on the dust, the
impression made by it would be <i lang="la">ab
æterno</i>. In the same manner the
world might have been <i lang="la">ab æterno</i>:
for God, its maker, is eternal.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
we humbly reply that the impression
of the foot on the dust cannot
be <i lang="la">ab æterno</i> if it is contingent.
For, if it is contingent, it has necessarily
a beginning of its existence,
and therefore of its duration also,
as we have already shown. Whatever
is made has a beginning of
duration. Hence the fathers of
the church, to prove that the divine
Word was not made, thought it
sufficient to point out the fact that
he was <i lang="la">ab æterno</i> like his Father.</p>

<p>S. Thomas, after stating his conclusion
that the temporal beginning
of the world is not demonstrable,
but simply credible, remarks as follows:
“And this should be kept in
mind, lest, by presuming to demonstrate
what is matter of faith by insufficient
proofs, we be laughed at
by the infidels, who may think that
on the strength of such proofs we
believe our articles of faith.”<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
This advice is good. But we need
not tell our readers that what we
hold as of faith we hold on divine
authority, irrespective of our philosophical
reasons.</p>

<p><i>Perpetuity of time.</i>&mdash;That time
may go on without end is an evident
truth. But will it go on for
ever, or will it cease at last? To
this question we answer that time
will for ever continue. As long as
there will be movement there will
be time. There will ever be movement;
therefore there will ever be
time. The major of this syllogism
needs no explanation; for time is
nothing but the duration of movement.
The minor is quite certain.
For not only the rational creatures,
but the earth itself and other corporeal
things, will last for ever, as is
the common doctrine of philosophers,
who hold that God will never
destroy what he has created. These
material things will therefore continue
to celebrate God’s glory for
ever&mdash;that is, will continue to exert
their motive power and to bring
about divers movements; for such
is their nature, and such their manner
of chanting the praises of their
Creator. Moreover, we know by
faith that we shall rise from death
and live for ever, and that the glorious
bodies of the saints will possess,
besides other privileges, the
gift of agility, which would evidently
be of no use if there were to be
no local movement and no succession
of time. Hence it follows that
time will last for ever.</p>

<p>And let no one say that the Sacred
Scriptures teach the contrary.
For wherever the Sacred Scriptures
mention <em>the end of time</em>, they speak,
not absolutely and universally, but
only with reference to certain particular
periods or epochs of time
characterized by some special
events or manifestation of divine
Providence. Thus we read in the
Apocalypse that “there will be
time no more”&mdash;<i lang="la">Tempus non erit amplius</i>&mdash;and
yet we find that after
the end of that time there will be a
thousand years; which shows that
the phrase “there will be time no
more” refers to the time of mercy
and conversion. Thus also we
read in Daniel that “time has its
end”&mdash;<i lang="la">Quoniam habet tempus finem
suum</i>&mdash;but we see by the context
that he speaks there of the Antichristian
epoch, which of course
must have an end. And the like is
to be said of other similar passages.</p>

<p>The most we can admit in regard
to the cessation of time is that, owing
to the great catastrophe and
the wonderful changes which the
consummation of the present epoch
shall bring about, the diurnal and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
the annual revolutions, which serve
now as measures of time, may be so
modified as to give rise to a new
order of things, in which time shall
be measured by a different standard.
This seems to be the opinion of many
interpreters of the Sacred Scriptures;
though some of them speak as if after
the consummation of the present
things there were to be time no more,
but only eternity. This manner of
speaking, however, is no proof
against the continuance of time; for
the word “eternity,” when applied
to the duration of creatures, means
nothing else than sempiternity&mdash;that
is, time without end, according to
the scriptural phrase: <i lang="la">Annos æternos
in mente habui</i>. We learn from
S. Thomas that the word “eternity”
is used in three different senses:
First, we call eternity the measure
of the duration of a thing which is
always invariably the same, which
acquires nothing from the future,
and loses nothing from the past.
And this is the most proper meaning
of the word “eternity.” Secondly,
we call eternity the measure
of the duration of a thing which
has a fixed and perpetual being,
which, however, is subject to accidental
changes in its operations.
Eternity, when thus interpreted,
means what we should call <i lang="la">ævum</i>
properly; for the <i lang="la">ævum</i> is the measure
of those things whose being
lasts for ever, but which admit of
succession in their operations, as
is the case with pure intelligences.
Thirdly, we call eternity the measure
of a successive duration,
which has <em>before</em> and <em>after</em> without
beginning and without end, or simply
without end, though it have a
beginning; and in this sense the
world has been said to be eternal,
although it is really temporal.
This is the most improper meaning
of the word “eternity”; for the
true concept of eternity excludes
<em>before</em> and <em>after</em>.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Thus far S. Thomas.</p>

<p>We may be allowed to remark on
this passage that, according to the
principles which we have established
in our articles on <cite>Substantial
Generations</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> not only the pure intelligences,
but all primitive and elementary
substances are substantially
incorruptible, and have a fixed
and permanent being. Hence
the distinction made by the holy
doctor between <i lang="la">ævum</i> and endless
time ceases to have a foundation,
and the whole difference between
the endless duration of spiritual
and of material changes will be reduced
to this: that the movements
of spiritual substances are intellectual,
whereas those of the material
elements are local.</p>

<p><i>The phrase “before creation.”</i>&mdash;We
often hear of such expressions
as these: “Before creation there
was God alone,” “Before creation
there was no time,” etc.; and since
such expressions seem to involve a
contradiction in terms, we think it
will not be superfluous to give their
rational explanation. Of course, if
the words “before creation” be
understood absolutely&mdash;that is, excluding
any creation either made
or imagined&mdash;those words will be
contradictory. For the preposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
<em>before</em> is relative, and implies succession;
and it is contradictory to
suppose succession without anything
capable of succession. When
no creature existed there could be
nothing flowing from <em>before</em> to <em>after</em>,
because there was no movement,
there being nothing movable.</p>

<p>Nor can it be said that the <em>now</em>
of divine eternity gives us a sufficient
ground for imagining any <em>before</em>
and <em>after</em> without referring to
something exterior to God himself.
The <em>now</em> of eternity has in itself
neither <em>before</em> nor <em>after</em>; and when
we say that it is equivalent to all
imaginable time, we do not affirm
that it implies succession, but only
acknowledge that it is the supreme
reason of the possibility of succession
in created things. Hence,
when we use the phrase “Before
creation” in an absolute sense, we
in fact take away all real <em>before</em>
and all real <em>after</em>; and thus the
words “Before creation,” taken
absolutely, involve a contradiction.
They affirm explicitly what they implicitly
deny.</p>

<p>The truth is that, when we use
the phrase in question, we express
what is in our imagination, and
not in our intellect. We imagine
that before time there was eternity
because we cannot picture to ourselves
eternity, except by the phantasm
of infinite time. It is for this
reason that in speaking of eternity
we use the terms by which we are
accustomed to express the relations
of time. The words “Before creation”
are therefore to be understood
of a time which was possible
in connection with some possible
anterior creation, but which has
never existed. This amounts to
saying that the <em>before</em> which we conceive
has no existence except in
our imagination.</p>

<p>S. Thomas proposes to himself
the question whether, when we say
that God was before the world, the
term “before” is to be interpreted
of a priority of nature or of
a priority of duration. It might
seem, says he, that neither interpretation
is admissible. For if God
is before the world only by priority
of nature, then it follows that, since
God is <i lang="la">ab æterno</i>, the world too is
<i lang="la">ab æterno</i>. If, on the contrary, God
is before the world by priority of
duration, then, since priority and
posteriority of duration constitute
time, it follows that there was time
before the creation of the world;
which is impossible.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>In answer to this difficulty the
holy doctor says that God is before
the world by priority of duration,
but that the preposition “before”
designates here the priority,
not of time, but of eternity. Or
else we must answer, he adds, that
the word “before” designates a
priority, not of real, but of imaginary,
time, just as the word “above”
in the phrase “above the heavens
there is nothing” designates an imaginary
space which we may conceive
by thinking of some imaginary
dimensions superadded to the
dimensions of the heavens.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>It strikes us that the first of
these two answers does not really
solve the difficulty. For the priority
of eternity cannot mean but a
priority of nature and of pre-eminence,
by which God’s permanent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
duration infinitely <em>excels</em>, rather
than <em>precedes</em>, all duration of creatures.
In accordance with this,
the objector might still urge on his
conclusion that, if God does not
precede the world, the world is <i lang="la">ab
æterno</i> like God himself. The second
answer agrees with what we
ourselves have hitherto said. But
as regards the objection proposed,
it leaves the difficulty entire. For,
if God was before the world by a
priority, not of real, but of imaginary
time, that “before” is imaginary,
and not real. And the consequence
will be that God was not
really “before” the world, but we
imagine him to have been so.</p>

<p>We must own that with our imperfect
language, mostly fashioned
by imagination, it is not easy to
give a clear and popular solution
of the objection. Perhaps the
most summary manner of dealing
with it would be to deny the inference
in the first horn of the dilemma&mdash;viz.,
that if God is before the
world by priority of nature only,
then the world will be <i lang="la">ab æterno</i> as
much as God himself. This inference,
we say, is to be denied; for
it involves the false supposition
that a thing is <i lang="la">ab æterno</i> if there is
no time before it; whereas that
only is <i lang="la">ab æterno</i> which has no beginning
of duration.</p>

<p>Thus there is no need of saying
that God <em>precedes</em> the world in duration;
for it suffices to admit that
he was before the world by priority
of nature and of causality. The
duration of eternity has no “before”
and no “after,” though we
depict it to ourselves as extending
into indefinite time. Even the
verb <em>was</em> should not be predicated
of God; for God, strictly speaking,
neither was, nor will be, but permanently
<em>is</em>. Hence it seems to us
that it would be a contradiction to
affirm that God was <em>before</em> the
world by the duration of his eternity,
while we acknowledge that in
his eternity there is no “before.”
But enough about this question.</p>

<p><i>The duration of rest.</i>&mdash;Supposing
that a body, or an element of matter,
is perfectly at rest, it may be
asked how the duration of this rest
can be ascertained and measured.
Shall we answer that it is measured
by time? But if so, our reader
will immediately conclude that time
is not merely the duration of movement,
as we have defined it, but
also the duration of rest. On the
other hand, how can we deny that
rest is measured by time, when we
often speak of the rest of a few
minutes or of a few hours?</p>

<p>We might evade the question by
answering that nothing in creation
lies in absolute rest, but everything
is acting and acted upon
without interruption, so that its
movement is never suspended. But
we answer directly that, if there
were absolute rest anywhere in the
world, the duration of that rest
should be measured by the duration
of exterior movements. In
fact, rest has no <em>before</em> and <em>after</em> in
itself, because it is immovable, but
only outside of itself. It cannot
therefore have an intrinsic measure
of its duration, but it must borrow
it from the <em>before</em> and <em>after</em> of exterior
movement. In other words,
the thing which is in perfect rest
draws no line of time; it has only
a statical <em>now</em> which is a mere term
of duration; and if everything
in the world were in absolute
rest, time would cease altogether.
Hence what we call the duration
of rest is simply the duration of a
movement exterior to the thing
which is at rest.</p>

<p>This will be easily understood by
considering that between a flowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
and a standing <em>now</em> there is the
same relation as between a moving
and a standing point.</p>

<p>Now, to change the relation of
distance between two points in
space, it suffices that one of them
move while the other stands still.
This change of distance is measured
by the movement of the first
point; and thus the point which is
at rest undergoes, without moving,
a continuous change in its relation
to the moving point. In a similar
manner, two <em>nows</em> being given, the
one flowing and the other standing,
the time extended by the flowing
of the first measures the change of
its relation to the second, and consequently,
also, the change of the
relation of the second to the first.
This shows that the time by which
we measure the duration of rest is
nothing but the duration of the
movement extrinsic to the thing at
rest.</p>

<p>But, as we have said, nothing in
creation is in absolute rest; and
therefore what we consider as resting
has really some movement imperceptible
to our senses&mdash;as, <i>v.g.</i>,
molecular vibrations&mdash;by which the
duration of its supposed rest is intrinsically
measured. In God’s
eternity alone there is perfect immobility;
but its duration cannot
be measured by time, even as an
extrinsic measure, because the
standing duration of eternity has
nothing common with the flowing
duration of creatures. As local
movement cannot measure divine
immensity, so flowing duration cannot
measure divine eternity; because,
as the <i lang="la">ubi</i> of a creature never
changes its relation to God’s immensity,
so the <i lang="la">quando</i> of a creature
never changes its relation to God’s
eternity.</p>

<p><i>Continuity of time.</i>&mdash;We will conclude
with a few remarks on the
continuity of time. That time is
essentially continuous is evident;
but the question has been proposed:
What if God were to annihilate
all existing creatures, and to
make a new creation? Would the
instant of annihilation be immediately
followed by the instant of
the new creation, or could there be
an interval of time between them?</p>

<p>The right answer to this question
is that between the annihilation
and the new creation there would
be no time: because there cannot
be time without succession, and no
succession without creatures. Yet,
it would not follow that the instant
of the annihilation should be immediately
united with the instant
of the new creation; in other words,
the duration of the new world would
not be a continuation of the duration
of the world annihilated. The
reason of this is that there cannot
be a continuation of time, unless
the same <em>now</em> continues to flow.
For when one flowing <em>now</em> ceases
to be, and another begins, the line
of time drawn by the first comes to
an end, and another line, altogether
distinct, begins, and this latter cannot
be a continuation of the former.
If the English mail, for instance,
reaches New York at a given instant,
and the French mail at the
same instant starts from Paris, no
one will say that the movement of
the French mail is a continuation
of the movement of the English
mail. Hence the duration of the
movement of the one is not the
continuation of that of the other.</p>

<p>Moreover, from what we have
seen about the distinct lines of time
described by distinct subjects of
flowing duration, it is plain that
even the durations of simultaneous
movements are always distinct from
one another, as belonging to distinct
subjects; and accordingly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
when one of the said movements
ceases, the continuation of the
others cannot be looked upon as
its continuation. Hence, if the
present world were annihilated, its
duration would cease altogether;
and the duration of a newly-created
world would draw a new line of
time quite distinct from that of the
present world, though between the
end of the one and the beginning
of the other there would be no time.
“The two worlds in question,” as
Balmes remarks, “would have no
mutual relation; consequently there
would be neither distance nor immediateness
between them.”<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>Time is <em>formally</em> continuous.
Formal continuity we call that of
which all the constituent elements
have their own formal and distinct
existence in nature. In time such
elements are those flowing instants
which unite the immediate past
with the immediate future. This
continuity is essentially successive.
It is owing to its successivity that
time, as well as movement, can be,
and is, formally continuous. For
no formal continuum can be simultaneous,
as we have shown where
we refuted the hypothesis of continuous
matter.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> But let this suffice
about time.</p>

<h3>AN INCIDENT OF THE REIGN OF TERROR.</h3>

<p>The close of the XVIIIth century
found the good people of these
United States in a most amiable
mood. The consciousness of all
they had achieved, by sustaining
their Declaration of Independence
in the face of overwhelming difficulties,
produced a glow of national
self-complacency that has thrown
its glamour over the first page of our
public annals, which&mdash;as history
counts her pages by centuries&mdash;we
are only now preparing to turn.
Not until we were drawing near its
close was the light of that agreeable
illusion obscured by the shadow
of a question whether the “glorious
Fourth” was not like to prove,
after all, a most <em>in</em>glorious failure.</p>

<p>Self-complacency is never an
elevating sentiment, and seldom
sustained by the merits upon the
assumed possession of which it is
based. But our people had many
substantial virtues, sufficient to
atone abundantly for their indulgence
in a pleasant foible. Among
these was the principle of gratitude,
to which none but truly noble natures
are subject. That they possessed
it was proved by their
promptness in hastening to relieve
and comfort the French refugees
whom the Reign of Terror had
driven to our shores when it was
devastating that fair realm across
the Atlantic which had been the
first to extend assistance and sympathy
to us in the hour of need.</p>

<p>We have vivid recollections of
sitting for hours&mdash;patchwork in
hand&mdash;at the feet of a dear relative
in the pleasant home of our childhood,
listening to thrilling tales of
those times, many of them connected
with the French emigrants&mdash;of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the cordial hospitality with which
all the homes of her native city of
Hartford, Conn., were thrown open
to receive these interesting exiles;
of the shifts the inhabitants devised
and the discomforts they endured
in order to provide comfortable
shelter and sustenance for so many
from means already impoverished
by the drain of the conflict through
which we ourselves had but just
passed.</p>

<p>Now, this dear relative was the
possessor of a small gold locket of
antique fashion and exquisite workmanship,
which was an object of
unceasing admiration to our childish
fancy. In form it was an oblong
octagon. The border was a
graceful tiny pattern in mosaic-gold
inlaid with amethyst and pearl.
In the centre were two miniatures
painted on glass with marvellous
distinctness and accuracy: the one
a likeness of that most unfortunate
queen, Marie Antoinette, the other
of her beloved sister-in-law, the
amiable Princess Elizabeth. A
heavy pebble crystal, perfectly
transparent, covered the pictures
without in the least obscuring their
delicate tints. In the back of the
locket was an open space, within
which, our relative said, was once
laid, upon the ground of dark satin
that still remained, a knot formed
by two small locks of glossy, silken
hair, one a light rose-tinged auburn,
the other flaxen with a golden
sheen. A glass covered these also.</p>

<p>After much persuasion our relative
related to us the following</p>

<h4>STORY OF THE LOCKET.</h4>

<p>My father was an officer in the
Continental army, and, soon after
the war of our Revolution closed,
returned to his former home in the
city of Hartford, Conn., where he
accepted an office of high municipal
trust. He was moved by the
generous impulses of his nature to
a life of active benevolence; and
when, in 1792-3, the Revolution in
France drove thousands of her citizens
to take refuge in our republic,
none were more zealous and untiring
than he in seeking out and providing
for the unfortunate strangers.
Every apartment in our spacious
house was soon filled. Rooms
were prepared in the carriage-house
and barns for my brothers and the
domestics of the household, while
my sisters and myself took possession
of a small room in the attic
which had been a repository for the
spare bedding, now called into use.</p>

<p>Among our guests was one lady
who was distinguished by having a
spacious room set apart for her sole
use, and who seldom left it or mingled
with her companions in misfortune
and exile. Upon the rare
occasions when she did appear
briefly in their circle, it was striking
to observe the ceremonious
deference, amounting almost to
veneration, with which she was received.
Where or how my father
found her I never knew; but his
manner towards her was so profoundly
respectful as to impress us
all with feelings akin to fear in her
presence. Yet these impressions
were produced by the demeanor of
others only; for on her own part
there was not the slightest self-assertion
or assumption of stateliness.
Simple and unobtrusive as a child
in her manners, she was indescribably
affable to all; but her countenance
wore an expression which,
when once seen, could never be forgotten.
More forcibly and clearly
than words did it convey the story
that some overwhelming deluge of
calamity had swept from her life
every vestige of earthly hope and
joy. By no outward token did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
she parade her griefs. Her dress,
plain, even severe, in its perfect
neatness and simplicity, displayed
no mourning-badge, but her very
smile was an intimate revelation of
sorrow.</p>

<p>She was known by the title of
“Madame,” though some of our
guests would now and then add,
when speaking of her in an undertone&mdash;not
lost upon a small listener
like myself&mdash;“la Comtesse.” Her
waiting-maid, Celeste, was entirely
devoted to her, and always served
her slight and simple meals to her
in her own room.</p>

<p>Soon after her arrival I was sent
on some errand to madame’s apartment,
and her agitation upon seeing
me was a thing to be remembered
for a lifetime. She drew me to her
bosom, caressing me with many
tears, suppressed sobs, and rapid
exclamations in her own language.
I learned afterwards from Celeste
that I was of the same age and
bore a striking resemblance in form
and face to her daughter, who had
been torn from her in the storm
and turmoil of their escape. They
had been rescued by a faithful servant,
and hurried off, more dead
than alive, in the fright, confusion,
and uproar of a terrible outbreak
in Paris, and had discovered, when
too late, that her daughter had been
separated from them and was missing.
Their deliverer promised to
make every possible effort to find
the child, but Celeste had little
hope; for she had heard from the
servant of another lady, who escaped
later&mdash;but had never told her mistress&mdash;that
one of the women who
daily watched the carts which conveyed
the victims to the guillotine
had averred that she was sure she
saw the child among their number.</p>

<p>From the first I was a welcome
visitor in the lady’s room. She encouraged
me to pass all the time
with her which could be spared
from household duties; for in those
days every child was required to
perform a portion of these. The
schools in Hartford were, for the
most part, closed during that period,
that the buildings might be devoted
to the accommodation of the
strangers, who requited the kindness
by teaching the children of
each household where they were
entertained, daily. I was the
chosen pupil of madame. She
soon imparted sufficient knowledge
of the French to give her instructions
in her own language. Never
was child blest with a more gentle
and painstaking teacher! To a
thorough course in the simple
branches of study she added many
delicate accomplishments then unknown
in our country, and the
most patient training in all matters
connected with dress and deportment.
After lessons she would
hold long conversations with me,
more profitable than the lessons
themselves, awakening interest by
suggestions and inquiries tending to
form habits of thinking, as well as
of acquiring knowledge. Then
such wonderful fairy tales as she
would relate! I used to listen
perfectly entranced. Never have
I heard in English any fairy lore
that would compare with it. Translations
we may have, but the fairy
charm of the original is lost.</p>

<p>At that time the spirit of infidelity
and atheism which laid the train
for the horrors of the French Revolution
prevailed widely in our own
country. When too young to comprehend
their import, I had often listened
to warm discussions between
my father, who was strongly tinctured
with those opinions&mdash;while in
politics he was an ultra-democrat&mdash;and
my maternal grandfather, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
High-Churchman and Tory. The
latter always insisted&mdash;and it was
all I understood of their conversations&mdash;that
it was impossible for a
government founded upon popular
unbelief and insubordination to
stand. He was utterly hopeless for
ours, not because it was democratic
in form, but because the people no
longer reverenced authority, had
ceased to be imbued with the first
principle of loyalty to God as Supreme
Ruler, and to the “powers
that be” as his appointed instruments.
These subjects were themes
of constant debate, and were treated
with a warmth that commanded
even the notice of children.</p>

<p>Some of our guests affected a gay
and careless indifference to the
claims of God and man that
amounted to a rejection of both;
others vehemently denounced all
religion as a figment of priest-craft;
while still another class met such
questions with the solemnity arising
from a conviction of the tremendous
temporal and eternal interests
which they involved.</p>

<p>It was refreshing to steal away
from these evening debates in the
drawing-room to the peaceful atmosphere
of madame’s apartment.
I frequently found her saying her
beads, of which I knew nothing,
only that they were exceedingly
beautiful to the sight, and composed
of very costly materials. I used
to enter her room very quietly, and
take my accustomed seat in silence,
until her devotions were closed.
Of her religion I knew no more
than the name; but its evident influence
upon every action of her
life left an indelible impression
upon my mind that it was a power
above and beyond any of the prevailing
forms around us. She never
spoke expressly of her religion
to me, but the purely Christian tone
of her instructions upon all the duties
of life, social and domestic, exemplified
by her own conduct,
proved abundantly that it was more
than a mere sentiment or a name.
I was too young at that time to
reason upon these things, but, as I
have said, they left an indelible impression,
and, as life advanced, furnished
food for many reveries
which at length ripened into serious
thought.</p>

<p>How the weary months must have
dragged along for those exiled unfortunates!
Yet the cheerfulness,
even gayety, with which they endured
their misfortunes and the
torturing suspense of their position,
was a matter of constant marvel to
their New England friends. They
watched the arrival of every ship
from France with intense anxiety,
and a renewal of grief and mourning
was sure to follow the tidings it
brought. Yet the polite amenities
and courtesies of their daily life,
which seemed a part of their nature,
were never for a moment abated,
and in the wildest storm of grief
even the women never lost that exquisite
sense of propriety which
distinguishes their nation.</p>

<p>And so the time wore on until a
certain memorable night in September,
1794. My father’s residence
was situated upon an elevated
street which commanded a wide
view of the city and its environs.
How well I remember standing
with my sisters by the window of
our attic dormitory, looking out
upon the quiet city sleeping under
the calm light of the harvest moon,
on that never-to-be-forgotten night!
The contemplation of the scene
was too pleasant to be easily relinquished,
and it was late before we
could turn away from its fascinations
to our rest. We were scarcely
lost in sleep when we were awakened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
suddenly by a thrilling shout in
the street, accompanied by the wild
huzzahs of an excited multitude.
We hastened to the lower rooms,
where we found the strangers gathered
around the open windows,
from which they were waving handkerchiefs,
hats, and scarfs, and
mingling their shouts with those of
the throng outside.</p>

<p>In the street the city crier moved
along in advance of the crowd,
mounted on a tall white horse, and
waving an immense banner. At
every crossing he would pause and
shout through a speaking-trumpet,
“Rejoice! rejoice! Robespierre,
the tyrant, has fallen! has fallen!”
Then followed the jubilant cheers
of the rapidly-increasing crowd.
And so they passed on through
every street in the city.</p>

<p>I sought madame’s apartment,
and found her kneeling in the same
reverent attitude of humble devotion
with which I had so long been
familiar. Strange to say, my first
thought upon hearing the news so
joyful to others was one of dismal
apprehension, and my first emotion
one of ineffable sadness! Quick as
thought came the painful assurance
to my heart that this was the signal
for my final separation from the
loving friend, the gentle teacher, to
whom I had become inexpressibly
attached. As she arose and extended
her arms towards me, I
threw myself into them, and, hiding
my face in her bosom, gave way
to a burst of uncontrollable grief.
Words were not necessary to explain
its cause. Understanding it
at a glance, she caressed and soothed
me with assurances of her undying
love, and that she could never
forget or cease to pray for the child
whom heaven had appointed to be
her dearest consolation under her
great afflictions.</p>

<p>My apprehensions proved well
founded. The same ship which
brought tidings of the tyrant’s fall
brought letters also to madame from
faithful friends, urging her immediate
return to France.</p>

<p>My father accompanied her to
Boston, in order to make needful
preparation for her departure on
the next outward-bound vessel. I
was thrown into such an agony of
grief at the thought of parting with
her that madame begged I might
be permitted to go with them, urging
that the change of scene and a
visit to relatives in Boston might
divert my thoughts and soothe the
bitter anguish of my young heart.
He consented, and, when we reached
the city, he left us at the house
of his sister, where I found my
cousins all engaged preparing for
an examination and exhibition
which was to take place the next
day to close the term of the school
they were attending, on the same
street and near by.</p>

<p>They insisted that I should go
with them, and madame dressed me
in a white muslin with a blue sash.
She then hung the locket you so
much admire, suspended from a
delicate gold chain, around my neck,
and I set off with my cousins.</p>

<p>We found the girls grouped together
in great glee, awaiting the
opening exercises. In the centre
of the group was a fair and graceful
girl, near my own age and size,
with a large basket containing bouquets
of flowers arranged with admirable
taste, which the girls were
purchasing for themselves and to
decorate the school-room.</p>

<p>My cousins replied to my questions
about the young stranger:
“Oh! we call her the little flower
girl. She lives with a farmer just
out of the city. The family are
very fond of her, and he gives her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
a little place in the garden to cultivate
flowers, and lets her come with
him on market days to sell them for
herself in the city. She heard of
what was going on here, and thought
this would be a good market for
her bouquets; and so it has been,
for she has sold them all.”</p>

<p>For some reason I could not
turn my eyes from the child. There
seemed to be a mutual fascination
which drew us together, and I observed
she was looking intently
and with much emotion at the
locket I wore. I asked her why
she was so much interested in it.
She answered with a slight French
accent: “My mamma had such a
locket, and all the ladies of the
queen’s household wore them.”</p>

<p>“And where is your mamma?” I
inquired.</p>

<p>“Alas! I do not know if she is
living. I lost her in a great crowd
in the streets of Paris, and was so
frightened at the horrors around
me that I remember nothing until
I found myself on board the ship
which brought me here. How I
came there I never knew. The
kind-hearted farmer with whom I
live was on the wharf when we
landed, and, in great pity for my
bewildering loneliness and grief,
took me to his home, where I have
since received every attention and
sympathy.”</p>

<p>Almost sinking under agitation, I
turned to my cousins, who had been
too much occupied with their own
affairs to notice us, and faintly
gasped: “She is, she must be,
the daughter for whom madame
mourns!”</p>

<p>At the bare suggestion all else
was forgotten! There was an impetuous
huddling of our electrified
companions around the bewildered
little stranger, and a petition that
the school exercises might be delayed
until they could escort her to
my aunt and learn whether my
conjecture was true. So great
was their excitement that it was
useless to deny the request, and we
led our heroine off with hasty steps.</p>

<p>On the way we decided that my
aunt should break the matter gently
to madame, and introduce the
child to her in her room.</p>

<p>There was no need of an introduction!
The moment their eyes
met the exclamations “Antoinette!”
“Mamma!” burst from their lips,
and my aunt left them locked in a
close embrace. The scene was too
sacred for intrusion!</p>

<p>The news flew with the speed of
the wind, and there were great rejoicings
far and near over the
timely discovery brought about by
means of the locket, which madame
bestowed upon me (after removing
the knot of hair, too precious,
as a relic of her lamented queen
and the Princess Elizabeth, to be
relinquished) in memory of this
joyful event, and as a souvenir of
the beloved friend and teacher with
whom I had passed so many happy
and profitable hours.</p>

<p>Soon after the reunion of the
mother and child they sailed for
France, and I returned with my
father to a home which was now
bereft of a charm that could never
be replaced or restored. But my
sympathy with their joy was too
sincere to be chilled by selfish regrets.</p>

<p>During my father’s stay in Boston
he made some final arrangements
connected with a large territory
of wild lands which he had received
from the government in partial
requital of his services in the
army.</p>

<p>To that distant wilderness he removed
his family immediately after
our return. The absence of mail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
communication with such remote
districts, in those days, was doubtless
the reason why we never received
further tidings from one who
had placed us among the favored
few that “have entertained angels
unawares.”</p>

<p>In the loneliness of my forest
home, and through a long life
marked by many changes and sorrows,
I have cherished grateful
memories of the early lessons I received
from her lips, and they have
proved, through their influence upon
my religious and moral being, a
legacy far more precious than a
thousand caskets of gold and precious
stones.</p>

<h3>THE CHARITIES OF ROME.</h3>

<p>The present sacrilegious invaders
of Rome have done much to change
the religious aspect of the city, and
obliterate every trace of the influence
of the popes upon the charities
once so liberally thrown open
to the people of every clime and
color. In the true spirit of modern
“progress,” philanthropy has usurped
the place of charity, and the
state, taking possession of institutions
founded and hitherto directed
in many points by the church, banishes
her as far from them as possible.
It may be interesting to
pass in review some of those magnificent
charities which sprang up
and flourished so long under pontifical
protection, but which have
lately either been violently suppressed
or are fast disappearing
under the difficulties of the political
situation. We will write of
these charities as they existed in
1869, which was the last year during
the whole of which the papal
government had control of them.
In that year an English Protestant
writer, long resident in Rome,
was obliged by the clearness of
facts to tell his readers that “few
cities in Europe are so distinguished
for their institutions of public
charity as Rome, and in none are
the hospitals more magnificently
lodged or endowed with more
princely liberality. The annual endowments
of these establishments
are no less than 258,390 scudi, derived
from lands and houses, from
grants, and from the papal treasury.”</p>

<p>When S. Peter entered Rome
for the first time, and looked upon
the miserable condition of those to
whom the favors of fortune were denied,
he recalled to mind the words
addressed to his forefathers about
to enter into the promised land:
“There shall be no poor nor beggar
among you: that the Lord thy God
may bless thee in the land which
he giveth thee to possess” (Deut.
xv. 4), and saw before him one of
the greatest obstacles to be overcome&mdash;involving
a change of what
was second nature to the Romans
(hardness of heart), they being, as
S. Paul wrote (Rom. i. 31), “without
affection, without mercy”&mdash;but
knowing that it was also said in
the same holy text “Poor will not
be wanting in the land: therefore I
command thee to open thy hand
to thy needy and poor brother,” and
having heard the blessed Lord Jesus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
say of the new dispensation,
“The poor ye have always with
you,” he understood that God’s
object was not to forbid mendicity,
but to leave no room for it. Therefore
to the rich and powerful, when
brought by grace to his apostolic
feet, he enjoined: “Deal thy bread
to the hungry, and bring the needy
and the harborless into thy house”
(Isaias lviii. 7). The faith of the
Roman Christians was illustrious
throughout the world, and so was
their charity. From the days of
S. Peter it had been customary to
take up collections on Sundays in
all the congregations of the city for
the relief of the confessors condemned
to labor in the public
mines and other works, or languishing
in prison, or wandering in
exile; and Eusebius has preserved
in his <cite>Ecclesiastical History</cite>
(lib. iv. cap. 23) the testimony of
Dionysius, Bishop of Corinth (161-192),
in favor of the long-established
charitable institutions of the Romans,
and in praise, at the same
time, of the piety of his contemporary,
Pope S. Soter, who not only retained
these customs of his people,
but surpassed them in sending
money to the Christians of other
parts of the world, and in receiving,
as though they were his own
children, all faithful pilgrims to
Rome. In the year 236 Pope S.
Fabian gave charge of the poor
of Rome to seven deacons each of
whom superintended two of the
fourteen civil divisions or regions,
whence they were called regionary
deacons. A memorial of
their occupation still remains in
the dalmatic, or deacon’s vestment,
the wide sleeves of which served
originally for pockets; and Pope
Innocent III., in his treatise on the
Mass, remarks that this kind of dress
is attributed to deacons because, in
the first institution of their order,
the distribution of alms was assigned
to them. A council of the IVth
century, held under Pope Sylvester,
decreed that one-fourth part of the
church revenues should be set
apart for the poor. S. Jerome attests
in one of his letters that a noble
matron named Fabiola erected
a hospital in the year 400; and
about the same time S. Gallicanus,
a man of consular dignity, who had
also been honored with a triumph,
becoming a Christian, founded a
similar institution at the mouth of
the Tiber for the accommodation
of pilgrims and of the sick. He
waited upon them in person. In
1869 Rome had a population of
about 220,000 inhabitants, and, although
the climate is not unhealthy,
it is hardly one of the most salubrious
in the world. The low land
upon which a great part of the modern
city is built; the turbid Tiber,
which, passing through it in a
winding course, is apt to overflow
its banks; the open position of the
city, which is exposed, according to
the season, either to the sultry African
wind or to the piercing blasts
from the neighboring mountains;
and the large floating population,
which is everywhere a likely subject
of disease, combine to make it desirable
that Rome should be well provided
with institutions of succor and relief.
While under papal rule, she
was not wanting in this respect, but
was even abundantly and excellently
supplied.</p>

<p>Man, being composed of spirit
and matter, having consequently a
soul and a body to look after, has
wants of two kinds, corresponding
to the twofold claims of his nature.
We should therefore divide the
charities man is capable of receiving
into two classes. He received
them in Rome with a generous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
hand. The first class comprehended
relief to the indigent, the sick,
the destitute, the insane, the convalescent;
possessed hospitals and
asylums, brought aid into private
families, opened nocturnal retreats,
offered work to the honest needy,
gave marriage portions to the nubile,
shielded widows, protected
orphans, advanced money on the
easiest terms. These were charities
of subsistence. The second
class embraced poor schools and
other establishments for gratuitous
education in trades, arts, and
sciences, conservatories for the exposed,
hospices for the reformed,
and made provision for the legal
defence of the weak. These were
called charities of education.</p>

<p>There were two institutions in
Rome that assisted the poor before
they had fallen into misery or become
destitute. These were the
<i lang="it">Monte di Pietà</i> and the savings-bank.
The first was a bank of
loan and deposit. The idea of
such an institution was suggested
by a pious and shrewd Franciscan,
named Barnabas of Terni, who was
painfully struck, during a mission
he was giving in Perugia in the
year 1462, by the enormous usury
(a crime then practised almost exclusively
by Jews) which the poor
were forced to pay for any advance
of money they might need. This
practical friar prevailed upon several
wealthy persons to mass sums
of money into one fund, out of
which to lend to the poor at a reasonable
(and in some cases merely
nominal) rate of interest. Hence
the distinctive name of Monte di
Pietà, which means literally mountain
of mercy. The Roman <i lang="it">Monte</i>
was the third institution of the sort
that was opened. This was in the
year 1539. It was to lend money
up to a certain amount without
taking interest; above this amount
for a very small interest. It was to
take articles on pawn, and give
the appraised value, less one-third.
Over $100,000 used, under the papal
government, to be annually loaned
out on pawns or otherwise without
one cent of interest. This establishment
occupied a superb public
building, and was under the control
of the Minister of Finance.
Honest visitors were freely admitted
into every part of it; and we
have heard many (even hard-fisted)
English and Americans express
themselves surprised, if not satisfied,
with this reasonable and conscientious
manner of saving the
poor from the gripe of usurers
and pawn-brokers, while imposing
enough restraint to discourage improvidence.
No hope was held
out of indiscriminate relief. Looking
at the <i lang="it">Monte</i> in an antiquarian
light, it was a perfect museum of
modern life, and to go through it
was as good as visiting a hundred
consolidated old curiosity-shops.
Its administration employed, including
a detachment of the Swiss
Guard, one hundred persons. The
capital, which consisted of every
kind of property that at various
periods and from many benefactors
had come to it, was about three
million dollars. The most orthodox
political economists acknowledge
that institutions of this sort
were devised only as a lesser evil;
and consequently the Roman government
was glad to see the business
of the <i lang="it">Monte</i> fall away considerably
after the opening of the
savings-bank in 1836. This was a
charitable institution, because it
was governed gratuitously by an
administration of eleven honest and
intelligent men, among whom were
some of the first nobility, who thus
gave a portion of their time and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
talents to the poor. The cashier,
Prince Borghese, gave, besides his
services, a part of his magnificent
palace to be turned into offices for
the business transactions of the
bank.</p>

<p>The Apostolic Almonry in the
Vatican next claimed our attention
in the quiet days of the Pope.
From the earliest period the vicars
of Christ have made it a practice
to visit in person the poor, and distribute
alms with their own hands,
in love and imitation of Him who
“went about doing good.” As the
wealth of the church in Rome increased,
it was found necessary for
the better ordering of things to
have some administrative assistance
in the distribution of these private
charities. S. Conon I., in the VIIth
century, employed the arch-priest
Paschal to dispense the bounty of
the privy purse; and in the year
1271 Blessed Gregory X. created
the perpetual office of grand almoner
in the papal court. This
officer is always an archbishop <i lang="la">in
partibus</i>, and lives under the same
roof as the Holy Father, in order
to be ready at all times to receive
his commands. Besides the many
standing largitions issued from the
Grand Almonry, there were occasional
ones, such as the largess of
$300 which was distributed in the
great court-yard of Belvidere on
each anniversary of the Pope’s
coronation. This sum was doubled
the first year. On each of the
following civil or religious festivals,
Christmas, Easter, and Coronation
day, $165 were divided among a
certain number of the best-behaved
prisoners confined in Rome.
About $650 a month were paid out
either at the word of the sovereign
or on his order; while a sum of
$2,000 was annually divided among
one hundred poor families. Besides
this, the Grand Almonry supported
a number of free schools,
dispensed food and medicines, and
performed many acts of more secret
charity. A memorial of the
earlier personal distribution of alms
by the popes is retained in the <i lang="la">Succinctorium</i>,
which they wear in solemn
pontificals. It is an ornament
of silk of the color of the feast,
fringed with gold, and suspended
down the left side from the girdle.
On Good Friday the succinctory is
not worn, in execration of the evil
use Judas Iscariot made of the
purse when he betrayed our Lord
for thirty pieces of silver.</p>

<p>Another of the great charities
of Rome was the Commission of
Subsidies established by Pope Leo
XII., in 1826, to give assistance
and employment to poor but honest
people, willing to help themselves
if they could find the opportunity.
The whole tendency of Roman charities
under the popes was to frown upon
sloth and vagrancy, and encourage
self-reliance and mutual support;
for S. Paul wrote to the Thessalonians
(2, iii. 10): “If any man will not
work, neither let him eat.” The
commission received a yearly subsidy
from government of $88,500.
In each of the fourteen rioni or
wards of the city a physician, surgeon,
pharmacist, and midwife rendered
gratuitous services under its
control. It was by the judicious
employment of such men, thrown
on the hands of the commission,
that within the last thirty years so
much was done in making excavations
in and about Rome in search
of antiquities and in studying its
ancient topography. We have sometimes
heard English and American
sight-seers make brutal remarks
about “those dirty, lazy Romans,”
as they would stop a moment to
look at some party of these poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
fellows taking their work so easily
in the Forum, on the Palatine, or elsewhere;
but we should rather applaud
the paternal government
that refrained from calling poverty
a crime or driving the poor and
weak to their work like galley-slaves;
and while contributing a
generous support, gave them enough
to do to save their self-respect.</p>

<p>No such thing as work-houses,
in the English sense, have ever
been maintained where Catholic
influences have predominated; and
for this we may thank God.</p>

<p>Another category of Roman charities
comprised the confraternities.
These associations for purposes of
piety and mutual help convey in
their name the idea of brotherliness
and union. There were no
fewer than ninety-one confraternities
in Rome under the popes. The
oldest and most famous of these
was the Annunciation, which was
founded in 1460 by the Dominican
Cardinal John Torquemada, in
Santa Maria-in-Minerva, the head
church of his order in Rome.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Its
particular object was to give portions
to poor but virtuous young
females, that they might either marry
or enter a religious house if
they had a vocation. On the 25th
of March, Lady-day, the pope, cardinals,
and prelates, with the rest
of the court, used to assist at Mass
in that church, and preside at the
distribution of dowers which followed
immediately. The girls were
always dressed in plain white; such
as had signified their choice of the
heavenly Spouse being distinguished
by a wreath on the head. On
this occasion the pontiff gave one
hundred golden scudi, and each
cardinal present gave one, to the
funds of the confraternity. There
were fourteen other confraternities
that had the same object, although
carried out with less solemnity. In
this way $42,000 used to be expended
annually.</p>

<p>The Confraternity of the Twelve
Apostles made it a special point to
find out and relieve in a delicate
manner those who, having known
better days, were fallen into reduced
circumstances. The Confraternity
of Prayer and Death buried
the dead; and if an accident in
or about Rome was reported in
which life was lost, a party was detailed
to go and bring the body
in decently for Christian burial.
Sometimes a poor herdsman on the
Campagna had been gored by an
ox, or some fellow had been swept
away and drowned in the Tiber, or
perhaps a reaper been prostrated
by the heat; at whatever hour of
the day or night, and at all seasons,
a band of this confraternity went
out, and returned carrying the unfortunate
person on a stretcher
upon their shoulders. It must be
remarked in this connection that
the members of the confraternity
always observed the laws concerning
deaths of this kind, not interfering
with, but merely placing
themselves at the disposal of, the
officers of justice, to give a body
burial at their own expense and in
consecrated ground. The Confraternity
of Pity for Prisoners was
founded in 1575 by Father John
Tallier, a French Jesuit. It provided
religious instruction for prisoners,
distributed objects of piety
among them, looked after their
families if destitute, and assisted
them to pay their debts and fines
if they had any. The Confraternity
of S. John Baptist was composed
exclusively of Florentines and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
descendants of Florentines. Its
object was to comfort and assist to
the last, criminals condemned to
death. As decapitation was the
mode of judicial punishment, S.
John Baptist, who was slain by Herod,
was their patron, and his head
on a charger the arms of the confraternity.
Although there were
so many confraternities and other
pious associations in Rome, connected
by their object with institutions
of every kind, sanitary, corrective,
etc., they were very careful
never to interfere with the regulations
of such establishments; and
consequently, by minding their own
business, they were not in the way
of the officials, but, on the contrary,
were looked upon as valuable assistants.
The Society of S. Vincent
of Paul was started in Rome
in 1842 by the late venerable Father
de Ravignan, S.J. It counted twenty-eight
conferences and one thousand
active members, clergy and laymen,
titled folks and trades-people
all working harmoniously together.
About $2,100 was annually dispensed
by the society. The Congregation
of Ladies was founded in 1853 by
Monsignor&mdash;now Cardinal&mdash;Borromeo
to give work, especially needle-work,
to young women out of employment.
A great many ecclesiastical
vestments were thus made
under the direction of the ladies,
and either sent as presents to poor
missions, or sold, for what they
would bring, at the annual fair
held for the purpose of disposing
of them.</p>

<p>There were seven public hospitals
in Rome, under the immediate
direction of a general board of administration
composed of twelve
members, of whom three belonged
to the clergy and the rest to the
laity. The oldest, largest, and best-appointed
institution of this kind
was Santo Spirito, situated in the
Leonine quarter of the city, on the
border of the Tiber. Its site has
been occupied by a charitable institution
ever since <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 728; the
earliest building having been founded
there for his countrymen by
Ina, King of Wessex. For this reason
the whole pile of buildings is
called Santo Spirito <em>in Saxia</em>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
in the quarter of the (West) Saxons.
There are three distinct establishments
under the administration of
Santo Spirito&mdash;viz., the hospital itself,
the Foundling Hospital, and
the Lunatic Asylum. The first was
founded by Pope Innocent III. in
1198, the Saxons having abandoned
this locality for a more central position&mdash;the
present S. Thomas-of-the-English.
It has received since
then many additions, until it has assumed
the enormous proportions
that we now admire. Every improvement
was made to keep pace with
the advance of hygienic knowledge.
This hospital was for men only. It
had 1,616 beds and an annual average
of 14,000 patients. The wards
were twelve in number, in which the
cleanliness was refreshing, the ventilation
excellent, and the water-supply
pure and abundant. The
principal parts of the exterior, and
some of the interior parts of the
building, were by distinguished
architects; while some of the wards
had their ceilings and upper walls
painted in fresco with scenes from
Sacred Scripture, such as the sufferings
of Job and the miraculous cures
made by our Lord. Not only the
eye but the ear too of the poor patients
was pleased; for three times a
week they were entertained with
organ music from a lofty choir
erected at one end of the largest
wards. The spiritual care of the
sick was perfect; it was impossible
for any one to die without the rites<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
of the church. In the centre of
every ward there was a fixed altar,
upon which Mass was said daily.
The Confraternity of Santo Spirito,
composed of clergy and laymen, assisted
the regular ministers of religion
in attendance day and night.
These volunteers brought flowers
to the patients, read to them, prepared
them for confession and other
sacraments, and disposed them to
die a good death, besides performing
for them the most menial services.</p>

<p>We remember to have read a letter
addressed to the New York <cite>Post</cite>
by an eminent Protestant clergyman
of New York, in which, after describing
this institution (then under
papal rule), he said that he could
not speak too highly of the excellent
attendance the patients received
from the kind-hearted religious
who were stationed there, and added
that if ever he had to come to a
hospital, he hoped it would be
Santo Spirito. The Foundling Hospital
was opened by Pope Innocent
III.; and the Lunatic Asylum, for
both sexes, was founded in 1548 by
three Spaniards, a priest and two
laymen. It was called the House
of Our Lady of Mercy. A fine
garden on the Janiculum Hill was
attached to it for the recreation of
the patients. We do not know how
it is conducted since it has changed
hands, but formerly it was managed
on the system of kindness towards
even the fiercest madmen, using
only so much restraint as was positively
necessary. It was then under
the care of religious. The Hospital
of the Santissimo Salvatore, near
St. John of Lateran, was founded
in 1236 by a Cardinal Colonna.
It was for women only. Another
Cardinal Colonna founded the Hospital
of S. James, for incurables, in
1339. Our Lady of Consolation
was a fine hospital near the Forum
for the maimed and wounded; while
San Gallicano, on the other side of
the river, was for fevers and skin-diseases.
San Rocco was a small
lying-in hospital, with accommodation
for 26 women. It was founded
at the beginning of the XVIIth
century by a Cardinal Salviati.
The most delicate precautions were
always used there to save any sense
of honor that might still cling to a
victim of frailty. Guilt could at
least blush unnoticed. The Santissima
Trinità was founded by S.
Philip Neri for convalescents of
both sexes and for poor pilgrims.
It could lodge 488 patients, had
beds for 500 pilgrims, and table-room
for 900. In the great refectory
of this building the members
of the confraternity came on every
Holy Thursday evening to wash the
feet of the pilgrims and wait on
them at table. Of course the two
sexes were in different parts of the
building, and each was attended by
its own. We remember the delightful
ardor with which the late Cardinal
Barnabo on such occasions
would turn up his sleeves, twitch
his apron, and, going down on his
knees, give some poor man’s feet a
better washing than they had had
before in a year. There was much
raising of soap-suds in that wooden
tub, and a real, earnest kiss on one
foot when the washing was over.
The Hospital of S. John Calabyta
was so called from a Spaniard, the
founder of the Brothers of Charity
(commonly called the <i lang="it">Benfratelli</i>),
who attended it. It was opened in
1581, on the island of the Tiber;
and by a coincidence then perhaps
unknown, but since fully brought
to light, it stood on the very site of
an <i lang="la">asclepium</i> which the priests of Esculapius
kept near their god’s temple
two thousand years ago. The Hospital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
of Santa Galla was founded in
1650 by the princely Odescalchi
family. It gave a night asylum to
homeless men. There were 224
beds, distributed through nine
dormitories. Another night refuge,
called S. Aloysius, was founded
about the year 1730 by Father Galluzzi,
a Florentine Jesuit. It is for
women. We can get some idea of
the great charity such refuges are
when we know that during the year
ending December, 1869, no less than
135,000 persons sought a resting-place
at night in the station-houses
of New York. Besides these public
hospitals, almost every Catholic
country had a private national one.
One of the picturesque and not
least of the Roman charities used
to be the daily distribution of food
at the gates of monasteries, convents,
and nunneries, the portals of
palaces, and the doors of seminaries,
colleges, and boarding-schools.</p>

<p>With all this liberality, there was
still some room for hand-alms.
There used to be beggars in Rome;
assassins have taken their place.
Under the papal government a limit
was put to beggary, and we have
never seen the <em>sturdy</em> beggar who
figures so maliciously in some Protestant
books about Rome. Beggary
may become an evil; it is not
a crime. We confess to liking beggars
if they are not too numerous
and importunate. Few scenes have
seemed to us more venerable, picturesque,
and Christian than the
double row of beggars, with their
sores and crippled limbs, their
sticks and battered hats and outstretched
hands, imploring <i lang="it">per è
amore di Dio</i>, as we pass between
them to the church or cemetery or
other holy place on feast-day afternoons
in Rome.</p>

<p>The Hospice of San Michele was
founded in 1686 by a Cardinal
Odescalchi. In this asylum nearly
800 persons used to be received.
They were divided into four classes&mdash;old
men, old women, boys, and
girls. The institution had an annual
endowment of $52,000; but
some years ago the aged of both
sexes were removed elsewhere, and
their part of the building was converted
into a house of correction
for women and juvenile offenders.
The hospice, in its strict sense, now
consists of a House of Industry
for children of both sexes, and a
gratuitous school of the industrial
and fine arts. The carping author
of Murray’s <cite>Hand-book</cite> (1869), although
he acknowledges that this
school of arts has produced some
eminent men, says that “the education
of the boys might be turned,
perhaps, to more practically useful
objects!” As if, forsooth, it were a
lesser charity, in the great home of
the arts that Rome is, to help a
poor lad of talent to become an architect,
for instance, than to make
him a tailor! The orphan asylum
of Saint Mary of the Angels was
near the Baths of Diocletian. The
boys numbered 450, under the care
of male religious, and the girls 500,
under that of female religious.
The institution received annually
$38,000 from the Commission of
Subsidies. In the same quarter of
the city is the Deaf and Dumb Asylum.
It was opened in 1794 by
Father Silvestri, who had been sent
to Paris by Pope Pius VI. to receive
instruction from the celebrated
Abbé de l’Epée in the art of
teaching this class of unfortunates.
Visitors to the house are made welcome,
and are often invited to test
the knowledge of the pupils by asking
them questions on the blackboard.
The first time we called
there was in 1862, and, having asked
one of the boys, taken at hazard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
who was the first President of the
United States, we were a little surprised
(having thought to puzzle
him) to have the correct answer at
once. The House of Converts
was an establishment where persons
who wished to become Catholics
were received for a time and
instructed in the faith. It was
founded in 1600 by a priest of the
Oratory. Other interesting hospices
were the Widows’ Home and
the House for Aged Priests, where
the veterans of the Roman clergy
could end their days in honorable
comfort. A peculiar class of Roman
charities were the conservatories.
They were twenty-three in
number. Some of them were for
penance, others for change of life,
and others again to shield unprotected
virtue. The Infant Asylum
was a flourishing institution directed
by female religious. Even fashion
was made to do something for
it, since a noble lady years ago suggested
that the members of good
society in Rome should dispense
with their mutual New Year visits
on condition of giving three pauls
(a small sum of money) to the asylum,
and having their names published
in the official journal.</p>

<p>The Society for the Propagation
of the Faith was established at
Rome in 1834. No city of the size
and population of Rome was better
supplied with free schools of every
description. The night-schools
were first opened in 1819. In connection
with studies we should
mention the liberal presents of
books, vestments, and liturgical articles
made to young missionaries
by the Propaganda, and the books
on learned subjects, which, being
printed at government expense, were
sold at a reduced price to students
of every nation on showing a certificate
from one of their professors.</p>

<p>It is written (Matthew iv. 4),
“Man liveth not by bread alone”;
and consequently Rome multiplied
those pious houses of retreat in
which the soul could rest for a time
from the cares of life. There were
five such establishments in the
city. Another great Roman charity
was the missions preached by
the Jesuits and Franciscans in and
around the city, thus bringing the
truths of the Gospel constantly before
the people. We have given
but a brief sketch of our subject.
It has been treated in a complete
manner by Cardinal Morichini in a
new and revised edition of his interesting
work entitled <cite>Degl’ Istituti
di Pubblica Carità ed istruzione primaria
e delle prigioni in Roma</cite>.</p>

<h3>PROGRESS <i lang="la">VERSUS</i> GROOVES.</h3>

<p>“How do you like your new minister,
Mrs. B.?”</p>

<p>“Very much indeed! He is
progressive&mdash;is not fixed in any of
the old grooves. His mind does
not run in those ancient ruts that
forbid advance and baffle modern
thought.”</p>

<p>How strangely this colloquy between
a Methodist and Congregationalist
fell upon the Catholic ear
of their mutual friend! Comment,
however, was discreetly forborne.
That friend had learned in the very
infancy of a Catholic life, beginning
at the mature age of thirty-five
by the register, the futility of
controversy, and that the pearls of
truth are too precious to be carelessly
thrown away. Strangely
enough these expressions affected
one whose habits of thought and
conduct had been silently forming
in accordance with that life for
twenty-five years!</p>

<p>“Old grooves” indeed! Lucifer
found them utterly irreconcilable
with his “advanced ideas” in heaven.
Confessedly, the success of
his progressive enterprise was not
encouraging; but the battle and
its results established his unquestionable
claim as captain and leader
of the sons and daughters of
progress for all time.</p>

<p>“Modern thought!” So far as
we can discover, the best it has
done for its disciples is to prove to
them beyond a doubt that their
dear grandpapa of eld was an ape,
and that they, when they shake off
this mortal coil, will be gathered to
their ancestors in common with
their brethren, the modern monkeys!</p>

<p>We, who believe the authentic
history of the past, can see in this
boasted new railroad, upon which
the freight of modern science and
advanced civilization is borne, a
pathway as old as the time when
our dear, credulous old grandmamma
received a morning call in
Eden from the oldest brother of
these scientific gentlemen, who convinced
her in the course of their
pleasant chat that poor deluded
Adam and herself were fastened in
the most irrational rut&mdash;a perfect
outrage upon common sense&mdash;and
that a very slight repast upon “advanced
ideas” would lift them out
of it, emancipate thought, and
make them as “gods knowing good
and evil.”</p>

<p>We all know how well they succeeded
in their first step on the
highway of progress. They lost a
beautiful garden, it is true, of limited
dimensions, but they gained a
world of boundless space, and a
freedom of thought and action
which was first successfully and
completely illustrated by their first-born
son when he murmured,
“Why?” and killed his brother,
who was evidently attached to
grooves.</p>

<p>They left the heritage thus gained
to a large proportion of their
descendants. A minority of them,
it is true, prefer to “seek out the
old paths” of obedience to the
commands of God, “and walk
therein”&mdash;to shun the “broad
road” along which modern civilization
is rolling its countless throngs,
and to “enter in at the strait
gate” which leadeth to life eternal,
to the great disgust of the disciples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
of modern thought, who spare no
effort to prove their exceeding liberality
by persecuting such with
derision, calumny, chains, imprisonment,
and death!</p>

<p>Thank God this is all they can
do! Rage they never so furiously,
He that sitteth in the heavens laughs
them to scorn. He will defend and
preserve his anointed against all the
combined hosts of Bismarcks, kaisers,
and robber princes, who illustrate
the liberal ideas that govern
the march of modern civilization.</p>

<h3>TRACES OF AN INDIAN LEGEND.</h3>

<p>It has been said of our energetic
republic that it had no infancy;
that it sprang into a vigorous and
complete existence at a bound.
However true this may be with respect
to its material structure in
the hands of the remarkable men
who first planted colonies on American
soil, there is another view of
the picture which presents widely
different features.</p>

<p>To the eye of the Christian philosopher
the religious and moral aspects
of our country to this day
afford subjects for anything but satisfactory
reflection.</p>

<p>The pioneers of civilization along
the northeastern borders of our
territory were&mdash;whatever their professions
to the contrary may have
been&mdash;worshippers of material prosperity.
The worship of God and
the claims of religion were indeed
important and proper in their place
for a portion of the seventh part
of each week, but the moment they
came in conflict with Mammon
there was little question which
should yield. It was not to be expected
that the saints whom the
Lord had specially chosen, and unto
whom “He had given the earth,”
should be diverted from their pursuit
of the great “main chance” by
precepts which were applicable only
to ordinary and less favored mortals.</p>

<p>Whatever progress the church
has yet achieved in this region
is the result of appalling labors
and sacrifices. The foundation
was laid in sufferings, fatigues,
and perils, from the contemplation
of which the self-indulgent Christians
of our day would shrink
aghast; laid long before the so-called
Pilgrim fathers landed at
Plymouth, while the savage still
roamed through the unbroken forests
of New England, and disputed
dominion with wild beasts hardly
more dangerous than himself to
the messengers of the Gospel of
peace. Amid the wonderful beauty
and variety of the panorama which
her mountains, lakes, and valleys
unfold to the tourists and pleasure-seekers
of to-day, there is scarcely
a scene that has not been traversed
in weariness, in hunger, and cold by
those dauntless servants of God
who first proclaimed the tidings of
salvation to the wild children of
the forest.</p>

<p>Futile, and even foolish, as the
toils of these early fathers may appear
to the materialist and utilitarian
of this day, because of their
tardy and apparently inadequate
fruits, the designs of Heaven have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
not been frustrated, and its light reveals
a very different history. We
read therein how He who causes
“the weak and foolish things of
this world to confound the wise”
and to proclaim his praise, sent
his ministering angels to hover over
the pathway moistened with the
tears and blood of his servants, to
note each footprint through the
dreary wilderness, to gather the incense
of each prayer, and to mark
each pain and peril of their sacrificial
march for record in the archives
of eternity, as an earnest for
future good to those regions, and
as enduring testimony before the
high court of heaven to their fitness
for the crown&mdash;far surpassing
in glory all earthly crowns&mdash;which
they won by their burning zeal and
unwavering patience.</p>

<p>Nor were their efforts in the field
of their earthly labors so vain as
some of our modern historians
would have us suppose. Prayer
and exertion in the service of God
are never fruitless. If it is true&mdash;as
the great Champlain was wont
to say&mdash;“that one soul gained for
heaven was of more value than the
conquest of an empire for France,”
they gained from the roving tribes
of the desert many sincere and steadfast
adherents to the faith&mdash;whose
names are recorded in the book
of life&mdash;and scattered benedictions
along their painful pathway which
have shed their beneficent influences
over the scenes they traversed
down to the present day. We
hope to illustrate and sustain this
assertion in the following sketch,
drawn from our memory, of traditions&mdash;preserved
among the Indians
of St. Regis&mdash;to which we listened
many years ago.</p>

<p>Scattered along the southern
shores of the St. Lawrence, from
the foot of Lake Ontario to the village
of St. Regis&mdash;while St. Lawrence
County, N.Y., was yet for
the most part covered with primitive
forests&mdash;were many encampments
of these Indians. That
whole region abounded in game
and furnished favorite hunting-grounds,
to which they claimed a
right in connection with their special
reservation in the more immediate
neighborhood of St. Regis.
At each of these encampments an
aged Indian was sure to be found,
who, without the title of chief, was
a kind of patriarch among his
younger brethren, exercised great
influence in their affairs, and was
treated with profound respect by
them. He was their umpire in all
disputes, their adviser in doubtful
matters, and the “leader of prayer”
in his lodge&mdash;always the largest and
most commodious of the wigwams,
and the one in which they assembled
for their devotions.</p>

<p>One of the oldest of these sages&mdash;called
“Captain Simon”&mdash;must
have been much more than a hundred
years of age, judging from the
dates of events of which he retained
a distinct remembrance as an
eye-witness, and which occurred in
the course of the French and Indian
wars, over a century previous
to the time when we listened to his
recital. His head was an inexhaustible
store-house of traditions
and legends, many of them relating
to the discovery and settlement of
Canada and the labors of the first
missionaries. He was very fond
of young people, and, gathering
the children of the white settlers
around him, he would hold them
spell-bound for hours while he related
stories of those early days in
his peculiarly impressive and figurative
language. He claimed that
his grandfather was one of the
party who accompanied Champlain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
on his first voyage through the lake
which bears his name, and that he
afterwards acted as guide and interpreter
to the first priest who visited
the valley of Lake Champlain.
When he heard that we were from
Vermont, he asked for a piece of
chalk, and, marking on the floor an
outline of the lake and the course
of the Richelieu River, he proceeded
to narrate the voyage of
Champlain and his party in the
summer of 1609.</p>

<p>Embosomed within the placid
waters of Lake Champlain, near its
northern extremity, is a lovely island,
of which Vermonters boast as
the “Gem of the Lake,” so remarkable
is it for beauty and fertility.
Here the party landed, and Champlain,
erecting a cross, claimed the
lake&mdash;to which he gave his own
name&mdash;its islands and shores, for
France and for Christianity. Half
a century later one La Motte built
a fort upon this island, which he
named St. Anne, giving the island
his own name; and it is called the
Isle La Motte to this day.</p>

<p>Champlain explored the lake as
far as Crown Point, where they encountered
and defeated a band of
Iroquois Indians; but not deeming
it wise to adventure further at that
time so near such powerful foes,
they returned down the lake without
delay. This encounter was
the first act of that savage drama
which so long desolated New
France, and threatened it with entire
destruction.</p>

<p>Six years later, in the summer
of 1615, another party landed on
the Isle La Motte. It was made
up of a missionary of the Recollect
Order and his escort of Indians in
two bark canoes. The grandfather
of our narrator was one of these.
They remained a day or two on
the island, and the missionary offered
the Christian sacrifice for the
first time within the territory now
embraced by the State of Vermont.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>The object of his journey was to
visit scattered bands of hunters who
were encamped along the eastern
shore of the lake and its vicinity,
at different points in the valley of
Lake Champlain.</p>

<p>Leaving the Isle La Motte, they
steered for the mouth of the Missisque
River, which they navigated
up to the first falls, where the village
of Swanton now stands. Here
they found a flourishing encampment,
and remained some days for
the purpose of instructing the Indians
in the truths of Christianity.
The missionary found that some
dim reports of the Christian teachers
had preceded him, and prepared
the way for his work, the success
of which encouraged and consoled
him.</p>

<p>From that place they proceeded
on foot for some miles to the base
of a line of hills, sketched by the
narrator, and corresponding to
those east of St. Alban’s. Here
they also remained several days,
the reverend father toiling early
and late in the duties of his vocation.
He was now surrounded by
a crowd of eager listeners; for not
only did his former audience accompany
him, but a goodly number
from the surrounding hills and
from Bellamaqueau and Maquam
Bays&mdash;distant three and five miles
respectively&mdash;flocked to hear his
instructions and to be taught “The
Prayer” revealed to them by the
Great Spirit through his servant.</p>

<p>Here they brought to him also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
the beautiful Indian maiden, of
whom her race cherish the legend
that her declining health led her
people to bring her to these hills,
hoping the change from the low
lands and damp atmosphere of her
home to the bracing mountain air
might prove beneficial. Instead
of finding relief, she only declined
the more rapidly, so that she was
soon unable to be carried back.
She, too, had heard whispers of
holy men who had come to teach
her race the path of heaven, and
wistfully she had sighed daily, as
she repeated the yearning aspiration:
“Oh! if the Great Spirit would
but let me see and listen to his
messenger, I could die in peace!”</p>

<p>The Indians, to this day, tell with
what joy she listened to his words;
how eagerly she prayed that she
might receive the regenerating waters;
how, when they were poured
upon her head, her countenance became
bright with the light of heaven;
and how her departure soon
after was full of joy and peace. Her
burial-place was made on one of
those eastern hills. It was the first
Christian burial for one of her race
in Vermont, and her people thought
her intercessions would not fail to
bring down blessings upon all that
region.</p>

<p>Pursuing their journey by the
trail of those who had preceded
them through the dense wilderness&mdash;for
our aborigines were skilled
in tracing lines of communication
between their different camps with
extreme directness by aid of their
close observations of nature&mdash;the
party arrived at another camp on
the bank of a river discovered by
Champlain, and named by him the
Lamoille.</p>

<p>At this place an Indian youth
came to the missionary in great distress.
His young squaw was lying
at the point of death, and the medicine
men and women could do nothing
more for her. Would not
“The Prayer” restore her? Oh!
if it would give her back to him, he,
with all his family, would gratefully
embrace it! The reverend father
went to her, and, when he found she
desired it, baptized her and her
new-born infant in preparation for
the death which seemed inevitable.
Contrary to all expectation, she recovered.
Her husband and his
family, together with her father’s
family, afterwards became joyful
believers.</p>

<p>After some days the Indians of
that place accompanied the party
in canoes to the lake and along its
shores to the mouth of the Winooski
River, which they ascended as
far as the first falls. Here they remained
many days, during which
time the missionary visited the present
site of Burlington, and held
two missions there&mdash;one at a camp
on the summit of a hill overlooking
the valley of the Winooski as it
approaches the lake, and one near
the lake shore.</p>

<p>If Vermonters who are familiar
with the magnificent scenery which
surrounds the “queen city” of
their State never visit the place
without being filled with new admiration
at the infinite variety and
beauty of the pictures it unfolds
from every changing point of view,
we may imagine how strangers must
be impressed who gaze upon them
for the first time. Not less picturesque,
and if possible even more
striking, were its features when,
crowned by luxuriant native forests
and fanned by gentle breezes from
the lake, it reposed within the embrace
of that glorious amphitheatre
of hills, in the undisturbed tranquillity
of nature. It was not
strange that the natives were drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
by its unparalleled attractions to congregate
there in such numbers as to
require from their reverend visitor
a longer time than he gave to any
other place in this series of missions.</p>

<p>In the course of three months
the party had traversed the eastern
border of the lake to the last encampment
near its southern extremity.
This was merely a summer
camp, as the vicinity of the
Iroquois made it unsafe to remain
there longer than through that
portion of the season when the Mohawks
and their confederates were
too busy with their own pursuits
among the hills of the Adirondacks
to give much heed to their neighbors.
At the close of the mission
this camp was broken up for
that season, and its occupants joined
the reverend father and his party
in canoes as far as the mouth of
the Winooski River, whence men
were sent to convey them to the
starting-point at Swanton, where
their own canoes were left.</p>

<p>On their way thither they lingered
for some days on Grand Isle,
then, as now, a vision of loveliness
to all admirers of the beautiful, and
a favorite annual resort of the natives
for the period during which
they were safe from the attacks of
their merciless foes.</p>

<p>At every mission thus opened the
missionary promised to return himself,
or send one of his associates,
to renew his instructions and minister
to the spiritual wants of his
converts. This promise was fulfilled
as far as the limited number of
laborers in this vineyard permitted.
The brave and untiring sons of
Loyola afterwards entered the field,
and proved worthy successors of
the zealous Recollects who first
announced the Gospel message in
those wilds.</p>

<p>Our Indian narrator, when he
had finished his recital of missionary
labors in this and other regions,
would always add with marked emphasis:
“And it is firmly believed
by our people, among all their
tribes, that upon every spot where
the Christian sacrifice was first
offered a Catholic church will one
day be placed.”</p>

<p>There seemed to his Protestant
listeners but slight probability of
this prediction ever being fulfilled
in Vermont&mdash;settled for the most
part by the straitest sect of the
Puritans&mdash;as there was not then,
or until twenty years from that
time, a Catholic priest or church
in the State. Yet at this writing&mdash;and
the fact has presented itself
before us with startling effect
while tracing these imperfect reminiscences&mdash;there
is at every point
indicated in his narrative a fine
church, and in many places flourishing
Catholic schools.</p>

<p>The labors of an eminent servant
of God&mdash;to whom Vermont cannot
be too grateful&mdash;have been particularly
blessed on the Isle La Motte,
where the banner of the cross was
first unfurled within her territory.
A beautiful church has been erected
there with a thriving congregation
and school.</p>

<p>Much as remains to be accomplished
in this field, when we reflect
upon all that has been done since
the first quarter of this XIXth century,
we can see great cause for
encouragement and gratitude to Almighty
God, who has not withheld
his blessing from the work of
his servants of the earliest and the
latest times. “Going on their way,
they went and wept, scattering the
seed,” the fruits of which we are
now gathering into sheaves with
great joy.</p>

<h3>FINDING A LOST CHURCH.</h3>

<p>The present age is pre-eminently
one of discovery. In spite of the
wise man’s saying, “Nothing under
the sun is new,” mankind, wiser
in its own conceit than the wise
man, insists upon the newness of its
every production. In Rome a different
spirit prevails. While the
new is not entirely neglected, the
great delight of many Romans is to
find something old&mdash;the older the
better. They live so much in the
past that they follow with an eager
interest the various steps taken to
enlighten them on the lives and
deeds of the men of old, their ancestors
on the soil and in the faith
which they profess.</p>

<p>Foremost in the pursuit and discovery
of Christian antiquities
stands the Commendatore de Rossi.
It has been said that poets are born,
not made: De Rossi’s ability as a
Christian archæologist seems to be
more the gift of nature than the
result of study. With unwearied
industry, with profound knowledge,
with an almost unerring judgment,
he finds out and illustrates the remains
of Christian antiquity scattered
around Rome&mdash;not on the
surface, but in the deeps of the
earth. The latest and one of the
most important discoveries he has
made forms the subject of the present
paper.</p>

<p>Tor Marancia is a name not much
known out of Rome, yet it designates
a place which was of some
importance in its day. The traveller
who contemplates the works of
ancient art collected in the Vatican
Museum cannot fail to be interested
in two very beautiful black and
white mosaics which form the floor
of the gallery known as the Braccio
Nuovo. Mythological fables and
Homeric legends are represented
in these pavements, and they come
from Tor Marancia. In the Gallery
of the Candelabra, and in the
library of the same museum, a collection
of frescos, busts, statues, and
mosaics of excellent workmanship
and of great interest, likewise discovered
at Tor Marancia, are exhibited.
All these objects were
found at that place in the course
of excavations made there in the
reign of Pope Pius VI. In ancient
times a villa stood at Tor Marancia,
of which these formed the decorations.</p>

<p>At this spot also is found the entrance
to a very extensive catacomb
which contains three floors,
and diverges in long, winding ways
under the soil of the Campagna.
The catacomb has been called by
the name of S. Domitilla, on evidence
found during the excavations
made there. This lady was a
member of the Flavian family, which
gave three occupants to the imperial
throne&mdash;Vespasian, Titus, and
Domitian. It is a well-known fact
that those early Christians who
were blessed with wealth were in
the habit of interring the bodies of
their brethren, of saints, and of martyrs
within the enclosure of their
villas. Such villas were situated
outside the limits of the city; and
hence we find the entrance to every
catacomb beyond the city walls,
with the solitary exception of the
catacomb or grottos of the Vatican,
and the entrances to all of
them are found in sites ascertained
to have been the property of Christians.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
It might be easy to multiply
instances of this, taking the
facts from the <cite>Acts of the Martyrs,</cite>
wherein the places of sepulture are
indicated, and the names of those
who bestowed the last rites upon
the dead recorded.</p>

<p>Domitilla, or Flavia Domitilla,
as she is sometimes termed, was a
niece of the consul Flavius Clemens,
who was cousin of the Emperor
Domitian. She was a Christian,
having been baptized by S. Peter;
and, after a life spent in charitable
works, amongst which was the burial
of the martyrs “in a catacomb
near the Ardeatine Way,” the same
of which we write, she also suffered
martyrdom. Her two servants,
Nereus and Achilleus, were put to
death previously, and their bodies
were placed in this catacomb by
Domitilla.</p>

<p>In 1854, while De Rossi was pursuing
his researches in the catacomb
of S. Domitilla, he came upon the
foundations of a building which
pierced the second floor of the subterranean
cemetery. This was a
most unusual occurrence, and the
eminent archæologist eagerly followed
up his discovery. He found
a marble slab which recorded the
giving up of a space for burial “Ex
indulgentia Flaviæ Domitillæ”&mdash;a
confirmation of the proprietorship
of the place.</p>

<p>De Rossi naturally concluded
that the building thus incorporated
in the Christian cemetery was of
great importance. The <i lang="la">loculi</i>, or
resting-places of the dead, were
very large, which indicates great
antiquity; the inscriptions likewise
were of a very early date; and <i lang="la">sarcophagi</i>
adorned with lions’ heads,
marble columns overturned, and
other signs, led the discoverer to
the conclusion that he had come
upon the foundations of a church
constructed within this cemetery.
In the course of his excavations he
had penetrated into the open air,
and found himself in a hollow depression
formed by the falling in
of the surface. Amongst other objects
discovered were four marble
slabs containing epitaphs furnished
with consular dates of the years
335, 380, 399, and 406; and also a
form of contract by which the right
of burial in the edifice was sold.
The proprietor of the land above
the cemetery opposed the continuance
of the excavations, and the
discoverer, obliged to withdraw,
covered up the materials already
found with earth, and turned his
attention to other recently-discovered
objects in another place.</p>

<p>Twenty years after, in 1874, Monsignor
de Merode purchased the
land overlying the catacomb and
church, and the excavations were
again undertaken under most favorable
circumstances. In vain did the
Commission of Sacred Archæology,
under De Rossi’s guidance, seek
for the four marble columns and
the two beautiful <i lang="la">sarcophagi</i> that
had been seen there twenty years
before. The proprietor is supposed
to have carried them away.
But they found instead the floor of
the church or basilica, with its
three naves, the bases of the four
columns, the apse, the place where
the altar stood, and the space occupied
by the episcopal chair behind
the altar. The basilica is as large
as that of San Lorenzo beyond the
walls. The left aisle is sixty feet
long by thirteen broad; the central
nave is twenty-four feet broad; and
the right aisle, which is not yet entirely
unearthed, is considered to
be of the same breadth as the first
mentioned; the greatest depth of
the apse is fifteen feet. “The
church,” says De Rossi, “is of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
gigantic proportions for an edifice
constructed in the bowels of the
earth and at the deep level of the
second floor of a subterranean
cemetery.”</p>

<p>Here, then, was a basilica or
church discovered in the midst of
a catacomb. That the latter belonged
to Flavia Domitilla was
well known; and yet another proof,
which illustrates archæological difficulties
and the method of overcoming
them, was found here. It
was a broken slab of marble containing
a portion of an inscription:</p>

<p class="center monospace">......RVM<br />
.....ORVM<br />
(*)</p>

<p class="noindent">and having the image of an anchor
at the point(*). It was concluded
that the anchor was placed at an
equal distance from both ends of
the inscription, and the discoverer,
with the knowledge he already has
of the place, supplied the letters
which he considered wanting to
the completion of the inscription,
and thus produced the words,</p>

<p class="center monospace">SEPVLCRVM<br />
FLAVIORVM<br />
*</p>

<p class="noindent">(sepulchre of the Flavii). This
reading is very probably the right
one, and its probability is greatly
strengthened by the position of
the anchor, since the full inscription,
as here shown, leaves that
sign still in the centre.</p>

<p>But to find the name borne by
these ruins when the building of
which they are the sole remnants
was fresh and new presented a
task to their discoverer. It was necessary
to seek in ancient works&mdash;pontifical
books and codices&mdash;for
some account of a basilica on the
Ardeatine Way. In the life of S.
Gregory the Great it is related that
this pontiff delivered one of his
homilies “in the cemetery of S.
Domitilla on the Ardeatine Way, at
the Church of S. Petronilla.” The
pontifical books and codices, although
they differ in details&mdash;some
saying in the cemetery of Domitilla,
and others in that of Nereus and
Archilleus, which is the same place
under another name&mdash;agree in the
principal fact. On the small remnant
of plaster remaining on the
wall of the apse an unskilled hand
had traced a <i lang="it">graffito</i>, or drawing
scratched on the plaster with a
pointed instrument, somewhat resembling
those found on the walls
of Pompeii. This <i lang="it">graffito</i> represents
a bishop, vested in episcopal robes,
seated in a chair, in the act of
delivering a discourse. This rude
sketch of a bishop so occupied, taken
in conjunction with the fact
that S. Gregory did here deliver
one of his homilies, is a link in
the chain of evidence which identifies
the ruin with the ancient basilica
of S. Petronilla.</p>

<p>But a still more convincing testimony
was forthcoming. A large
fragment of marble, containing a
portion of what appeared to have
been a long inscription, was found
in the apse. There were but few
complete words in this fragment,
and these were chiefly the termination
of lines in what seemed to have
been a metrical composition. Odd
words, selected at random from a
poem, standing alone, devoid of
preceding or succeeding words,
might not seem to furnish very rich
materials even to an archæologist.
These wandering words were, however,
recognized to be the terminal
words of a poem or eulogium written
by Pope Damasus in honor of
the martyrs Nereus and Achilleus.
Now the connection between this
metrical eulogium and the basilica
was to be sought for. In the Einsiedeln
Codex the place where this
poem was to be seen is stated to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
have been the sepulchre of SS.
Nereus and Achilleus, on the Appian
Way, at S. Petronilla. The
poem, or rather this fragment of it,
being found at this sepulchre, it
was natural to conclude that the
church was that of S. Petronilla.
The Appian Way is the great high-road
from which the Ardeatine Way
branches off near this spot.</p>

<p>Again, the basilica of S. Petronilla
was frequented by pilgrims
from many nations in the VIIth
century. Among these were Gauls,
Germans, and Britons. In their
itineraries of the martyrs’ sepulchres
in Rome, and in the collection of
the metrical epigraphs written at
these places, it is proved that the
original name of this church was
that of S. Petronilla. “Near the
Ardeatine Way is the Church of S.
Petronilla,” say these old documents,
and they likewise inform
us that S. Nereus and S. Achilleus
and S. Petronilla herself are buried
there: “Juxta viam Ardeatinam
ecclesia est S. Petronillæ; ibi
quoque S. Nereus et S. Achilleus
sunt et ipsa Petronilla sepulti.”</p>

<p>A second fragment of the slab
containing the metrical composition
of Pope Damasus has since been
found, and this goes to confirm the
testimony furnished by the former
fragment. In the following copy
of the inscription the capital letters
on the right-hand side are those on
the fragment first discovered; those
on the left belong to the recently-discovered
portion:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse center">“<span class="smcap">Nereus et Achilleus Martyres</span>.</div>
</div>

<div class="verse">CREDITe per Damasum possit quid GLORIA</div>
<div class="verse">CHRISTI.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The date of the church was likewise
ascertained. It is known that
Pope Damasus, the great preserver
of the martyrs’ graves, would never
allow the Christian cemeteries to be
disturbed for the purpose of building
a church therein; and although
he himself strongly desired that his
remains should repose in one of
these sacred places by the side of
his predecessors, he abandoned
this desire rather than remove the
sacred ashes of the dead. It may
naturally be concluded, then, that
this church was built after his day&mdash;he
died in 384&mdash;as were the
churches of S. Agnes, S. Lawrence,
and S. Alexander, all of which are
beyond the city walls and built in
catacombs. The catacombs under
the Church of S. Petronilla showed
an inscription bearing the date of
390, and in the church itself a monumental
slab with the date of 395
has been found. It is thus almost
certain that between the highest
date found <em>under</em>, and the lowest
date found <em>in</em>, the church&mdash;that is,
between the years 390 and 395&mdash;the
basilica of S. Petronilla was constructed.</p>

<p>For about three centuries and a
half this church was well frequented.
We have records of gifts sent
to it, precious vestments, etc., by
Pope Gregory III., who reigned
from 715 to 741. But in 755 the
Longobards came down upon
Rome; they desecrated the churches
and cemeteries around the city,
and then began the siege of Rome.
After peace was made, the pontiff
of the period, Paul I., transferred
the relics and remains of the saints
to safer custody, and the Church
of S. Petronilla became deserted.
From unmistakable signs it seems
that this desertion was conducted in
a most regular manner, and that it
was closed and despoiled of its precious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
objects. The door which entered
the left aisle was found walled
up; the altar, the seats of the choir,
the episcopal chair, and the ambons
or marble pulpits ware all
removed and transported elsewhere.
The floor of the church, so
far below the level of the surrounding
soil, formed a resting-place for
the water which drained through
the neighboring lands after rains
had fallen, and this undoubtedly
formed the strongest reason for the
abandonment of S. Petronilla. Nothing
was left in it but <i lang="la">sarcophagi</i>
and sepulchres, the pavements
with their marble epitaphs&mdash;so valuable
to-day in revealing history&mdash;some
columns with their beautifully-carved
capitals, which time or
an earthquake has overturned and
hidden within the dark bosom of
the earth for more than a thousand
years.</p>

<p>The hundred pilgrims who came
from America, with a hundred new-found
friends, assembled on the
14th of June, 1874, to pray in that
disentombed old church. They
had come from a world unknown
and undreamt of by the pilgrims
who had formerly knelt within
these walls; and as they looked
around on the wide and desolate
Campagna, and on the monument
of Cecilia Metella shining in the
distance white and perfect, in spite
of the nineteen centuries that have
passed away since it received its
inmate, and at the blue, changeless
sky overhead, and then turned
their eyes upon the church, decorated
that morning with festoons of
green branches and gay flowers,
the same as it may have been on
other festive occasions a thousand
years ago, they may have felt that
time has effected almost as little
change in the works of man as in
those of nature, and that all things
in Rome partake of Rome’s eternity.</p>

<p><cite>Le Culte Catholique</cite> is another valuable
addition to controversial literature, by
the author of <cite>The Bible and the Rule of
Faith</cite>.</p>

<p>It is true that the days of controversy
seem to be drawing to a close. The
Greek schism still holds itself aloof in
sullen isolation; but the controversy is
exhausted, and all that is left of a church
has become the mere unfruitful appanage
of a northern despotism.</p>

<p>As to Protestantism, it never had any
positive existence as a confession. Three
hundred years have exhausted its theological
pretensions. As a religion it has
ceased to exist, and it lies buried beneath
the weight of its own negations. The
only formidable enemies of the church
now are the disowners both of Christ and
God, and they seek her destruction because
they know that she alone offers an
insuperable obstacle to the universal
atheism which they hope to bring about.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances works like
Dr. Bégin’s are chiefly useful for the information
of Catholics, and for the support
they render to their faith.</p>

<p><cite>Le Culte Catholique</cite> is, the writer tells us,
“an exposition of the faith of the Roman
Church in the matters of the worship of
the saints and of their relics, of the blessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
Virgin Mary, of images, etc., in reply
to the objections of Protestantism, followed
by a historical and critical dissertation
on the celibacy of the clergy.”
On these trite subjects little that is new
can be said. But the work before us is
a terse and lucid summary of Catholic
teaching on the above points.</p>

<p>It is the object of the society of Freemasons
to effect the universal deification, the
rejection, that is, of the belief in any existence
higher than the human being, and in
any superiority of one man over another.
For this they find it convenient to support
the foolish Protestant objection to a
splendid ritual and costly churches, on
the ground that “God is a spirit, and
they that worship him must worship him
in spirit and in truth.” Dr. Bégin quotes
the following telling passage from a contemporary
writer in answer to this frivolous
objection:</p>

<p>“I know the old tirades about the temple
of nature. No doubt the starry vault
of heaven is a sublime dome; but no
worship exists which is celebrated in the
open air. A special place of meeting is
required for collective adoration, because
our religious sociability urges us to gather
together for prayer, as it were to make
a common stock of our joys and griefs.
Besides, should the time come when we
shall have nothing but the cupola of
heaven to shelter our religious assemblies,
it would require a considerable
amount of courage to betake ourselves
thither, especially in winter. And the
philosophers who find our cathedrals so
damp would not be the most intrepid
against the inclemency of the sanctuary
of nature. Thus do great errors touch
on the ridiculous. Reasoning begins
their refutation; a smile ends it.”</p>

<p>The second chapter is an admirable exposition
of the special worship (<i lang="la">hyperdulia</i>)
paid to the Blessed Virgin Mary, in
the course of which he shows triumphantly
that the definition of her Immaculate
Conception was no new doctrine, but
a mere definite and dogmatic statement
of a doctrine which had been all along
held implicitly in the church. The following
simile, illustrative of this argument,
appears to us to be worth quoting:
“Modern science, which is daily making
such extraordinary progress, discovers,
ever and anon, fresh stars, which seem to
float in the most distant depths of space,
which become more bright as they are
more attentively observed, and which end
by becoming stars of continually-increasing
splendor. These stars are not of recent
date; they are not new; they are
only perceived. Something analogous
takes place in the heavens of the church
on the subject of certain truths of our
faith. Their light reveals itself and develops
by degrees. Sometimes the shock
of controversy illuminates them. Then
comes a definition to invest them with
fresh splendor. But in receiving this
supplement of light, destined to make
them better understood by the faithful,
they lose nothing of their proper nature;
their essence is not in the slightest degree
changed; only our minds appropriate
them with more facility.”</p>

</div>

<p>To those who have attempted to form
an adequate conception of the charitable
and ascetic spirit, the simple record of
these saintly lives must have a wonderful
fascination. To those, even, who are
wholly absorbed in a life of pleasure it
will at least possess the merit of a new
sensation, if they can forget the silent reproof
which such examples convey.</p>

<p>It affords matter of encouragement in
these days of combined luxury and destitution
to look over the history of those&mdash;many
of whom were delicately reared&mdash;who
left all for God, content to do whatsoever
he appointed them to do, and to
submit to extraordinary mortifications
for his sake. The work embraces six
brief biographies of Visitation Nuns eminent
for their self-sacrificing labors for
the moral and intellectual education of
their charges, and in other good and
charitable offices. Their names, even,
may be quite new to English-speaking
readers, but that fact is all the more in
keeping with their hidden lives. We have
said enough to indicate the general character
of the volume.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Dorrien</span>: A novel. By Julia
Kavanagh. New York: D. Appleton
&amp; Co. 1875.</p>

</div>

<p>The writer succeeds, in the very opening
chapter, in so portraying the character
of a child as to make it a living
breathing reality to the reader. The story
of his humble life in childhood and his
struggles and trials in later years is told
without any attempt at fine writing&mdash;indeed,
all the characters are simply and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
well drawn, and retain their individuality
to the end. The heroine, neglected in
childhood, and without any guide in matters
of faith, is easily persuaded by a
suitor that religion is contrary to reason;
and thus, left to her own unaided judgment,
and notwithstanding her innate love
of truth, soon finds herself entangled in a
web of deceit and hypocrisy. She only
escapes the unhappiness which such a
course entails by forsaking it.</p>

<p>The moral of the tale (if that is not an
obsolete term) is what the reader would
naturally infer&mdash;the necessity of early religious
instruction, and the advantage,
even in this life, of a belief in revealed
truth. We are glad to note the absence
of the faults which disfigure much of the
imaginative literature of the day, not excepting,
we are sorry to say, that which
emanates from the writer’s own sex. We
see no attempt to give false views of life,
or to undermine the moral and religious
principles of the reader; on the contrary,
there is reason to infer much that is positively
good, though not so definitely
stated as we should have liked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Bible and the Rule of Faith.</span>
By the Abbé Louis-Nazaire Bégin,
Doctor of Theology, Theological Professor
in the University of Laval.
Translated from the French by G. M.
Ward [Mrs. Pennée].</p>

</div>

<p>Protestantism is well-nigh defunct. It
is in its last throes. It has not sufficient
vitality left to care for its own doctrines,
such as they are. As a religion it has
almost ceased to exist. Disobedience to
the faith has been succeeded by indifference;
indifference by the hatred of Christ.
Its rickety old doctrines, whose folly has
been exposed over and over again thousands
of times, have quietly tumbled out
of existence. Protestants themselves
have almost forgotten them, and certainly
do not care enough about them to defend
them. Paganism has returned&mdash;paganism
in its last stage of sceptical development.
We have to contend now for the
divinity of Christ and the existence of a
God. The Bible and the rule of faith are
up amongst the lumber.</p>

<p>Yet it may be&mdash;as the writer of this
work asserts; we much doubt it, however&mdash;that
there are still “many poor souls in
the bosom of Protestantism a prey to the
anguish of doubt.” To such the Abbé Bégin’s
treatise on the rule of faith may be
of the utmost service. The argument is
extremely terse and lucid. In short, were
the minds of Protestant fanatics open to
reason, it could not fail to convince them
of the unreasoning folly of their notions
about the Bible being the one only rule of
faith.</p>

<p>The first part of this work treats of the
rule of faith in general, and proves,
amongst other things, that such a rule
must be sure, efficient, and perpetual to
put an end to controversies.</p>

<p>The second part exhibits the logical
impossibility of the Protestant rule of
faith, remote and proximate. That is to
say, that it is impossible for the unexplained
text of the Bible to be a sure, efficient,
and perpetual rule of faith, and for
an immediate inspiration of its meaning
to individuals by the Holy Ghost to be its
means of explanation.</p>

<p>The third part proves very exhaustively
that the Catholic rule of faith is the only
possible sure, efficient, and perpetual
one; namely, Holy Scripture, the remote
rule, and the teaching church, the proximate
one.</p>

<p>To any souls “in the bosom of Protestism”
who are “a prey to the anguish of
doubt,” if indeed there be such, we cordially
recommend this treatise. Its tone
is kind and gentle, its reasoning irresistible,
and, with the blessing of God, is
able to put an end to all their doubts on
the fundamental question as to the true
rule of faith.</p>

dear to certain hearts, of a peep behind
the scenes of a royal household. Never
having been married, she had plenty of
time for jotting down her notes and observations
on men, women, and things.
Many of the men and women she met

much nonsense in her observations,
mingled with pleasant glimpses of a kind
of life that has now passed away. Mr.

<h3>MR. GLADSTONE AND MARYLAND TOLERATION.</h3>

<p>It was supposed that Mr. Gladstone
had been so triumphantly refuted,
as a polemic, that he would
take a prudent refuge in silence.
At a moment when neighboring nations
were rent with religious dissensions,
and when England needed
repose from, rather than fuel
added to, her internal agitations, a
statesman and ex-premier of the
British Empire assumes the <i lang="fr">rôle</i>
of a religious agitator and accuser,
and startles, as well as offends, the
public sense of appropriateness by
his useless and baseless indictment
against the Catholic Church, to
which England owes all that is glorious
in her constitution and in her
history; against English Catholics
in particular, his fellow-subjects,
who of all others, by their loyalty
and Christian faith and virtues, can
preserve the liberties and the institutions
of their country, now threatened
alike by infidel corruption,
Protestant indifference, and communistic
malice; and against that
saintly and illustrious pontiff whose
hand is only raised to bless, whose
lips breathe unfaltering prayer, and
whose voice and pen have never
ceased to announce and defend the
eternal truths of religion, to uphold
morality, and to refute the crying
errors and evils of our times. The
unanswerable refutations which Mr.
Gladstone’s attacks elicited from
Cardinal Manning, Bishops Ullathorne
and Vaughan, Drs. Newman
and Capel, and Canon Neville, not
to speak of the Italian work of
Mgr. Nardi and the rebukes administered
by the periodical press,
had, it was believed, even by impartial
Protestants, effectually driven
this new champion of the old
No-popery party in England from
the field of polemics. But, like all
new recruits, the ex-premier seems
incapable of realizing defeat, or
perhaps is anxious, at least, to retire
with the honors of war.</p>

<p>Not content with the serial publication
of his three tracts, he has
just now republished them in one
volume, with a <cite>Preface</cite>, under the
title of <cite>Rome and the Newest Fashions
in Religion</cite>&mdash;a title as unbecoming
the gravity of his subjects as it
is unsupported by the contents of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
the work. The preface to the republication
not only reiterates his
accusations on all points, but the
author, not satisfied with his new
part as theologian, essays the <i lang="fr">rôle</i>
of historical critic, and thus gives
prominence to a historical question
of deep interest and of especial
importance to the Catholics of this
country.</p>

<p>The same <i lang="la">animus</i> which inspired
Mr. Gladstone’s attacks against the
church, against his Catholic fellow-countrymen,
and against the most
august and venerable personage in
Christendom, has also induced him
to deny to the Catholic founders of
Maryland the honorable renown,
accorded to them heretofore by
historians with singular unanimity,
of having, when in power, practised
religious toleration towards
all Christian sects, and secured
freedom of conscience, not only by
their unwavering action and practice,
but also by giving it the stability
and sanctions of statute law.
This is certainly the only phase in
this celebrated controversy upon
which it remains for Mr. Gladstone
to be answered.</p>

<p>His Eminence Cardinal Manning,
in <cite>The Vatican Decrees in their
bearing on Civil Allegiance</cite>, at page
88 (New York edition), writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For the same reasons I deplore the
haste, I must say the passion, which carried
away so large a mind to affirm or to
imply that the church of this day would,
if she could, use torture, and force, and
coercion in matters of religious belief.…
In the year 1830 the Catholics
of Belgium were in a vast majority, but
they did not use their political power to
constrain the faith or conscience of any
man. The ‘Four Liberties’ of Belgium
were the work of Catholics. This is the
most recent example of what Catholics
would do if they were in possession of
power. But there is one more ancient
and more homely for us Englishmen. It
is found at a date when the old traditions
of the Catholic Church were still vigorous
in the minds of men.… If the
modern spirit had any share in producing
the constitution of Belgium, it certainly
had no share in producing the constitution
of Maryland. Lord Baltimore, who
had been Secretary of State under James
I., in 1633 emigrated to the American
plantations, where, through Lord Stafford’s
influence, he had obtained a grant
of land.… They named their new
country Maryland, and there they settled.
The oath of the governor was in these
terms: ‘I will not, by myself or any
other, directly or indirectly, molest any
person professing to believe in Jesus
Christ, for or in respect of religion.’
Lord Baltimore invited the Puritans of
Massachusetts&mdash;who, like himself, had
renounced their country for conscience’
sake&mdash;to come into Maryland. In 1649,
when active persecution had sprung up
again in England, the Council of Maryland,
on the 21st of April, passed this
statute; ‘And whereas the forcing of the
conscience in matters of religion hath
frequently fallen out to be of dangerous
consequence in the commonwealth where
it has been practised, and for the more
quiet and peaceable government of the
province, and the better to preserve mutual
love and amity among the inhabitants,
no person within the province
professing to believe in Jesus Christ
shall be anyways troubled, molested, or
discountenanced for his or her religion,
or in the free exercise thereof.’ The
Episcopalians and Protestants fled from
Virginia into Maryland. Such was the
commonwealth founded by a Catholic
upon the broad moral law I have here
laid down&mdash;that faith is an act of the
will, and that to force men to profess
what they do not believe is contrary to
the law of God, and that to generate faith
by force is morally impossible.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Gladstone, in his <cite>Vaticanism</cite>,
page 96, replies to the above as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It appears to me that Archbishop
Manning has completely misapprehended
the history of the settlement of Maryland
and the establishment of toleration
there for all believers in the Holy Trinity.
It was a wise measure, for which the
two Lords Baltimore, father and son, deserve
the highest honor. But the measure
was really defensive; and its main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
and very legitimate purpose plainly was
to secure the free exercise of the Roman
Catholic religion. Immigration into the
colony was by the charter free; and only
by this and other popular provisions
could the territory have been extricated
from the grasp of its neighbors in Virginia,
who claimed it as their own. It
was apprehended that the Puritans would
flood it, as they did; and it seemed certain
that but for this excellent provision
the handful of Roman Catholic founders
would have been unable to hold their
ground. The facts are given in Bancroft’s
<cite>History of the United States</cite>, vol. i.,
chap. vii.”</p>

</div>

<p>Again, in his <cite>Preface</cite> to <cite>Rome and
the Newest Fashions in Religion</cite>, page
viii., Mr. Gladstone writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It has long been customary to quote
the case of Maryland in proof that, more
than two centuries ago, the Roman Catholic
Church, where power was in its
hands, could use it for the purposes of
toleration. Archbishop Manning has repeated
the boast, and with very large exaggeration.</p>

<p>“I have already shown from Bancroft’s
<cite>History</cite> that in the case of Maryland
there was no question of a merciful use
of power towards others, but simply of a
wise and defensive prudence with respect
to themselves&mdash;that is to say, so far as
the tolerant legislation of the colony was
the work of Roman Catholics. But it
does not appear to have been their work.
By the fourth article of the charter we
find that no church could be consecrated
there except according to the laws of the
church at home. The tenth article guaranteed
to the colonists generally ‘all privileges,
franchises, and liberties of this our
kingdom of England.’ It was in 1649 that
the Maryland Act of Toleration was passed,
which, however, prescribed the punishment
of death for any one who denied the
Trinity. Of the small legislative body
which passed it, two-thirds appear to have
been Protestant, the recorded numbers
being sixteen and eight respectively. The
colony was open to the immigration of
Puritans and all Protestants, and any
permanent and successful oppression by
a handful of Roman Catholics was altogether
impossible. But the colonial act
seems to have been an echo of the order
of the House of Commons at home, on
the 27th of October, 1645, that the inhabitants
of the Summer Islands, and such
others as shall join themselves to them,
‘shall without any molestation or trouble
have and enjoy the liberty of their consciences
in matters of God’s worship’;
and of a British ordinance of 1647.</p>

<p>“Upon the whole, then, the picture of
Maryland legislation is a gratifying one;
but the historic theory which assigns the
credit of it to the Roman Church has little
foundation in fact.”</p>

</div>

<p>Let us first test Mr. Gladstone’s
accuracy and consistency as a historical
critic. He begins by alleging
that the Maryland Toleration
Act was a measure of defensive prudence
in the interests of the Catholics
themselves, and that “its main
and very legitimate purpose plainly
was to secure the free exercise of
the Roman Catholic religion.” He
then asserts that this act of toleration
was not the work of the Catholics
at all, but of a Protestant majority
in the legislature which passed
it. We have, then, here presented
the extraordinary picture of an alleged
Protestant legislature passing
a law which was really intended to
protect Catholics against Protestant
ascendency and apprehended
Protestant persecution, and whose
“main and very legitimate purpose
was to secure the free exercise
of the Roman Catholic religion.”
Surely, the Protestants of that day
were liberal and generous, especially
as it was an age of persecution,
when not only were Catholics hunted
down both in England and her
Virginia and New England colonies,
but even Protestants of different
sects were relentlessly persecuting
each other. And in what proper
sense can <em>they</em> be said to have been
Protestants with whom it was “<em>a
very legitimate purpose</em>” to legislate
in the express interests of Roman
Catholics?</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone also states that
the Toleration Act was passed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
the apprehension of an influx of
Puritans, and to protect the colony
“from the grasp of its neighbors
in Virginia”; whereas his favorite
author, Mr. Bancroft, informs Mr.
Gladstone that Lord Baltimore invited
both the Episcopalians of
Virginia and the Puritans of New
England into his domains, offering
a gift of lands as an inducement;
and it is a historical fact that numbers
of them accepted the invitation.</p>

<p>Again, Mr. Gladstone, while apparently
treating the Toleration
Act as a Catholic measure, animadverts
with evident disapproval
on that feature in it which “prescribed
the punishment of death
for any one who denied the Trinity,”
and then immediately he claims
that the legislature which passed
the act was a Protestant body&mdash;“two-thirds,”
he writes, “appear
to have been Protestants”&mdash;thus
imposing upon his Protestant friends
the odium of inflicting death for
the exercise of conscience and religious
belief; and that, too, not
upon Papists, as they were not included
in the punishment.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone, in <cite>The Vatican
Decrees in their bearing on Civil Allegiance</cite>
(page 83), expressing no
doubt the common sentiments of
Protestants since the time of Luther
and Henry VIII., uses these irreverent
words in regard to the Blessed
Virgin Mary, that peerless and immaculate
Lady whom four-fifths of
the Christian world venerate as the
Mother of God:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The sinlessness of the Virgin Mary
and the personal infallibility of the Pope
are the characteristic dogmas of modern
Romanism.… Both rest on pious fiction
and fraud; both present a refined
idolatry by clothing a pure humble woman
and a mortal sinful man with divine
attributes. The dogma of the Immaculate
Conception, which exempts the Virgin
Mary from sin and guilt, perverts
Christianism into Marianism.… The
worship of a woman is virtually substituted
for the worship of Christ.”</p>

</div>

<p>And yet with such sentiments,
in which doubtless the Protestants
of Maryland in 1649 concurred, he
attributes to, and claims for, those
Protestants who, he says, constituted
two-thirds of the Maryland
Colonial Legislature in 1649, the
passage of a law which enacted
“that whosoever shall use or utter
any reproachful words or speeches
concerning the Blessed Virgin Mary,
the Mother of our Saviour, … shall
for the first offence forfeit five
pounds sterling, or, if not able to
pay, be publicly whipped and imprisoned
during pleasure, etc.; for
the second offence, ten pounds, etc.;
and for the third shall forfeit all his
lands and goods, and be banished
from the province.”</p>

<p>The following anecdote, related
by the Protestant Bozman,<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> is quite
pertinent to our subject and to our
cause:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And in the time of the Long Parliament
when the differences between the Lord
Baltimore and Colonell Samuel Matthews,
as agent for the colony of Virginia, were
depending before a committee of that
parliament for the navy, that clause in the
sayd law, concerning the Virgin Mary,
was at that committee objected as an exception
against his lordship; whereupon
a worthy member of the sayd committee
stood up and sayd, that he wondered
that any such exception should be taken
against his lordship; for (says hee) doth
not the Scripture say, that all generations
shall call her blessed? (The author here
cites in the margin, ‘Lu. i. 48.’) And the
committee insisted no more on that exception.”</p>

</div>

<p>The authorities relied upon by
Mr. Gladstone, besides Bancroft,
whom we shall presently refer to,
are <cite>Maryland Toleration</cite>, by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
Rev. Ethan Allen, and <cite>Maryland
not a Catholic Colony</cite>, by E. D. N.
The former is a pamphlet of sixty-four
pages addressed by the author,
a Protestant minister, to his brethren
in the ministry in 1855, is
purely a sectarian tract, hostile to
every Catholic view and interest,
and partisan in spirit and in
matter. The latter is a few pages
of printed matter, consisting of
three newspaper articles published
last year in the <cite>Daily Pioneer</cite> of St.
Paul, Minnesota, and recently reprinted
in the <cite>North-Western Chronicle</cite>
of the same place, the editor of
which states that the author of the
letters is the Rev. Edward D.
Neill, also a Protestant minister,
and president of Macalester College.
The letters of “E. D. N.”
were sharply and ably replied to by
Mr. William Markoe, formerly an
Episcopal minister, now a member
of the Catholic Church. The letters
of “E. D. N.” are more sectarian
than historical, and cannot be
quoted in a controversy in which
such names as Chalmers, Bancroft,
McSherry, Bozman, etc., figure.
The attack of “E. D. N.” on the
personal character of Lord Baltimore
is enough to condemn his effort.</p>

<p>But Mr. Gladstone’s principal
author is Bancroft, from whose
pages he claims to have shown that
“in the case of Maryland there was
<em>no question</em> of a merciful use of
power towards others, but <em>simply</em> of
a wise and defensive prudence with
respect to themselves.” Motives
of <em>self-interest</em> are thus substituted
for those of <em>benevolence</em> and <em>mercy</em>.
If this were correctly stated, why
does Mr. Gladstone state that the
Act of Toleration was a measure
“for which the two Lords Baltimore,
father and son, deserve the
highest honor”? But our task is
now to inquire how far his author
sustains Mr. Gladstone in denying
to the Catholics of Maryland, who
enacted religious toleration, all motives
of benevolence and mercy.</p>

<p>Mr. Bancroft, on the contrary,
asserts that the “new government
[of Maryland] was erected on a
<em>foundation</em> as extraordinary as its
results were <em>benevolent</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> In speaking
of Lord Baltimore, the founder
of Maryland, its chief statesman
and law-giver, he extols his <em>moderation</em>,
<em>sincerity of character</em>, and <em>disinterestedness</em>,<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
and proceeds to
say:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Calvert deserves to be ranked among
the most wise and <em>benevolent</em> law-givers
of all ages. He was the first in the history
of the Christian world to seek for religious
security and peace by the practice
of justice, and not by the exercise of power;
to plan the establishment of popular
institutions with the enjoyment of liberty
of conscience; to advance the career of civilization
by recognizing the rightful equality
of all Christian sects. The asylum of
Papists was the spot where, in a remote
corner of the world, on the banks of rivers
which, as yet, had hardly been explored,
the <em>mild forbearance</em> of a proprietary
adopted religious freedom as the <em>basis</em> of
the state.”<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Referring to the act of taking
possession of their new homes in
Maryland by the Catholic pilgrims,
the same author says, thereby “religious
liberty obtained a home, its
only home in the wide world, at the
humble village which bore the name
of St. Mary’s.”<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> And speaking of
the progress of the colony, he further
says: “Under the <em>mild</em> institutions
and munificence of Baltimore
the dreary wilderness soon bloomed
with swarming life and activity
of prosperous settlements; the Roman
Catholics who were oppressed
by the laws of England were sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
to find a peaceful asylum in the
quiet harbors of the Chesapeake;
and there, too, Protestants were
sheltered against Protestant intolerance.”<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
Such, in fine, is the repeated
language of an author
whom Mr. Gladstone refers to in
proof of his assertion that toleration
in Maryland was <em>simply</em> a measure
of self-defence.</p>

<p>Chalmers bears the following testimony
to the same point: “He”
(Lord Baltimore) “<em>laid the foundation</em>
of his province upon the broad
<em>basis</em> of security to property and of
freedom of religion, granting, in absolute
fee, fifty acres of land to
every emigrant; establishing Christianity
according to the old common
law, of which it is a part, without
allowing pre-eminence to any
particular sect. The wisdom of his
choice soon converted a dreary
wilderness into a prosperous colony.”<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>And Judge Story, with the history
of the colony from its beginning
and the charter before him, adds
the weight of judicial approval in
the following words: “It is certainly
very honorable to the liberality
and public spirit of the proprietary
that he should have introduced into
his <em>fundamental</em> policy the doctrine
of general toleration and equality
among Christian sects (for he does
not appear to have gone further),
and have thus given the earliest example
of a legislator inviting his
subjects to the free indulgence of
religious opinion. This was anterior
to the settlement of Rhode
Island, and therefore merits the
enviable rank of being the first
recognition among the colonists of
the glorious and indefeasible rights
of conscience.”<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>But there is another view, clearly
sustained by an important and certain
chain of facts, which has never
occurred to the historical writers
on Maryland toleration, at least in
this connection, though they give
the facts upon which the view is
based, and which wholly destroys
the theory of Mr. Gladstone and
his authorities. The latter may
dispute in regard to the merits and
motives of the statute of 1649, but
they do not touch the real question.
It is an incontestable fact that the
religious toleration which historians
have so much extolled in the
Catholic colonists and founders of
Maryland did not originate with,
or derive its existence from, that
law of 1649, but, on the contrary, it
existed long anterior to, and independent
of, it. This great feature
in the Catholic government of
Maryland had been established by
the Catholic lord-proprietary, his
lieutenant-governor, agents, and
colonists, and faithfully practised
for fifteen years prior to the Toleration
Act of 1649. From 1634 to
1649 it had been enforced with unwavering
firmness and protected
with exalted benevolence. This
important fact is utterly ignored by
Mr. Gladstone and his authors, the
Rev. Ethan Allen and the Rev. Edward
D. Neill, but the facts related
by Bancroft, and indeed by all historians,
prove it beyond a question.
Bancroft records that the very
“<em>foundations</em>” of the colony were
laid upon the “<em>basis</em>” of religious
toleration, and throughout the eulogiums
pronounced by him on the
religious toleration of Maryland,
which we have quoted above, refers
entirely to the period of the
fifteen years preceding the passage
of the act of 1649. The Toleration
Act was nothing else than the declaration
of the existing state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
things and of the long and cherished
policy and practice of the colony&mdash;a
formal sanction and statutory
enactment of the existing common
law of the province.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to demonstrate
this fact, we will briefly examine
how far Mr. Bancroft sustains the
theory or views of Mr. Gladstone
in regard to the act itself. After
extolling the motives and conduct
of the Catholics of Maryland in establishing
religious toleration, as
we have remarked above, during
the fifteen years preceding the passage
of the act, Mr. Bancroft refers
to that statute in terms of highest
praise. He barely hints at the possibility
that a foresight, on the part
of the colonists, of impending dangers
to themselves from threatened
or apprehended Protestant ascendency
and persecution, might have
entered among the motives which
induced them to pass that act; but
he nowhere asserts the fact, nor
does he allege anything beyond
conjecture for the possibility of the
motive. Indeed, his mode of expressing
himself indicates that,
though he thought it possible, his
own impression was that such motive
did not suggest in part even
the passage of the act; for he
writes: “<em>As if</em>, with a foresight of
impending danger and an earnest
desire to stay its approach, the Roman
Catholics of Maryland, with
the earnest concurrence of their governor
and of the proprietary, determined
to place upon their statute-book
an act for <em>the religious freedom
which had ever been sacred on
their soil</em>.” Compare this with the
language of Mr. Gladstone, who excludes
every motive but that of
self-interest, and refers to Bancroft
in support of his view, but
does not quote his language. Mr.
Bancroft, on the other hand, after
quoting from the statute, exclaims,
such was “its sublime tenor.”</p>

<p>Mr. Griffith does not agree with
the suggestion that a sense of fear
or apprehension entered into the
motives of the Maryland lawgivers,
and says: “That this liberty did
not proceed from fear of others, on
the one hand, or licentious dispositions
in the government, on the
other, is sufficiently evident from
the penalties prescribed against
blasphemy, swearing, drunkenness,
and Sabbath-breaking, by the preceding
sections of the act, and proviso,
at the end, that such exercise
of religion did not molest or conspire
against the proprietary or his
government.”<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>Let us now proceed to examine
still further whether Maryland was
a Catholic colony, whether it was
by Catholics that religious toleration
was established there, and
whether it had its origin in the act
of 1649 or in the long previous
practice and persistent generosity
and mercy of the Catholic rulers
of the province. It is true that
while the territory afterwards granted
to Lord Baltimore was subject
to the Virginia charter, a settlement
of Episcopalians was made on
Kent Island; but they were very
few in numbers, always adhered to
Virginia rather than to Maryland
in their sympathies, were so turbulent
and disloyal that Governor
Calvert had to reduce them by
force of arms, and no one has
ever pretended that they founded a
State. We will show what relation
they had in point of numbers and
political influence to the colony,
and that they did not form even
the slightest element of power in
the founding of the province.</p>

<p>Maryland was founded alone by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
the Catholic Lord Baltimore and
his colonists. Such is the voice of
history. It is rather disingenuous
in the reverend authors of the
pamphlets mentioned by Mr. Gladstone
that upon so flimsy a circumstance
they assert that Maryland
was not settled first by Catholics.
Their voices are drowned by the
concurrent voice of tradition and
of history. It is only the reassertion
of the pretensions of these
zealous sectarians by so respectable
a person as Mr. Gladstone,
and that, too, in one of the most
remarkable controversies of the
age, that renders a recurrence to
the historical authorities and their
results at all desirable or necessary.</p>

<p>The colony of Maryland was
conceived in the spirit of liberty.
It was the flight of English Catholics
from Protestant persecution in
their native country. The state of
the penal laws in England against
Catholics at this period is too well
known. The zealous Protestant
Bozman writes that they “contained
severities enough to keep
them [the Catholics] in all due
subjection.”</p>

<p>It was at this hour of their extremest
suffering that the Catholics
of England found a friend and
leader in Sir George Calvert, who
held important trusts under the governments
of James and Charles,
and enjoyed the confidence of
his sovereigns and of his country.
“In an age when religious controversy
still continued to be active,
when increasing divisions among
Protestants were spreading a general
alarm, his mind sought relief
from controversy in the bosom of
the Roman Catholic Church, and,
preferring the avowal of his opinions
to the emoluments of office,
he resigned his place and openly
professed his conversion.”<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Even
after this he was advanced to the
peerage under the title of Lord
Baltimore&mdash;an Irish title&mdash;and was
appointed one of the principal secretaries
under James I. His positions
in the government gave him not
only an acquaintance with American
colonization, but an official connection
with it. Of these he now
availed himself to provide an asylum
abroad for his fellow-Catholics
from the relentless persecution
they were suffering at home. His
first effort was to found a Catholic
colony on the shores of Newfoundland.
A settlement was begun.
Avalon was the name it received,
and twice did Lord Baltimore
cross the ocean to visit his
cherished cradle of liberty. Baffled
by political difficulties, the
severity of the climate, and an ungenerous
soil, he abandoned the
endeavor. That his motive all
along was to found a place of refuge
for Catholics from persecution
is certain from the time and circumstances
under which the enterprise
was undertaken, as well as
from the testimony of historians.
Oldmixon says: “This gentleman
[Lord Baltimore], being of the
Romish religion, was uneasy at
home, and had the same reason to
leave the kingdom as those gentlemen
had who went to New England,
to enjoy the liberty of his
conscience.”<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Bozman writes that
“by their [the Puritans’] clamors
for a vigorous execution of the
laws against Papists, it became now
necessary for them [the Catholics]
also to look about for a place of
refuge.”<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> The same writer also
refers to a MS. in the British Museum,
written by Lord Baltimore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
himself, in which this motive is
mentioned. Driven from Avalon
by the hardness of the climate, he
visited Virginia with the same view;
but hence again he was driven
by religious bigotry and the presentation
of an anti-popery oath
from a colony “from which the
careful exclusion of Roman Catholics
had been originally avowed as
a special object.” His mind, filled
with the thought of founding a
place of refuge for Catholics, next
turned to the country beyond the
Potomac, which had been embraced
originally in the Virginia charter,
but which, upon the cancellation
of that charter, had reverted to the
crown. He obtained a grant and
charter from the king, so liberal in
its terms that, Griffith says, it became
the model for future grants.
The name was changed from Crescentia
to that of Maryland, in
honor of the Catholic queen of
Charles; but the devout Catholics
of the expedition, in their piety, extended
the term <i lang="la">Terra Mariæ</i>, the
Land of Mary, into an act of devotion
and honor to Mary, the
Queen of Heaven.</p>

<p>The first Lord Baltimore did not
live to see his project carried into
effect; he died on the 25th of
April, 1632, was succeeded by his
son Cecilius, second Lord Baltimore,
who, as Bancroft says, was
the heir of his <em>intentions</em> no less
than of his fortunes; to him was
issued the charter negotiated by
his father, bearing date the 15th of
June, 1632.</p>

<p>Founded by a Catholic, designed
as an asylum for persecuted Catholics,
is it to be supposed that Lord
Baltimore and his brother, Governor
Leonard Calvert, who organized
and led forth the pilgrims,
would be so inconsistent at this
moment of their success as to lose
sight of the main object of the
movement, and carry <em>Protestant</em>
colonists with whom to found a
<em>Catholic</em> colony? If, as Rev. Edward
D. Neill, author of <cite>Maryland
not a Catholic Colony</cite>, says, there
were only twenty Catholic gentlemen
in the ship, and three hundred
servants, mostly Protestants, would
it have been deemed necessary to
carry two Catholic priests and their
assistants along to administer to
the souls of so small a number?
In point of fact, the Protestants
were so few that they brought no
minister with them, and it was several
years before their entire numbers
justified their having either a
minister or a place of worship.
The voyage on the <i>Ark</i> and <i>Dove</i>
was more like a Catholic pilgrimage
than a secular expedition.
The principal parts of the ship
(the <i>Ark</i>), says Father White in his
<cite>Narrative</cite>, were committed to the
protection of God especially, and
to his Most Holy Mother, and S.
Ignatius, and all the guardian angels
of Maryland. The vessel was a
floating chapel, an ocean shrine of
Catholic faith and devotion, consecrated
by the unbloody sacrifice,
and resounding with Latin litanies;
its safety from many a threatened
disaster was attributed to the intercession
of the Blessed Virgin and
the saints, whose mediation was
propitiated by votive offerings promised
and promptly rendered after
their safe arrival at St. Mary’s.
The festivals of the saints were
faithfully observed throughout the
voyage, the feast of the Annunciation
of the Blessed Virgin was selected
for landing, and the solemn act
of taking possession was according
to the Catholic form. Father White
thus describes the scene:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“On the day of the Annunciation of the
Most Holy Virgin Mary (March 25), in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
the year 1634, we celebrated the Mass for
the first time on this island [St. Clement’s].
This had never been done before
in this part of the world. After we
had completed the sacrifice, we took upon
our shoulders a great cross which we
had hewn out of a tree, and advancing in
order to the appointed place, with the assistance
of the governor and his associates,
and the other Catholics, we erected
a trophy to Christ the Saviour, humbly
reciting on our bended knees the Litanies
of the Sacred Cross with great emotion.”<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

</div>

<p>They founded a city, the capital
of the colony, and called it St.
Mary’s. A Catholic chapel was
subsequently erected there; and this
too was dedicated to S. Mary.
The city has passed away, but the
little chapel still stands, preserved
alike by Catholic and Protestant
hands, as a monument of the faith
and zeal of the Catholic pilgrims
of Maryland. Mr. Griffith, the historian,
uniting his voice to that of
Bancroft and other writers, speaking
of the object which inspired
the settlement from its inception by
Lord Baltimore in England, says:
“Out of respect for their religion
they planted the cross, and, after
fortifying themselves, plainly and
openly set about to obtain, by the
fairest means in their power, other
property and homes, where they
should escape the persecutions of
the religious and political reformers
of their native country at that
time.”<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>The church and parish of S.
Mary were for many years the headquarters
of the Jesuit missions of
Maryland. During the succeeding
years prior to 1649 there was a
steady influx of Catholics into the
colony from England, as is evident
by the land records and other official
documents, and by the fact
that the number of Catholic priests
required for the settlement increased
from two in 1634 to four priests
and one coadjutor prior to 1644.
The Catholic strength was also increased
by numerous conversions,
as is shown by Father White’s
<cite>Narrative</cite>, in which, at page 56,
he relates that, “among the
Protestants, nearly all who came
over from England, in this year
1638, and many others, have been
converted to the faith, together
with four servants … and five
mechanics whom we … have in
the meantime won to God.” So
numerous were these conversions,
and they created so great a sensation
in England, that measures were
taken there to check them.</p>

<p>That the colony was Catholic in
its origin, and so continued until
after the year 1649, when the Toleration
Act was passed, has never
been denied, according to our researches,
except by Mr. Gladstone
and the two Protestant ministers
whom he quotes. Bancroft, writing
of the religious toleration which
prevailed in Maryland during this
period, always speaks of it as the
work of Catholics. In referring to
the original colonists he adds,
“most of them Roman Catholic
gentlemen and their servants.”
Even so unfriendly a writer as Bozman
says: “The most, if not all, of
them were Catholics.” Chancellor
Kent speaks of the colony as
“the Catholic planters of Maryland,”
and Judge Story says they
were “chiefly Roman Catholics.”
Father White, in his <cite>Narrative</cite>,
speaks of the few Protestants on
board the <i>Ark</i> as individuals, and
not as a class. Bozman, alluding
to the year 1639, and to “those in
whose hands the government of
the province was,” says: “A majority
of whom were, without doubt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
Catholics, as well as much the
greater number of the colonists.”
Mr. Davis, a Protestant, who drew
his information from the official
documents of the colony and State,
gives unanswerable proofs of the
fact for which we are contending.
We give a single passage from his
work on this point:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“St. Mary’s was the home&mdash;the chosen
home&mdash;of the disciples of the Roman
Church. The fact has been generally received.
It is sustained by the tradition
of two hundred years and by volumes of
unwritten testimony; by the records of the
courts; by the proceedings of the privy
council; by the trial of law-cases; by the
wills and inventories; by the land-records
and rent-rolls; and by the very
names originally given to the towns and
<em>hundreds</em>, to the creeks and rivulets, to
the tracts and manors of the county. The
state itself bears the name of a Roman
Catholic queen. Of the six <em>hundreds</em> of
this small county, in 1650, five had the
prefix of <em>St.</em> Sixty tracts and manors, most
of them taken up at a very early period,
bear the same Roman Catholic mark.
The creeks and villages, to this day, attest
the widespread prevalence of the
same tastes, sentiments, and sympathies.
Not long after the passage of the act relating
to ‘religion,’ the Protestants, it is
admitted, outgrew their Roman Catholic
brethren, and in 1689 succeeded very
easily in their attempt to overthrow the
proprietary. But judging from the composition
of the juries in 1655, we see no
reason to believe that they then had a majority.”<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Gladstone seems to favor the
view that religious toleration in
Maryland was derived from the
charter. We are surprised at this,
since “E. D. N.” (Rev. Edward
D. Neill), whose pamphlet has furnished
the substance of the entire
passage we have quoted from Mr.
Gladstone’s <cite>Preface</cite>, says in his
<cite>Maryland not a Roman Catholic Colony</cite>,
“The charter of Maryland
granted to Lord Baltimore was not
a charter of religious liberty, but
the very opposite.” McSherry, a
Catholic historian, says that “the
ecclesiastical laws of England, so
far as related to the consecration
and presentation of churches and
chapels, were extended to the colony,
but the question of state religion
was left untouched, and therefore
within the legislative power of
the colonists themselves.”<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> And
Bozman, a Protestant historian,
adopts the same view of the charter,
for he regards the “Act for
Church Liberties” passed in 1639,
enacting that “Holy Church within
this province shall have all her
rights and privileges,” as an attempt
to exercise a control of religion, and
says: “We cannot but suppose that
it was the intention of the Catholic
government to erect a hierarchy,
with an ecclesiastical jurisdiction,
similar to the ancient Church of
England before the Reformation,
and to invest it with all its rights,
liberties, and immunities.”<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> The
same views are expressed by the
same author at pages 68 and 350 of
his history. While civil liberty
was guaranteed by the charter to
all within the province, we find no
mention of religious toleration in its
provisions. Nor do we find that
immigration was made free by the
charter, as alleged by Mr. Gladstone;
the provision to which he
refers simply assures to the subjects
of England, “transported or
to be transported into the province,
all privileges, franchises, and liberties
of this our kingdom of England,”
but the decision of the point
as to who should be transplanted
or admitted to settle there was
left to the lord proprietary and
the provincial legislature. The
grant by the king to Lord Baltimore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
of all the lands of the province
in itself gave him the full
control over immigration, by enabling
him to fix the conditions to
the grants of land to colonists,
which would have kept out all except
such as the lord proprietary
wished to enter.</p>

<p>We think we have shown that the
Catholics were in the majority during
the whole period covered by
our discussion, and that the charter
left them free to protect themselves
from intrusion; that they were, consequently,
all-powerful to perpetuate
their numerical preponderance
and control of the government.
Why had they not the same motives
for practising intolerance as the
Puritans? Their positions, respectively
and relatively, were the
same in this particular, and the
same reasons apply to both. No,
they were actuated by a different
spirit, and guided by different traditions.
They possessed the power,
and used it with mercy and benevolence;
not only permitting
but inviting Christians of every
shade of opinion to settle in the
province, but also offering grants
of land on easy terms, and protecting
the settlers from molestation on
account of their religion. If they
had not the power to proscribe,
why should Bancroft, Griffith,
Chambers, Kent, Story, and nearly
all writers on the subject, have bestowed
such encomiums on them for
doing what they could not have refrained
from doing? Why extol
the toleration enjoined by Lord
Baltimore and proclaimed by Governor
Leonard Calvert, and the subsequently
enacted Toleration Act
of 1649, if the liberty it enacts was
already secured by the charter of
1632?</p>

<p>It is not necessary for us to go
further into this question, since in
either event the honor and credit
of religious toleration in Maryland
is due to a Catholic source. If the
charter secured it, our answer is
that the charter itself was the work
of a Catholic, for Lord Baltimore
is the acknowledged author of that
document. “The nature of the
document itself,” says Bancroft,
“and concurrent opinion, leave no
doubt that it was penned by the
first Lord Baltimore himself, although
it was finally issued for the
benefit of his son.”<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> “It was prepared
by Lord Baltimore himself,”
says McSherry, “but before it was
finally executed that truly great
and good man died, and the patent
was delivered to his son, Cecilius,
who succeeded as well to his noble
designs as to his titles and estates.”<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
It will be more than sufficient
to add here that both Mr.
Bozman and the Rev. Ethan Allen
concede that Lord Baltimore was
the author of the charter.</p>

<p>We propose now to show that the
religious toleration which prevailed
in Maryland had its origin in
the good-will, generosity, and mercy
of the Catholic lord proprietary
and his Catholic government and
colony of Maryland; was practised
from the very beginning of the settlement,
and that we are not indebted
for it to the Toleration Act
of 1649, except perhaps as a measure
by which its provisions were
prolonged. Toleration was the
course adopted in organizing the
Maryland colony, even in England
and before the landing of the pilgrims.
Thus we find that some
Protestants were permitted to accompany
the colonists and share
equal rights and protection with
their Catholic associates. Father
White speaks of them on board the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
<i>Ark</i> and <i>Dove</i>. The author of
<cite>Maryland not a Catholic Colony</cite> refers
to the fact that “Thomas
Cornwallis and Jerome Hawley,
who went out as councillors of the
colony, were adherents of the
Church of England,” as evidence
in part that Maryland was “not a
Catholic colony.” We take the
same fact to show that not only
were Protestants tolerated in the
colony from its inception, but were
liberally and generously given a
share in its government. The Rev.
Ethan Allen relates a succession
of proofs of this fact, though not
for that purpose, in the following
passage: “Witness the fact of so
large a portion of the first colonists
being Protestants; his invitation to
Capt. Fleet; his invitation to the
Puritan colonists of Massachusetts
to come and reside in the colony
in 1643; his constituting Col. Stone
his governor in 1648, who was a
Protestant, and was to bring five
hundred colonists; his admitting
the Puritans of Virginia in the same
year; and in the year following
erecting a new county for Robert
Brooke, a Puritan, and his colonists.”<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
McSherry says, speaking
of the act of possession on landing
in 1634: “Around the rough-hewn
cross, on the island of St. Clement’s,
gathered the Catholic and the Protestant,
hand in hand, friends and
brothers, equal in civil rights, and
secure alike in the free and full
enjoyment of either creed. It was
a day whose memory should make
the Maryland heart bound with
pride and pleasure.”<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> The same
author says that the Toleration Act
of 1649 was passed “to give <em>additional</em>
security to the safeguards
which Lord Baltimore <em>had already
provided</em>.” Bancroft makes religious
toleration commence from the
first landing “when the Catholics
took possession,” and extend
throughout the fourteen years up
to the passage of the act of 1649.
He says that “the apologist of
Lord Baltimore could assert that
his government, in conformity
with his strict and repeated injunctions,
had <em>never</em> given disturbance
to any person in Maryland for matter
of religion.”<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> The Rev. Ethan
Allen relates that the Protestants
in the colony were allowed to have
their own chapel and to conduct
therein the Protestant service. He
cites a case in which a Catholic
was severely punished for abusive
language towards some Protestant
servants in respect to their religion,
and remarks that “the settling of
the case was unquestionably creditable
and honorable to the Catholic
governor and council.”<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Mr.
Davis, a Protestant, says: “A
freedom, however, of a wider sort
springs forth at the <em>birth of the colony&mdash;not
demanded by that instrument</em>
[the charter], but permitted
by it&mdash;not graven upon the tables
of stone, nor written upon the paper
of the statute-books, but conceived
in the very bosom of the
proprietary and of the original pilgrims&mdash;not
a formal or constructive
kind, but a living freedom, a
freedom of the most practical sort.
It is the freedom which it remained
for them, and for them alone,
<em>either to grant or deny</em>&mdash;a freedom
embracing within its range, and
protecting under its banner, all
those who were believers in Jesus
Christ.”<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>Again, the same author writes:
“The records have been carefully
searched. No case of persecution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
occurred, during the administration
of Gov. Leonard Calvert, from
the foundation of the settlement
at St. Mary’s to the year 1647.”<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
Langford, a writer contemporaneous
with the period of which we are
treating, in his <cite>Refutation of Babylon’s
Fall</cite>, 1655, confirms the
result of Mr. Davis’ investigation
of the records. The Protestants
of the colony themselves, in a <em>declaration</em>,
of which we will speak
again, attribute the religious toleration
they enjoyed not solely to
the Toleration Act, but also to
“<em>several other strict injunctions and
declarations of his said lordship for
that purpose made and provided</em>.”
Gov. Leonard Calvert also enjoined
the same by a proclamation,
which is mentioned by numerous
historians. A case arising under
this proclamation is given by Bozman
and others in 1638, eleven
years before the passage of the
Toleration Act. Capt. Cornwallis’
servants, who were Protestants, were
lodged under the same roof with
William Lewis, a zealous Catholic,
who was also placed in charge of
the servants. Entering one day
the room where the servants were
reading aloud from a Protestant
book&mdash;Mr. Smith’s <cite>Sermons</cite>&mdash;at
the very moment the Protestants
were reading aloud a passage to
the effect “that the pope was Antichrist,
and the Jesuits were anti-Christian
ministers,” supposing
that the passage was read aloud especially
for him to hear, he ordered
them with great warmth not to
read that book, saying that “it was
a falsehood, and came from the devil,
as all lies did; and that he that
writ it was an instrument of the
devil, and he would prove it; and
that all Protestant ministers were
ministers of the devil.” All the
parties were tried before the governor
and his council; the case
against the servants was postponed
for further testimony, but Mr. Lewis,
the Catholic, was condemned
to pay a fine of five hundred pounds
of tobacco (then the currency of
the colony), and to remain in the
sheriff’s custody until he found
sufficient sureties in the future.
Bozman thus remarks upon this decision:
“As these proceedings took
place before the highest tribunal
of the province, composed of the
three first officers in the government,
they amply develop the
course of conduct with respect to
religion which those in whose
hands the government of the province
was placed, had resolved to
pursue.”<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Not only did the Catholic
lord proprietary, in 1648, appoint
Mr. Stone, a Protestant, to
be the governor of the province,
but also he at the same time appointed
a majority of the privy
councillors from the same faith.</p>

<p>We will close our testimony on
this point with the official oath
which Lord Baltimore required the
governor and the privy councillors
to take; it was substantially as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I will not by myself nor any person,
directly or indirectly, trouble, molest, or
discountenance any person whatsoever in
said province professing to believe in
Jesus Christ, for or in respect to his or
her religion, nor in his or her free exercise
thereof.”</p>

</div>

<p>We cannot determine when this
oath began to be used. Bancroft
places it between 1636 and 1639.
Chalmers, Dr. Hawks, and others
give the time as between 1637 and
1657. It is certain that this oath
was prescribed prior to the passage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
of the Toleration Act; for Governor
Stone and the councillors took
the oath in 1648, and there is reason
to believe that it was in use at
a much earlier period.</p>

<p>Referring to the period anterior
to the passage of the Toleration
Act, Bancroft says: “Maryland at
that day was unsurpassed for happiness
and liberty. Conscience was
without restraint.”<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Mr. Davis, in
reference to this subject, writes:
“The toleration which prevailed
from the first, and for fifteen years
later, was formally ratified by the
voice of the people” (in 1649).</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone’s view of the
subject is evidently superficial;
it relates exclusively to the passage
of the Toleration Act, and
was conceived and published without
the knowledge of the fact,
which we have demonstrated, that
the toleration for which the Catholics
of Maryland have been so
much praised had been practised
for fifteen years before the passage
of that act. Surely, there can be
no rival claim set forth in behalf
of Protestants for the period we
have mentioned. Mr. Gladstone
sets up his claim for the Protestants
under that act. We cannot admit
the justice or truth of the pretension.
Let us examine it. This
law enacted that “no one professing
to believe in Jesus Christ shall
be troubled, molested, or discountenanced
for his religion, or the free
exercise thereof, nor compelled to
the belief or exercise of any other
religion against his consent.” Now
here, too, the claim set up by Mr.
Gladstone, and by the authors of
the pamphlets he quotes, is met by
stern facts.</p>

<p>In the first place, the Toleration
Act of 1649 was the work of a
Catholic. It was prepared in England
by Lord Baltimore himself,
and sent over to the Assembly with
other proposed laws for their action.
This fact is related by nearly
all writers on Maryland history, including
those consulted by Mr.
Gladstone, except the writer of
<cite>Maryland not a Roman Catholic
Colony</cite>, who does not refer to the
subject, except to claim that it was
but the echo of a previous and
similar order of the English House
of Commons in 1645 and of a statute
passed by it in 1647. The last-named
writer even intimates that
the Rev. Thomas Harrison, the
former pastor of the Puritans at
Providence, afterward Annapolis,
in Maryland, suggested the whole
matter to Lord Baltimore. We
might even admit this pretension
without impairing the Catholic
claim. It does not destroy the
credit due to the Catholics of
Maryland in passing the Toleration
Act to show that others, even Puritans,
entertained in one or two instances
similar views and enacted
similar measures. We know that
the Puritans in England were proscriptive,
and that in New England
they did not practise the toleration
of Maryland. Even if Lord
Baltimore had the measure suggested
to him by the Puritan Harrison,
the act itself, when adopted
by him and put in practice, is still
his act and that of the Assembly
which passed it. It remains their
free and voluntary performance.
The merit which attaches to the
good deeds of men is not destroyed
by having been suggested by
others. A Puritan might even
share in the act without appropriating
the whole credit to himself.
But whatever merit is claimed for
the Puritans in these measures&mdash;which
we cannot perceive&mdash;is lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
by their subsequent conduct. They
overturned the government of Lord
Baltimore in Maryland, and under
their ascendency Catholics were
persecuted in the very home of
liberty to which Catholics had
invited the Puritans. But of the
existence of the English toleration
acts mentioned by the writer
referred to and by Mr. Gladstone,
we have been supplied with no
proof. That the Puritan Harrison
suggested the measure to Lord Baltimore
is hinted at, not roundly asserted,
certainly not sustained by
proof.</p>

<p>But public facts give the negative
to these pretensions. The
Toleration Act of 1649 was the
immediate echo of the actual toleration
which, under the injunctions
of Lord Baltimore, the proclamation
of Governor Calvert, and
the uniform practice of the colonists,
had long become the common
law of the colony. Why seek,
in the turbulent and confused proceedings
of the Long Parliament, a
model or example for the Maryland
law, when such exemplar is
supplied nearer home by the colony
itself from its first inception?
To the people of Maryland, in
1649, the Toleration Act was nothing
new; it was readily and unanimously
received; it produced no
change in the constitution of the
province. Toleration was not the
law or the practice of that day,
either in England or her colonies;
the echo was too remote and too
readily drowned by the din of persecution
and of strife.</p>

<p>But the Maryland Toleration Act
contains intrinsic evidence of a
purely Catholic origin. The clause
enforcing the honor and respect
due to “the blessed Virgin Mary,
the Mother of our Saviour,” which
we have already quoted, gives a
Catholic flavor to the whole statute,
and excludes the theory of parliamentary
or puritanical influence
in originating the measure. The
claim thus set up is also against the
concurrent voice of history, which,
with great accord, gives the authorship
of the law to Lord Baltimore,
who, as he had enjoined and enforced
its provisions on the colony
for fifteen years, needed no assistance
in reducing them to the form
of a statute, which we are informed
he did.</p>

<p>But who were the lawgivers of
1649, and what was their religion?</p>

<p>By the charter the law-making
power was vested in Lord Baltimore
and the Assembly. It was for
some years a matter of contest between
them which possessed the
right to initiate laws. The lord
proprietary, however, finally conceded
this privilege to the Assembly.
It was not uncommon for the
Assembly to reject the laws first
sent over by the lord proprietary,
and afterwards to bring them forward
themselves and pass them.
But in 1648, when Governor Stone
was appointed, the Toleration Act
was among the measures sent by
Lord Baltimore, for the action of the
Assembly. The government, then,
consisted of Cecilius, Lord Baltimore,
a Catholic, without whose
sanction no law could be enacted,
and whose signature to the measure
in question was given the following
year. The journal of the Maryland
legislature was lost or destroyed,
but fortunately a fragment of it is
preserved, consisting of a report
from the financial committee of the
Assembly, and the action of that
body on the bill of charges. With
this document, and the aid of the
historical facts recorded by Bozman
and other historians, we are
enabled to ascertain the names of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
the members of the Assembly in
1649.</p>

<p>Gov. Stone was lieutenant-governor
and president of the council,
which was composed of Thomas
Green, John Price, John Pile, and
Robert Vaughan, commissioned by
the lord proprietary; and the remaining
councillors were Robert
Clarke, surveyor-general, and Thomas
Hatton, secretary of the colony,
<i lang="la">ex-officio</i> members of the council.
The other members of the Assembly
were the representatives of the
freemen, or burgesses, as follows:
Cuthbert Fenwick, Philip Conner,
William Bretton, Richard Browne,
George Manners, Richard Banks,
John Maunsell, Thomas Thornborough,
and Walter Peake, nine in
number. The governor, councillors,
and burgesses made sixteen in
all; but as Messrs. Pile and Hatton,
one Catholic and one Protestant,
were absent, the votes actually cast
were fourteen. On the memorable
occasion in question the councillors
and burgesses sat in one
“house,” and as such passed the
Toleration Act. Of the fourteen
thus voting, Messrs. Green, Clarke,
Fenwick, Bretton, Manners, Maunsell,
Peake, and Thornborough were
Catholics, and Messrs. Stone, Price,
Vaughan, Conner, Banks, and
Browne were Protestants. The
Catholics were eight to six Protestants.</p>

<p>But the Assembly was not the
only law-making branch of the government.
The executive, or lord
proprietary, was a co-ordinate
branch, and without his co-operation
no law could pass. Now, the
executive was a Catholic, and a
majority of the Assembly were Catholics;
so that we have it as a historical
fact that in a government
composed of two co-ordinate
branches, <em>both branches of the law-making
power</em> which enacted the
Toleration Act <em>were Catholic</em>. It
is an important fact that if all the
Protestant members of the Assembly
had voted against the law, the Catholic
majority could and would
have passed it, and the Catholic
executive was only too ready to
sanction his own measure. It cannot,
therefore, be said that the Catholics
could not have passed the
law without the Protestant votes;
for we have seen that both of the
co-ordinate branches of the government
were in the hands of the Catholics.</p>

<p>Waiving, however, the division
of the government into two co-ordinate
branches, by which method
we have the entire government
Catholic; and regarding the lord
proprietary merely as individual,
computing the lawgivers of 1649
simply numerically, we have the
following result:</p>

<p class="center">LAWGIVERS OF 1649.</p>

<p>As Catholics we would be quite
content with this showing; but we
are indebted to several Protestant
authors&mdash;more impartial than
Messrs. Gladstone, Allen, and Neill,
who write solely in the interests of
sect&mdash;for a computation of the respective
Catholic and Protestant
votes in the Assembly in 1649, which,
leaving out Lord Baltimore, and
making the number of votes fourteen,
gives, according to their just
and strictly legal computation,
<em>eleven Catholic votes and three Protestant
votes for the Act of Toleration</em>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
Mr. Davis, in his <cite>Day-Star of American
Freedom</cite>, and Mr. William Meade
Addison, in his <cite>Religious Toleration
in America</cite>, both Protestant authors,
take this view, and enforce it with
strong facts and cogent reasonings.
We will quote a passage, however,
from only one of these works, the
former, showing their views and
the method by which they arrive at
the respective numbers <em>eleven</em> and
<em>three</em>. Mr. Davis writes: “The
privy councillors were all of them,
as well as the governor, the special
representatives of the Roman Catholic
proprietary&mdash;under an express
pledge, imposed by him shortly before
the meeting of the Assembly
(as may be seen by the official oath),
to do nothing at variance with the
religious freedom of any believer in
Christianity&mdash;and removable any
moment at his pleasure. It would
be fairer, therefore, to place the
governor and the four privy councillors
on the same side as the six
Roman Catholic burgesses. Giving
Mr. Browne to the other side, <em>we
have eleven Roman Catholic against
three Protestant votes</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>We think, however, that if the
computation is to be made by numbers,
Lord Baltimore must be included,
as the act received his executive
approval, and could never
have become a law without it.
Thus, according to the views of
Messrs. Davis and Addison, with
this amendment by us, the numbers
would stand twelve Catholic
against three Protestant votes. But
we prefer taking our own two several
methods of computation, viz.,
by co-ordinate branches of the government,
showing&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Another method of computation">
  <tr>
    <td><i>Catholic.</i></td>
    <td><i>Protestant.</i></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The executive, Lord Baltimore,<br />
        The Assembly, 2.</td>
    <td>None.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;and that estimated by numbers,
counting Lord Baltimore as one,
showing&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Another method of computation">
  <tr>
    <td>Catholics, 9.</td>
    <td>Protestants, 6.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>This surely is a very different result
from that announced by Mr.
Gladstone, following the author of
<cite>Maryland not a Roman Catholic Colony</cite>&mdash;viz.,
sixteen Protestant against
eight Catholic votes. So far the
numbers given by Mr. Gladstone
and the writer he follows are mere
assertion, unsupported by authority,
either as to the composition
of the Assembly or the respective
religious beliefs of the members.
Mr. Davis, however, gives in detail
every member’s name, and refers to
the proof by which he arrives at
their names and number; and the
same testimony is open, we presume,
to the examination of all.
In order that there may be no
lack of proof as to the religious
faiths they professed, he gives a
personal sketch of each member
of the Assembly in 1649, and
proves from their public acts, their
deeds of conveyance, their land
patents, their last wills and testaments,
the records of the courts,
etc., that those named by him as
Catholics were incontestably of
that faith.</p>

<p>The population of the colony in
1649 was also largely Catholic beyond
dispute. We have already
shown that it was Catholic by a
large majority during the fifteen
years preceding and up to that
time. The above computations,
showing a majority of the legislature
to be Catholic, strongly indicates
the complexion of the religious
faith of their constituents.
Up to 1649 St. Mary’s, the Catholic
county, was the only county in
the State, and Kent, the seat of the
Protestant population, was only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
<em>hundred</em> of St. Mary’s. Kent was
not erected into a county until the
year the Toleration Act was passed.
While St. Mary’s was populous
and Catholic, Kent was Protestant
and thinly settled. There
were six <em>hundreds</em> in St. Mary’s, all
Catholic except perhaps one, and
of that one it is uncertain whether
the majority was Catholic or Protestant.
“But the population of
Kent,” says Davis, “was small. In
1639, if not many years later, she
was but a <em>hundred</em> of St. Mary’s
county.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> In 1648 she paid a fifth
part only of the tax, and did not
hold in the Assembly of that year
a larger ratio of political power.
That also was before the return, we
may suppose, of all the Roman
Catholics who had been expelled
or exported from St. Mary’s by
Capt. Ingle and the other enemies
of the proprietary. In 1649 she
had but one delegate, while St.
Mary’s was represented by eight.
And this year she paid but a sixth
part of the tax, and for many years
after as well as before this Assembly
there is no evidence whatever
of a division of the island (of
Kent) or the county, even into
<em>hundreds</em>. Its population did not,
in 1648, exceed the fifth, nor in
1649 the sixth, part of the whole
number of free white persons in
the province.”<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> After a thorough
examination of the records, Mr.
Davis arrives at the conclusion that
the Protestants constituted only
one-fourth of the population of
Maryland at the time of the passage
of the Toleration Act, in
1649. His investigations must
have been careful and thorough,
for he gives the sources of his information,
refers to <i lang="la">liber</i> and <i lang="la">folio</i>,
and cites copiously from the public
records. He thinks that for twenty
years after the first settlement&mdash;to
wit, about the year 1654&mdash;the Catholics
were in the majority. He concludes
his chapter on this subject
with the following passage: “Looking,
then, at the question under
both its aspects&mdash;regarding the
faith either of the delegates or of
those whom they substantially represented&mdash;we
cannot but award the
chief honor to the members of the
Roman Church. To the Roman
Catholic freemen of Maryland is
justly due the main credit arising
from the establishment, by a solemn
legislative act, of religious freedom
for all believers in Christianity.”<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>But, fortunately, we have another
document at hand, signed in the
most solemn manner by those who
certainly must have known the
truth of the case, as they were the
contemporaries, witnesses of, and
participators in, the very events of
which we are treating. This is
what is usually known as the Protestant
<cite>Declaration</cite>, made the year
after the passage of the Toleration
Act, and shortly after it was known
that Lord Baltimore had signed the
act and made it the law of the
land. This important document is
an outpouring of gratitude from
the Protestants of the colony to
the Catholic proprietary for the
religious toleration they enjoyed
under his government. It is signed
by Gov. Stone, the privy councillors
Price, Vaughan, and Hatton&mdash;all
of whom were members
of the Assembly that passed the
Toleration Act&mdash;by all the Protestant
burgesses in the Assembly
of 1650, and by a great number of
the leading Protestants of the colony.
They address Lord Baltimore
in these words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We, the said lieutenant, council,
burgesses, and other <em>Protestant</em> inhabitants
above mentioned, whose names are
hereunto subscribed, do declare and certify
to all persons whom it may concern
that, according to an act of Assembly
here, <em>and several other strict injunctions
and declarations by his said lordship</em>, we
do here enjoy all fitting and convenient
freedom and liberty in the exercise of our
religion, under his lordship’s government
and interest; and that none of us are
anyways troubled or molested, for or by
reason thereof, within his lordship’s said
province.”<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This important document is dated
the 17th of April, 1650. It
proves that the religious toleration
they enjoyed was not due alone to
the act of 1649, but to the uniform
policy of Lord Baltimore and his
government; and that even for the
Toleration Act itself, which had recently
become a law by his signature,
they were indebted to a Catholic.
Comment on such testimony
is unnecessary.</p>

<p>Chancellor Kent, with the charter,
the public policy of Lord Baltimore,
of his colonial officers and
colonists, and the Toleration Act of
1649, all submitted to his broad and
profound judicial inquiry and
judgment, has rendered the following
opinion and tribute to the
Catholic lawgivers of Maryland, to
whom he attributes the merit of
the generous policy we are considering:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The legislature had already, in 1649,
declared by law that no persons professing
to believe in Jesus Christ should be
molested in respect to their religion, or
in the free exercise thereof, or compelled
to the belief or exercise of any other religion
against their consent. Thus, in
the words of a learned and liberal historian
(Grahame’s <cite>History of the Rise and
Progress of the United States</cite>), the Catholic
planters of Maryland won for their
adopted country the distinguished praise
of being the first of American States in
which toleration was established by law,
and while the Puritans were persecuting
their Protestant brethren in New England,
and Episcopalians retorting the
same severity on the Puritans in Virginia,
the Catholics, against whom the others
were combined, formed in Maryland a
sanctuary where all might worship and
none might oppress, and where even Protestants
sought refuge from Protestant
intolerance.”<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Catholics have written comparatively
little upon this subject. The
historians of Maryland have been
chiefly Protestants. As long as
Protestants so unanimously accorded
to the Catholic founders of
Maryland the chief credit of this
great event, it was unnecessary for
Catholics to speak in their own behalf.
It has remained for Mr. Gladstone
and the two sectarian ministers
he follows to attempt to mar
the harmony of that grateful and
honorable accord of the Protestant
world, by which Catholic Maryland
received from the united voice of
Protestant history the enviable title
of “<cite>The Land of the Sanctuary</cite>.”</p>

<h3>ARE YOU MY WIFE?</h3>

<p class="center">BY THE AUTHOR OF “PARIS BEFORE THE WAR,” “NUMBER THIRTEEN,” “PIUS VI.,” ETC.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="smaller">A DINNER AT THE COURT, WITH AN EPISODE.</span></h4>

<p>Crossing from the station to his
brougham, Sir Simon saw Mr. Langrove
issuing from a cottage on the
road. The vicar had been detained
later than he foresaw on a sick-call,
and was hurrying home to
dress for dinner. It was raining
sharply. Sir Simon hailed him:</p>

<p>“Shall I give you a lift, Langrove?”</p>

<p>“Thank you; I shall be very
glad. I am rather late as it is.”
And they got into the brougham together.</p>

<p>“And how wags the world with
you, my reverend friend? Souls
being saved in great numbers, eh?”
inquired the baronet when they
had exchanged their friendly greetings.</p>

<p>“Humph! I am thankful not to
have the counting of them,” was
the reply, with a shake of the head
that boded ill for the sanctification
of Dullerton.</p>

<p>“That’s it, is it? Well, we are
all going down the hill together;
there is some comfort in that. But
how about Miss Bulpit? Don’t
her port wine and tracts snatch a
few brands from the burning?”</p>

<p>“For the love of heaven don’t
speak to me of her! Don’t, I beg
of you!” entreated the vicar, throwing
up his hands deprecatingly, and
moved from the placid propriety
that seemed a law of nature to him.</p>

<p>“Suppose I had good news to
report of her?”</p>

<p>“How so?” cried Mr. Langrove
with sudden vivacity. “She’s not
going to marry Sparks, is she?”</p>

<p>“Not just yet; but the next best
thing to that. She is going to leave
the neighborhood.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean it!”</p>

<p>“I do indeed. How is it you’ve
not heard of it before? She’s been
pestering Anwyll these two years
about some repairs or improvements
she wants done in her house&mdash;crotchets,
I dare say, that would
have to be pulled to pieces for the
next tenant. He has always politely
referred her to his agent,
which means showing her to the
door; but at last she threatened to
leave if he did not give in and do
what she wants.”</p>

<p>“Oh! is that all?” exclaimed the
vicar, crestfallen. “I might have
waited a little before I hallooed;
we are not out of the woods yet.
Anwyll is sure to give in rather
than let her go.”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the sort. He dislikes
the old lady, and so does his
mother, and so particularly does
your venerable <i lang="fr">confrère</i> of Rydal
Rectory. I met Anwyll this morning
at the club, and he told me he
had made up his mind to let her
go. It happens&mdash;luckily for you,
I suspect&mdash;that he has a tenant in
view to take her place. Come,
now, cheer up! Is not that good
news?”</p>

<p>“Most excellent!” said the vicar
emphatically. “I wonder where
she will move to?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>“Perhaps I could tell you that
too. She is in treaty with Charlton
for a dilapidated old hunting lodge
of his in the middle of a fir-wood
the other side of Axmut Common,
about twenty miles the other side
of Moorlands; it is as good as settled,
I believe, and if so we are
all safe from her.”</p>

<p>“Well, you do surprise me!” exclaimed
Mr. Langrove, his countenance
expanding into a breadth of
satisfaction that was absolutely radiant.
“Who is the incumbent of
Axmut, let me see?” he said, musing.</p>

<p>“There is as good as none; it is
a lonely spot, with no church within
ten miles, I believe. I shrewdly
suspect this was the main attraction;
for the life of him, Charlton
says, he can’t see any other. It is a
tumble-down, fag-end-of-the-world-looking
place as you would find in
all England. It must be the clear
coast for ‘dealing with souls,’ as she
calls it, that baited her. There is
a community of over a hundred
poor people, something of the gypsy
sort, scattered over the common
and in a miserable little hamlet
they call the village; so she may
preach away to her heart’s content,
and no one to compete or interfere
with her but the blacksmith, who
rants every Sunday under a wooden
shed, or on a tub on the common,
according to the state of the
weather.”</p>

<p>“Capital! That’s just the place
for her!” was the vicar’s jubilant
remark.</p>

<p>In spite of the pleasure that lit
up his features, usually so mild and
inexpressive, Sir Simon, looking
closely at the vicar, thought him
worn and aged. “You look tired,
Langrove. You are overworked, or
else Miss Bulpit has been too much
for you; which is it?” he said
kindly.</p>

<p>“A little of both, perhaps,” the
vicar laughed. “I have felt the
recent cold a good deal; the cold
always pulls me down. I’ll be all
right when the spring comes round
and hunts the rheumatism out of my
bones,” he added, moving his arm
uncomfortably.</p>

<p>“You ought to do like the swallow&mdash;migrate
to a warm climate before
the cold sets in,” observed Sir
Simon; “nothing else dislodges
rheumatism.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what Blink was saying
to me this morning. He urged
me very strongly to go away for a
couple of months now to get out of
the way of the east winds. He wants
me to take a trip to the South of
France.” Mr. Langrove laughed
gently as he said this.</p>

<p>“And why don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Because I can’t afford it.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, nonsense! Take it
first, and afford it afterwards.
That’s my maxim.”</p>

<p>“A very convenient maxim for
you, but not so practicable for an
incumbent with a large family and
a short income as for the landlord
of Dullerton,” said Mr. Langrove
good-humoredly.</p>

<p>The baronet winced.</p>

<p>“Prudence and economy are all
very well,” he replied, “but they
may be carried too far; your health
is worth more to you than any
amount of money. If you want the
change, you should take it and pay
the price.”</p>

<p>“I suppose we might have most
things, if we choose to take them on
those terms,” remarked the vicar.
“‘Take it and pay the price!’ says
the poet; but some prices are too
high for any value. Who would do
my work while I was off looking after
my health? Is that Bourbonais
hurrying up the hill? He will get
drenched; he has no umbrella.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>“Like him to go out a day like
this without one,” said Sir Simon
in an accent of fond petulance.
“How is he? How is Franceline?
How does she look?”</p>

<p>“Poorly enough. If she were
my child, I should be very uneasy
about her.”</p>

<p>“Ha! does Bourbonais seem uneasy?
Do you see much of him?”</p>

<p>“No; not through my fault, nor
indeed through his. We have each
our separate work, and these winter
days are short. I met him this
morning coming out of Blink’s as I
went in. I did not like his look;
he had his hat pulled over his eyes,
and when I spoke to him he answered
me as if he hardly knew
who I was or what he was saying.”</p>

<p>“And you did not ask if there
was anything amiss?” said Sir Simon
in a tone of reproach.</p>

<p>“I did, but not him. I asked
Blink.”</p>

<p>“Ha! what did he say?” And
the baronet bent forward for the
answer with an eager look.</p>

<p>“Nothing very definite&mdash;you
know his grandiloquent, vague talk&mdash;but
he said something about hereditary
taint on the lungs; and I
gathered that he thought it was a
mistake not having taken her to a
warm climate immediately after
that accident to her chest; but
whether the mistake was his or the
count’s I could not quite see. I
imagine from what he said that
there was a money difficulty in
the way, or he thought there
was, and did not, perhaps, urge the
point as strongly as he otherwise
would.”</p>

<p>Sir Simon fell back on the cushions,
muttering some impatient exclamation.</p>

<p>“That was perhaps a case where
the maxim of ‘take it first and afford
it afterwards’ would seem justifiable,”
observed Mr. Langrove.</p>

<p>“Of course it was! But Bourbonais
is such an unmanageable
fellow in those things. The strongest
necessity will never extract
one iota of a sacrifice of principle
from him; you might as well try to
bend steel.”</p>

<p>“He has always given me the
idea of a man of a very high sense
of honor, very scrupulous in doing
what he considers his duty,” said
Mr. Langrove.</p>

<p>“He is, he is,” assented the baronet
warmly; “he is the very ideal
and epitome of honor and high
principle. Not to save his life
would he swerve one inch from the
straight road; but to save Franceline
I fancied he might have been
less rigid.” He heaved a sigh, and
they said no more until the brougham
let Sir Simon down at his own
door, and then drove on to take Mr.
Langrove to the vicarage.</p>

<p>A well-known place never appears
so attractive as when we look at it
for the last time. An indifferent
acquaintance becomes pathetic
when seen through the softening
medium of a last look. It is like
breaking off a fraction of our lives,
snapping a link that can never be
joined again. A sea-side lodging,
if it can claim one sweet or sad
memory with our passing sojourn
there, wears a touching aspect when
we come to say “good-by,” with
the certainty that we shall never
see the place again. But how if the
spot has been the cradle of our
childhood, the home of our fathers
for generations, where every stone
is like a monument inscribed with
sacred and dear memories? Sir
Simon was not a sentimental man;
but all the tenderness common to
good, affectionate, cultivated natures
had its place in his heart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
He had always loved the old home.
He was proud of it as one of the
finest and most ancient houses of
his class in England; he admired
its grand and noble proportions, its
architectural strength and beauty;
and he had the reverence for it
that every well-born man feels for
the place where his fathers were
born, and where they have lived and
died. But never had the lordly
Gothic mansion looked to him so
home-like as on this cold January
evening when he entered it, in all
human probability, for the last time.
It was brilliantly lighted up to welcome
him. The servants, men and
women, were assembled in the hall
to meet him. It was one of those
old-fashioned patriarchal customs
that were kept up at the Court,
where so many other old customs
survived, unhappily less harmless
than this. As Sir Simon passed
through the two rows of glad, respectful
faces, he had a pleasant
word for all, as if his heart were
free from care.</p>

<p>The hall was a sombre, cathedral-like
apartment that needed floods
of light to dispel its oppressive solemnity.
To-night it was filled with
a festal breadth of light; the great
chandelier that hung from the groined
roof was in a blaze, while the
bronze figures all around supported
clusters of lamps that gleamed
like silver balls against the dark
wainscoting. The dining-room and
library, which opened to the
right, stood open, and displayed a
brilliant illumination of lamps and
wax-lights. Huge fires burned hospitably
on all the hearths. The
table was ready spread; silver
and crystal shone and sparkled on
the snowy damask; flowers scented
the air as in a garden. Sir Simon
glanced at it all as he passed.
Could it be that he was going to
leave all this, never to behold it
again? It seemed impossible that
it could be true.</p>

<p>As he stood once more in the
midst of his household gods, those
familiar divinities whose gentle power
he had never fully recognized until
now, it seemed to him that he
was safe. There was an unaccountable
sense of security in their mere
presence; they smiled on him, and
seemed to promise protection for
their shrine and their votary.</p>

<p>The baronet went straight to his
room, made a hasty toilet, and came
down to the library to await his
guests.</p>

<p>He was in hopes that Raymond
would have come before the others,
and that they might have a little
talk together. But Raymond was
behind them all. Everybody was
assembled, the dinner was waiting,
and he had not yet arrived.</p>

<p>It was a mere chance that he
came at all. Nothing, in fact, but
the dread of awakening Franceline’s
suspicions had withheld him from
sending an excuse at the last moment;
but that dread, which so
controlled his life in every act, almost
in every thought, compelling
him to hide his feelings under a
mask of cheerfulness when his heart
was breaking, drove him out to
join the merry-makers. It was all
true what Mr. Langrove had said.
There had been a return of the
spitting of blood that morning, very
slight, but enough to frighten Angélique
and hurry her off with her
charge to the doctor. He had talked
vaguely about debility&mdash;nervous
system unstrung&mdash;no vital mischief
so far; the lungs were safe. The
old woman was soothed, and went
home resolved to do what was to
be done without alarming her master
or telling him what had occurred.
She counted, however, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
Miss Merrywig. That pleasant
old lady happened from the distance
to see them coming from the
doctor’s house, and, on meeting the
count next morning, asked what
report there was of Franceline.
Raymond went straight to Blink’s.</p>

<p>“I ask you as a man of honor to
tell me the truth,” he said; “it is
a matter of life and death to me to
know it.”</p>

<p>The medical man answered his
question by another: “Tell me
frankly, are you in a position to
take her immediately to a warm
climate? I should prefer Cairo;
but if that is impossible, can you
take her to the South of France?”</p>

<p>Raymond’s heart stood still.
Cairo! It had come to this, then.</p>

<p>“I can take her to Cairo,” he
said, speaking deliberately after a
moment’s silence. “I will take her
at once.”</p>

<p>He thought of Sir Simon’s blank
check. He would make use of it.
He would save his child; at least
he would keep her with him a few
years longer. “Why did you not
tell me this sooner?” he asked in
a tone of quick resentment.</p>

<p>“I did not believe it to be essential.
I thought from the first it
would have been desirable; but
you may recollect, when I suggested
taking her even to the South of
France, your daughter opposed the
idea with great warmth, and you
were silent. I inferred that there
was some insuperable obstacle in
the way, and that it would have
been cruel as well as useless to
press the matter.”</p>

<p>“And you say it is not too late?”</p>

<p>“No. I give you my word, as
far as I can see, it is not. The return
of the spitting of blood is a
serious symptom, but the lungs as
yet are perfectly sound.” M. de la
Bourbonais went home, and opened
the drawer where he kept the
blank check; not with the idea of
filling it up there and then&mdash;he
must consider many things first&mdash;but
he wanted to see it, to make
sure it was not a dream. He examined
it attentively, and replaced
it in the drawer. A gleam of satisfaction
broke out on the worn,
anxious face. But it vanished
quickly. His eye fell on Sir Simon’s
letter of the day before.
He snatched it up and read it
through again. A new and horrible
light was breaking on him. Sir Simon
was a ruined man; he was going
to be turned out of house and
home; he was a bankrupt. What
was his signature worth? So much
waste paper. He could not have a
sixpence at his bankers’ or anywhere
else; if he had, it was in the hands
of the creditors who were to seize
his house and lands. “Why did he
give it to me? He must have known
it was worth nothing!” thought
Raymond, his eyes wandering over
the letter with a gaze of bewildered
misery.</p>

<p>But Sir Simon had not known it.
It was not the first time he had
overdrawn his account with his
bankers; but they were an old-fashioned
firm, good Tories like
himself. The Harnesses had banked
with them from time immemorial,
and there existed between them
and their clients of this type a sort
of adoption. If Sir Simon was in
temporary want of ready money, it
was their pleasure as much as their
business to accommodate him; the
family acres were broad and fat.
Sir Simon was on friendly but not
on confidential terms with his
bankers; they knew nothing of
the swarm of leeches that were fattening
on those family acres, so
there was no fear in their minds as
to the security of whatever accommodation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
he might ask at their
hands. When Sir Simon signed
the check he felt certain it would
be honored for any amount that
Raymond was likely to fill it up
for. But since then things had
come to a crisis; his signature was
now worth nothing. Lady Rebecca,
on whose timely departure from
this world of care he had counted
so securely as the means of
staving off a catastrophe, had again
disappointed him, and the evil hour
so long dreaded and so often postponed
had come. Little as Raymond
knew of financial mysteries,
he was too intelligent not to guess
that a man on the eve of being
made a bankrupt could have no
current account at his bankers’.
Dr. Blink’s decree was, then, the
death-warrant of his child! Raymond
buried his face in his hands
in an agony too deep for tears.
But the sound of Franceline’s step
on the stairs roused him. For her
sake he must even now look cheerful;
love is a tyrant that allows no
quarter to self. She came in and
found her father busy, writing away
as if absorbed in his work. She
knew his moods. Evidently he did
not want her just now; she would
not disturb him, but drew her little
stool to the chimney corner and
began to read. An hour passed.
It was time for her father to dress
for dinner; but still the sound of
the pen scratching the paper went
on diligently.</p>

<p>“Petit père, it is half-past six,
do you know?” said the bright, silvery
voice, and Raymond started
as if he had been stung.</p>

<p>“So late, is it? Then I must be
off at once.” And he hurried
away to dress, and only looked in
to kiss her as he ran down-stairs,
and was off.</p>

<p>“Loiterer!” exclaimed Sir Simon,
stretching out both hands and clasping
his friend’s cordially.</p>

<p>“I have kept you waiting, I fear.
The fact is, I got writing and forgot
the hour,” said the count apologetically.</p>

<p>Dinner was announced immediately,
and the company went into
the dining-room.</p>

<p>They were a snug number, seven
in all; the only stranger amongst
them being a Mr. Plover, who happened
to be staying at Moorlands.
He was an unprepossessing-looking
man, sallow, keen-eyed, and with a
mouth that superficial observers
would have called firm, but which
a physiognomist might have described
as cruel. His hair was
dyed, his teeth were false&mdash;a
shrunken, shrivelled-looking creature,
whose original sap and verdure,
if he ever had any, had been
parched up by the fire of tropical
suns. He had spent many years in
India, and was now only just returned
from Palestine. What he
had been doing there nobody particularly
understood. He talked
of his studies in geology, but they
seemed to have been chiefly confined
to the study of such stones
as had a value in the general market;
he had a large collection of
rubies, sapphires, and diamonds,
some of which he had shown to
Mr. Charlton, and excited his wonder
as to the length of the purse
that could afford to collect such
costly souvenirs of foreign lands
simply as souvenirs. Mr. Plover
had met his host accidentally a week
ago, and discovered that he and the
father of the latter had been school-fellows.
The son was not in a position
either to verify or disprove
the assertion, but Mr. Plover was
so fresh in his affectionate recollection
of his old form-fellow that
young Charlton’s heart warmed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
him, and he then and there invited
him down to Moorlands. He could
not do otherwise than ask Sir Simon
to include him in his invitation to
the Court this evening; but he
did it reluctantly. He was rather
ashamed of his pompous, self-sufficient
friend, whose transparent faith
in the power and value of money
gave a dash of vulgarity to his
manners, which was heightened by
contrast with the well-bred simplicity
of the rest of the company.
He had not been ten minutes in
the room when he informed them
that he meant to buy an estate if
he could find an eligible one in this
neighborhood; if not, he would
rent the first that was to be had on
a long lease. He wanted to be
near his young friend Charlton.
Sir Simon was extremely civil to
him&mdash;surprisingly so.</p>

<p>The other faces we know: Mr.
Langrove, bland, serious, mildly
exhilarated just now, like a man
suddenly relieved of a toothache&mdash;Miss
Bulpit was going from the
parish; Mr. Charlton running his
turquois ring through his curly
light hair, and agreeing with everybody
all round; Lord Roxham,
well-bred and lively; Sir Ponsonby
Anwyll, a pleasant sample of the
English squire, blond-visaged, good-tempered,
burly-limbed, and displaying
a vast amount of shirt-front;
M. de la Bourbonais, a distinct
foreign type, amidst these familiar
English ones, the face furrowed
with deep lines of study, of
care too, unmistakably, the forehead
moulded to noble thought,
the eyes deep-set under strong projecting
black brows, their latent
fire flashing out through the habitually
gentle expression when he
grew animated. He was never a
talkative man in society, and to-night
he was more silent than
usual; but no one noticed this, not
even Sir Simon. He was too much
absorbed in his own preoccupation.
Raymond sat opposite him as his
<i lang="la">alter ego</i>, doing the honors of one
side of the hospitable round table.</p>

<p>The conversation turned at first
on generalities and current events;
the presence of Mr. Plover, instead
of feeding it with a fresh stream,
seemed to check the flow and prevent
its becoming intimate and personal.
Sir Simon felt this, and
took it in his own hands and kept
it going, so that, if not as lively as
usual, it did not flag. Raymond
looked on and listened in amazement.
Was yesterday’s letter a
dream, and would this supreme
crisis vanish as lesser ones had so
often done? Was it possible that a
man could be so gay&mdash;so, to all appearance,
contented and unconcerned,
on the very brink of ruin, disgrace,
beggary, banishment&mdash;all, in
a word, that to a man of the baronet’s
character and position constitute
existence? He was not in
high spirits. Raymond would not
so much have wondered at that.
High spirits are sometimes artificial;
people get them up by stimulants
as a cloak for intense depression.
No, it was real cheerfulness and
gayety. Was there any secret hope
bearing him up to account for the
strange anomaly? Raymond could
speculate on this in the midst of
his own burning anxiety; but for
the first time in his life bitterness
mingled with his sympathy for the
baronet. Was it not all his own
doing, this disgrace that had overtaken
him? He had been an unprincipled
spendthrift all his life,
and now the punishment had come,
and was swallowing up others in its
ruin. If he had not been the reckless,
extravagant man that he was,
he might at this moment be a harbor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
of refuge to Raymond, and save
his child from a premature death.
But he was powerless to help any
one. This is what his slavish
human respect had brought himself
and others to. A few hundred
pounds might save, or at any rate
prolong for perhaps many years,
the life of the child he professed to
love as his own, and he had not
them to give; he had squandered
his splendid patrimony in the most
contemptible vanity, in selfish indulgence
and unprofitable show.
And there he sat, a piece of tinsel
glittering like true gold, affable,
jovial, as if care were a hundred
miles away from him. M. de la
Bourbonais felt as if he were in a
dream, as if everything were unreal&mdash;everything
except the vulture that
was gnawing silently at his own
heart.</p>

<p>The conversation grew livelier as
the wine went round. Mr. Plover
was attending carefully to his dinner,
and was content to let others
do the most of the talking. A discussion
arose as to a case of something
very like perjury that a magistrate
of the next county had been
involved in. Some were warmly
defending, while others as warmly
condemned, him. Mr. Plover suspended
the diligence of his knife
and fork to join with the latter;
he was almost aggressive in his
manner of contradicting the other
side. The story was this: A magistrate
had to judge a case of libel
where the accused was a friend of
his own, who had saved him from
being made a bankrupt some years
before by lending him a large sum
of money without interest or security.
The evidence broke down, and
the man was acquitted. It transpired,
however, a few days later,
that the magistrate had in his possession
at the time of the trial proof
positive of his friend’s guilt. In
answer to this charge he replied
that the evidence in question had
come to his knowledge under the
seal of confidence; that he was
therefore bound in honor not only
not to divulge it, but to ignore its
existence in forming his judgment
on the case. The statement was
denied, and it was affirmed that the
only seal which bound him was one
of gratitude, and that he was otherwise
perfectly free to make use of
his information to condemn the
accused.</p>

<p>The dispute as to the right and
the wrong of the question was growing
hot, when Sir Ponsonby Anwyll,
who noticed how silent Raymond
was, called out to him across the
table:</p>

<p>“And what do you say, count?”</p>

<p>“I should say that gratitude in
such a case might stand in the
place of a verbal promise and
compel the judge to be silent,” replied
Raymond.</p>

<p>“The temptation to silence was
very strong, no doubt, but would it
justify him in pronouncing an acquittal
against his conscience?”
asked Mr. Langrove.</p>

<p>“It was not against his conscience,”
replied the count; “on
the contrary, it was in accordance
with it, since it was on the side of
mercy.”</p>

<p>“Quite a French view of the
subject!” said Mr. Plover superciliously,
showing his shining teeth
through his coal-black moustache.
“If I were a criminal, commend me
to a French jury; but if innocent,
give me an English one!”</p>

<p>“Mercy has perhaps too much
the upper hand with our tender-hearted
neighbors,” observed Sir
Simon; “but justice is none the
worse for being tempered with it.”</p>

<p>“That is neither here nor there,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
said Mr. Plover. “Justice is justice,
and law is law; and it strikes
me this Mr. X&mdash;&mdash; has tampered
with both, and it’s a very strange
thing if he is not tabooed as a perjurer
who has dodged the letter of
the law and escaped the hulks, but
whom no gentleman ought from this
out to associate with.”</p>

<p>“Come, come, that is rather
strong language,” said Mr. Langrove.
“We must not outlaw on
mere inferential evidence a man
who has borne all his life a most
honorable name; and if worse
comes to worst, we must remember
it would go hard with the best of us
to put a social brand on a friend that
we were deeply indebted to, if we
could by any possibility find a loophole
of escape for him. A man
may remain strictly honest in the
main, and yet not be heroic enough
not to save a friend on a quibble.”</p>

<p>“Why, to be sure; there are honest
men and honest men,” assented
Plover. “I’ve known some whose
moral capacity expanded to camels
when expediency demanded the
feat and it could be done discreetly.
It’s astounding what some of
these honest men can swallow.”</p>

<p>Sir Simon felt what this speech
implied of impertinence to Mr.
Langrove, and, indeed, to everybody
present. “Roxham,” he said irrelevantly,
“why is your glass
empty? Bourbonais, are you passing
those delectable little <i lang="fr">patés de
foie gras</i>?”</p>

<p>Raymond helped himself mechanically,
as the servant presented
again the rejected dish.</p>

<p>“It would be a nice thing to define
exactly the theory of truth
and its precise limits,” observed
Mr. Langrove in his serious, sententious
way, addressing himself to
no one in particular.</p>

<p>“One should begin by defining
the nature of truth, I suppose,”
said Mr. Plover. “Let us have a
definition from our host!”</p>

<p>“Oh! if you are going in for
metaphysics, I hand you over to
Bourbonais!” said Sir Simon good-humoredly.
“Take the pair of
them in hand, Raymond, and run
them through the body for our edification.”</p>

<p>Raymond smiled.</p>

<p>“I should very much like to
have the count’s opinion on this
particular point of metaphysics or
morals, whichever it may be,” said
Mr. Plover. “Do you believe it
possible for a man to effect such a
compromise with his conscience,
and yet be, as our reverend friend
describes him, a blameless and upright
man?”</p>

<p>“I do,” answered M. de la Bourbonais
with quiet emphasis. “I
doubt if any simple incident can
with safety be taken as the key of
a man’s character. One fault, for
instance, may stand out in his life
and color it with dishonor, and yet
be a far less trustworthy index to his
real nature than, a very slight fault
committed deliberately and involving
no consequences. We are more
deliberate in little misdeeds than in
great ones. When a man commits
a crime, he is not always a free
agent as regards the command of
his moral forces; there are generally
a horde of external influences
at work overpowering his choice,
which is in reality his individual
self. When he succumbs to this
pressure from without, we cannot
therefore logically consider him as
the sole and deliberate architect of
his sin; hard necessity, fear of disgrace,
love of life, nay, some generous
feeling, such as gratitude or
pity, may hurry a man into a criminal
action as completely at variance
with the whole of his previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
and subsequent life as would
be the act of a Christian flinging
himself out of the window in a fit
of temporary insanity.”</p>

<p>“Subtly put,” sneered Mr. Plover.
“If we were to follow up that
theory, we might find it necessary
on investigation to raise statues to
our forgers and murderers, instead
of sending them to the hulks and
the gallows.”</p>

<p>“It opens a curious train of
thought, nevertheless,” remarked
Lord Roxham.</p>

<p>“I don’t fancy it would be a
very profitable one to pursue,” said
Plover.</p>

<p>“I have sometimes considered
whether it may not on given occasions
be justifiable to do evil; I
mean technically evil, as we class
things,” said Lord Roxham.</p>

<p>“For instance?” said Mr. Langrove.</p>

<p>“Well, for instance&mdash;I’ll put it
mildly&mdash;to convey a false idea of
facts, as your friend X&mdash;&mdash; seems to
have done in this libel business. I
suppose there are cases where it
would be morally justifiable?”</p>

<p>“To tell a lie, you mean? That
is a startling proposition,” said the
vicar, smiling.</p>

<p>“It has the merit of originality,
at least,” observed Mr. Plover,
helping himself to a tumblerful of
claret.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it can’t boast even
that,” said Lord Roxham; “it is
only an old sophism rather bluntly
put.”</p>

<p>“I should like to hear the Count
de la Bourbonais’ opinion on it,”
said Mr. Plover, rolling the decanter
across to his self-elected antagonist.</p>

<p>Raymond had feigned unconsciousness
of the stranger’s insolent
tone thus far, though he had detected
it from the first, and was only too
deeply possessed by other thoughts
to resent it or to care a straw for
what this stranger or any human
being thought of him or said to
him. But the persistency of the attack
forced him to notice it at last,
if not to repel it; he was not sufficiently
interested in the thing for
that. But he was roused from the
kind of stinging lethargy in which he
had hitherto sat there, nibbling at
one thing or another, oftener playing
with his knife and fork, and touching
nothing. He laid them down
now, and pushed aside his glass,
which had been emptied to-night
oftener than was his wont.</p>

<p>“You mean to ask,” he said, “if,
according to our low French code
of morals, we consider it justifiable
to commit a crime for the sake of
some good to ourselves or others?”</p>

<p>“I don’t go quite that length,”
replied Mr. Plover; “but I assume
from what you have already said
that you look on it as permissible
to&mdash;tell a lie, for example, under
given circumstances.”</p>

<p>“I do,” said Raymond.</p>

<p>There was a murmur of surprise
and dissent.</p>

<p>“My dear Bourbonais! you are
joking, or talking for the mere sake
of argument,” cried Sir Simon,
forcing a laugh; but he looked
vexed and astonished.</p>

<p>“I am not joking, nor am I arguing
for argument’s sake,” protested
Raymond with rising warmth.
“I say, and I am prepared to prove
it, that under given circumstances
we are justified in withholding the
truth&mdash;in telling a lie, if you like
that way of putting it better.”</p>

<p>“What are they?”</p>

<p>“Prove it!”</p>

<p>“Let us hear!”</p>

<p>Several spoke together, excited
and surprised, and every head was
bent towards M. de la Bourbonais.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
Raymond moved his spectacles, and,
fixing his dark gray eyes on Mr.
Plover as the one who had directly
challenged him, he said:</p>

<p>“Let us take an illustration.
Suppose you entrust me with that
costly diamond ring upon your
finger, I having promised on my
oath to carry it to a certain person
and to keep its possession a
secret. We will suppose that your
life and your honor depend on its
being delivered at its destination by
me and at a given time. On my
way thither I meet an assassin, who
puts his pistol to my breast and
says, ‘Deliver up your purse and a
diamond which I understand you
have on your person, or I shoot
you and take them; but if you give
me your word that you have not
got it, I will believe you and let
you go.’ Am I not justified, in order
to save your honor and life and
my own in answering, ‘No, I have
not got the diamond’?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not!” cried Plover
emphatically, bringing his jewelled
hand down on the table with a
crash.</p>

<p>“My dear sir!…” began
some one; but Raymond echoed
sharply:</p>

<p>“‘Certainly not!’ Just so. But
suppose I draw my pistol and shoot
the robber dead on the spot? God
and the law absolve me; I have a
right to kill any man who threatens
my life or my property, or that of
my neighbor.”</p>

<p>“You have! Undoubtedly you
have!” said two or three, speaking
together.</p>

<p>“And yet homicide is a greater
sin than a lie!” cried Raymond.
He was flushed and excited; his
eye sparkled and his hand trembled
as he pushed the glasses farther
away, and leaned on the table, surveying
the company with a glance
that had something of triumph and
something of defiance in it.</p>

<p>“Well done, Bourbonais!” cried
Sir Simon. “You’ve not left Plover
an inch of ground to stand on!”</p>

<p>“Closely reasoned,” said Mr.
Langrove, with a dubious movement
of the head; “but.…”</p>

<p>“Sophistry! a very specious bit
of sophistry!” said Mr. Plover in a
loud voice, drowning everybody
else’s. “Comte and Rousseau and
the rest of them in a nutshell.”</p>

<p>“Crack it, then, and let’s have the
kernel!” said Lord Roxham. He
was growing out of patience with
the dictatorial tone of this vulgar
man.</p>

<p>“Just so!” chimed in Mr. Charlton,
airing a snowy hand and signet
gem, and falling back in his
chair with the air of a man wearied
with hard thinking.</p>

<p>“It’s too preposterous to answer,”
was Plover’s evasive taunt; “it’s
mere casuistry.”</p>

<p>“A very compact bit of casuistry,
at any rate,” said Sir Simon, with
friendly pride in Raymond’s manifest
superiority over his assembled
guests; “it strikes me it would take
more than our combined wits to answer
it.”</p>

<p>“Egad! I’d eat my head before
<em>I’d</em> answer it!” confessed Ponsonby
Anwyll, who shared the baronet’s
personal complacency in the count’s
superior brain. But Raymond had
lapsed into his previous silent mood,
and sat absently toying with a plate
of bonbons before him, and apparently
deaf to the clashing of tongues
that he had provoked. There was
something very touching in his look,
in the air of gentle dejection that
pervaded him, and which contrasted
strikingly with the transient
warmth he had displayed while
speaking. Sir Simon noticed it,
and it smote him to the heart. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
the first time this evening he bethought
him how his own cheerfulness
must strike Raymond, and
how he must be puzzled to account
for it. He promised himself the
pleasure of explaining it to his satisfaction
before they parted to-night;
but meanwhile it gave him
a pang to think of the iron that
was in his friend’s soul, though it
was part of his pleasant expectation
that he would be able to draw
it out and pour some healing balm
on the wound to-morrow. He would
show him why he had borne so patiently
with the vulgar pedagogue
who had permitted himself to fail,
at least by insinuation, in respect
to M. de la Bourbonais. The pedagogue
meanwhile seemed bent on
making himself disagreeable to the
inoffensive foreigner.</p>

<p>“It is a pity X&mdash;&mdash; was not
able to secure Count de la Bourbonais
as counsel,” he began again.
“In the hands of so skilful a casuist
his backsliding might have
come out quite in a heroic light.
It would have been traced to his
poverty, which engendered his gratitude,
and so on until we had a verdict
that would have been virtually
a glorification of impecuniosity. It
is a pity we have missed the treat.”</p>

<p>“Poverty is no doubt responsible
for many backslidings,” said Raymond,
bridling imperceptibly. He
felt the sting of the remark as addressed
to him by the rich man, or
he fancied he did. “The world
would no doubt be better as well as
happier if riches were more equally
divided; but there are worse
things in the world than poverty, for
all that.”</p>

<p>“There is the excess of riches,
which is infinitely worse&mdash;a more
unmitigated source of evil, taking it
all in all,” said Mr. Langrove.</p>

<p>“Well said for a professional, my
dear sir,” laughed Mr. Plover; “but
you won’t find many outsiders to
agree with you, I suspect.”</p>

<p>“If by outsiders you mean Turks,
Jews, and Hottentots, I daresay you
are right,” said the vicar good-temperedly.</p>

<p>“I mean every sensible man who
is not bound by his cloth to talk
cant&mdash;no offence; I use the word
technically&mdash;you won’t find one
such out of a thousand to deny that
riches are the best gift of heaven,
the one that can buy every other
worth having&mdash;love and devotion
into the bargain.”</p>

<p>“What rank heresy you are propounding,
my dear sir!” exclaimed
Sir Simon, taking a pinch from his
enamelled snuff-box, and passing it
on. “You will not find one sane
man in a thousand to agree with
you!”</p>

<p>“Won’t I though? What do you
say, count?”</p>

<p>“I agree with you, monsieur,”
said Raymond with a certain asperity;
“money can purchase most
things worth having, but I deny
that it can always pay for them.”</p>

<p>“Ha! there we have the sophist
again. It can buy, and yet it can’t
pay. Pray explain!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Raymond?”
said Sir Simon, darting a curious,
puzzled look at his friend.</p>

<p>“It is very simple. I mean that
money may sometimes enable us
to confer an obligation which no
money can repay. We may, for instance,
do a service or avert a sorrow
by means of a sum of money,
and thus purchase love and gratitude&mdash;things
which Mr. Plover has
included in those worth having,
and which money cannot pay for,
though it may be the means of buying
them.” The look that accompanied
the answer said more to Sir
Simon than the words conveyed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
any one else. He averted his eyes
quickly, and was all at once horrified
to discover several empty
glasses round the table. They were
at dessert now.</p>

<p>“Charlton, have you tried that
Madeira? Help yourself again, and
pass it on here, will you? I shall
have to play Ganymede, and go
round pouring out the nectar to
you like so many gods, if you don’t
bestir yourselves.”</p>

<p>And then there was a clinking
of glasses, as the amber and ruby
liquid was poured from many a curious
flagon into the glistening crystal
cups.</p>

<p>“Talking of gods, that’s a god’s
eye that you see there on Plover’s
finger,” observed Mr. Charlton,
whose azure gem was quite eclipsed
by the flashing jewel that had suggested
M. de la Bourbonais’ illustration.
“It was set in the forehead
of an Indian idol. Just let Sir Simon
look at it; he’s a judge of
precious stones,” said the young
man, who felt that his feeble personality
gained something from the
proximity of so big a personage,
and was anxious to show him off.
The latter complacently drew the
ring from his finger and tossed it
over to his host. It was a large
white diamond of the purest water,
without the shadow of a flaw.</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> a beauty!” exclaimed Sir
Simon with the enthusiasm of a connoisseur;
“only it’s too good to be
worn by a man. It ought to have
gone to a beautiful woman when it
left the god. I suppose it will soon,
eh, Plover?”</p>

<p>Mr. Plover laughed. He was
not a marrying man, he said, but he
would make no rash vows. Then
he went on to tell about other precious
stones in his possession. He
had some amazingly sensational
stories to relate concerning them
and how he became possessed of
them. We generally interest others
when we get on a subject that thoroughly
interests ourselves and that
we thoroughly understand. Mr.
Plover understood a great deal
about these legendary gems, and
the celebrated idols in which they
had figured; he had, moreover, imbibed
a certain tinge of Oriental
superstition concerning the talismanic
properties of precious gems,
and invested them, perhaps half unconsciously,
with that kind of prestige
that is not very far off from
worship. This flavor of superstition
pierced unawares through his
discourse on the qualities and adventures
of various rubies and sapphires
that had played stirring parts
in the destinies of particular gods,
and were universally believed to
influence for good or evil the
lives of mortals who became possessed
of them.</p>

<p>The company began to find him
less disagreeable as he went on.
They did not quite believe in him;
but when a story-teller amuses us,
we are not apt to quarrel with him
for using a traveller’s privilege and
drawing the long bow.</p>

<p>By the time this vein was exhausted
the party had quite forgiven
the obnoxious guest, and admitted
him within the sympathetic ring
of good-fellowship and conviviality.
M. de la Bourbonais had become
unusually talkative, and contributed
his full share to the ebb and
flow of lively repartee. He was
generally as abstemious as an anchorite;
but to-night he broke
through his ascetic habits, and filled
and refilled his glass many times.
It was deep drinking for him,
though for any one else it would
have been reckoned moderate.
Before the dessert was long on the
table the effect of the wine was visible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
in his excited manner and the
shrill tone of his voice, that rose
high and sharp above the others in
a way that was quite foreign to his
gentleness. Sir Simon saw this,
and at once divined the cause. It
gave him a new pang. Poor Raymond!
Driven to this to keep his
misery from bursting out and overwhelming
him!</p>

<p>“Shall we finish our cigars here
or in the library?” asked the baronet
when his own tired limbs suggested
that a change of posture
might be generally agreeable.</p>

<p>As by tacit consent, the chairs
were all pushed back and everybody
rose. The clock in the hall
was striking ten.</p>

<p>“Do you know I think I must be
going?” said Mr. Langrove. “Time
slips quickly by in pleasant company;
I had no idea it was so late!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! you are not going
to leave us yet!” protested Sir Simon.
“Don’t mind the clocks
here; they’re on wheels.”</p>

<p>“Are they?” said the vicar, and
innocently pulled out his watch to
compare it with the loud chime that
was still trembling in the air.
“Humph! I see your wheels are
five minutes slower than mine!” he
said, with a nod and a laugh at his
prevaricating host.</p>

<p>“Come, now, Langrove, never
mind the time. ‘Hours were made
for slaves,’ you know. Come in and
have another cigar,” urged Sir Simon.</p>

<p>But the vicar was firm.</p>

<p>“Then I may as well go with
you,” said M. de la Bourbonais;
“it’s late already for me to be
out.”</p>

<p>Sir Simon was beginning to protest,
when his attention was called
away by Lord Roxham.</p>

<p>“Have you that diamond ring,
Harness?”</p>

<p>“What ring? Plover’s? No; I
passed it to you to look at, and it
didn’t come round to me again.
Can it not be found?”</p>

<p>“Oh! it’s sure to turn up in a
minute!” said Mr. Plover. “It has
slipped under the edge of a plate,
very likely!” And he went to the
table and began to look for it.</p>

<p>“Come, let us be going, as we are
going,” said M. de la Bourbonais
to the vicar, and he went towards
the door.</p>

<p>“Wait a bit,” replied Mr. Langrove&mdash;“wait
a moment, Bourbonais;
we must see the end of this.”</p>

<p>“What have we to see in it? It
is no concern of ours,” was the
slightly impatient rejoinder. Raymond
was in that state of unnatural
excitement when the least trifle
that crosses us chafes and irritates.
He had nothing for it, however, but
to comply with the vicar’s fancy
and wait.</p>

<p>“Most extraordinary!” Sir Simon
exclaimed, as crystal dishes
and porcelain plates were lifted and
moved, and silver filigree baskets
overturned and their delicate fruits
sent rolling in every direction. “It
must have dropped; stand aside,
everybody, while I look under the
table.” Every one drew off. Sir
Simon flung up the ends of the
snowy cloth, and, taking a chandelier
with several lights, set it on the
floor and began carefully to examine
the carpet; but the ring was
nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>“If it is here, it is certain to be
seen,” he said, still bent down.
“Look out, all of you, as you stand;
you may see it flash better in the
distance.”</p>

<p>But no flash was anywhere visible.
The wax-lights discovered
nothing brighter than the subdued
colors of the rich Persian carpet.
Sir Simon went round to the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
side of the table, and searched with
the same care and the same result.</p>

<p>“You are not an absent man, are
you?” he said, lifting the chandelier
from the ground, and addressing
the owner of the missing ring.
“You are not capable of slipping it
into your pocket unawares?”</p>

<p>“I never did such a thing in my
life; but that is no reason why I
may not have done it now. Old
wine sometimes plays the deuce
with one,” said Mr. Plover, and he
began to rummage his pockets and
turn their contents on to the table-cloth.
Its whiteness threw every
article into vivid relief; but there
was no ring.</p>

<p>“This is very singular, very extraordinary
indeed!” said Sir Simon
in a sharp tone of annoyance.
“Is any one hoaxing? Charlton,
you’re not playing a trick on us, are
you?”</p>

<p>“What should I play such a stupid
trick as that for?” demanded
the young man. “I’m not such an
idiot; but here goes! Let us have
my pockets on the table too!”</p>

<p>And following his friend’s example,
he turned them inside out, coat,
waistcoat, and trousers pockets in
succession; but no ring appeared.</p>

<p>“It is time we all followed suit,”
said Sir Simon, and he cleared a
larger space by sweeping away
plates and glasses. “I am given to
absence of mind myself, and, as you
say, I may have taken a glass more
than was good for me.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he turned out one
pocket after another, with no other
result than to show the solidity and
unblemished freshness of the linings;
there was not a slit or the
sign of one anywhere where a diamond
ring, or a diamond without a
ring, could have slipped through.</p>

<p>“Well, gentlemen, I invite you
all to follow my example!” said the
host, stepping back from the table,
and motioning for any one that liked
to advance. His voice had a ring
of command in it that would have
compelled obedience if that had
been necessary; but it did not
seem to be so. One after another
the guests came up and repeated
the operation, while the owner of
the ring watched them with a face
that grew darker with every disappointment.
Mr. Langrove and M.
de la Bourbonais were standing
somewhat apart from the rest near
the door, and were now the only
two that remained. The vicar
came first. He submitted his pockets
to the same rigorous scrutiny,
and with the same result. A
strange gleam passed over Mr. Plover’s
features, as he turned his sallow
face in the direction of M. de
la Bourbonais. Suspicion and hope
had now narrowed to this last trial.
Raymond did not move. “Come
on, Bourbonais; I have done!” said
Mr. Langrove, consigning his spectacles
and his handkerchief to his
last pocket.</p>

<p>But Raymond remained immovable,
as if he were glued to the carpet.</p>

<p>“Come, my dear friend, come!”
Sir Simon called out, in a voice
that was meant only to be kind and
encouraging, but in which those
who knew its tones detected a nervous
note.</p>

<p>“I will not!” said the count in
a sharp, high key. “I will not
submit to such an indignity; it has
been got up for the purpose of insulting
me. I refuse to submit to
it!”</p>

<p>He turned to leave the room.</p>

<p>“Raymond, you are mad! You
<em>must</em> do it!” cried Sir Simon imperatively.</p>

<p>“I am not mad! I am poor!”
retorted the count, facing round
and darting eyes of defiance at Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
Simon. “This person, who calls
himself a gentleman, has insulted me
from the moment I sat down to table
with him, and you allowed him
to do it. He taunted me with my
poverty; he would make out now
that because I am poor I am a
thief! I have borne with him so
far because I was at your table;
but there is a limit to what I will
bear. I will not submit to the outrage
he wants to put upon me.”</p>

<p>Again he turned towards the
door.</p>

<p>“You shall hand out my ring before
you stir from here, my fine sir!”
cried Mr. Plover, taking a stride after
him, and stretching out an arm
as if to clutch him; but Sir Simon
quick as thought intercepted him
by laying a hand on the outstretched
arm, while Ponsonby Anwyll
stepped forward and placed his tall,
broad figure like a bulwark between
Raymond and his assailant.</p>

<p>“Let me go!” said the latter,
shaking himself to get free from the
baronet’s clasp; but the long, firm
fingers closed on him like grim
death.</p>

<p>“You shall not touch M. de la
Bourbonais in my presence,” he
said; “you have insulted him, as he
says, already. If I had seen that he
detected what was offensive in your
tone and manner, I would not have
suffered it to pass. Stand back, and
leave me to deal with him!”</p>

<p>“Confound the beggar! Let
him give me my ring! I don’t
want to touch him; but as I live
he doesn’t stir from this room till
I’ve seen his breeches pocket turned
wrong-side out!”</p>

<p>The man had been drinking
heavily, and, though he was still to
all intents and purposes sober, this
excitement, added to that caused
by the wine, heated his blood to
boiling-point. He looked as if he
would have flown at Raymond;
but cowed by Sir Simon’s cool self-command
and determined will, he
fell back a step, fastening his eyes
on Raymond with a savage glare.</p>

<p>Raymond meantime continued
obstinate and impracticable. Mr.
Langrove took his hand in both
his, and in the gentlest way entreated
him to desist from his suicidal
folly; assuring him that he was the
last man present whom any one in
his senses would dream of suspecting
of a theft, of the faintest approach
to anything dishonorable,
but that it was sheer madness to
refuse to clear himself in the eyes
of this stranger. It was a mere
form, and meant no more for him
than for the rest of them. But
Raymond turned a deaf ear to his
pleading.</p>

<p>“Let me go! I will not do it!
He has been insulting me from the
beginning. I will not submit to
this,” he repeated, and shook himself
free from Mr. Langrove’s friendly
grasp.</p>

<p>Sir Simon came close up to him.
He was pale and agitated in spite
of his affected coolness, and his
hand shook as he laid it on Raymond’s
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Raymond, for my sake, for
God’s sake!” he muttered.</p>

<p>But Raymond thrust away his
hand, and said with bitter scorn:
“Ha! I am a beggar, and so I
must be a thief! No, I will not
clear myself! Let this rich man
go and proclaim me a thief!” And
breaking away from them all, he
dashed out of the room.</p>

<p>“Hold! Stop him, or by &mdash;&mdash;
I’ll make hot work of it for you!”
shouted Mr. Plover, making for the
door; but Ponsonby Anwyll set his
back to it, and defied him to pass.
If the other had been brave enough
to try, it would have been a hopeless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
attempt; his attenuated body
was no match for the stalwart limbs
of the young squire. He involuntarily
recoiled as if Ponsonby’s
arms, stoutly crossed on his breast,
had dealt him a blow. Lord Roxham
and Mr. Charlton pressed
round him, expostulating and trying
to calm him. This was no easy
task, and they knew it. They
were terribly shaken themselves,
and they felt that it was absurd to
expect this stranger, fuming for his
diamond, to believe that M. de la
Bourbonais had not taken it.</p>

<p>“No one but a madman would
have done such a thing, when it’s as
certain as death to be found out,”
said Sir Ponsonby, whose faith in
Raymond was sustained by another
faith. “Besides, we all know he’s
no more capable of it than we are
ourselves!”</p>

<p>“Very fine talk, but where is the
ring? Who has taken it, if not this
Frenchman? I tell you what, he
will be making out that it was his
right and his duty to steal from a
rich man to help a poor one. Perhaps
he’s hard up just now, and he
blesses Providence for the opportunity.”</p>

<p>“Remember, sir, that you are
speaking of a gentleman who is my
friend, and whom I know to be incapable
of an unworthy action,”
said Sir Simon in a stern and
haughty tone.</p>

<p>“I compliment you on your
friends; it sha’n’t be my fault if
you don’t see this one at the hulks
before long. But curse me! now I
think of it, I’m at your mercy, all
of you. I have to depend on you
as witnesses, and it seems the fashion
in these parts for gentlemen
to perjure themselves to screen a
friend; you will most likely refuse
to swear to facts&mdash;if you don’t
swear against them, eh?”</p>

<p>“You must be drunk; you don’t
know what you’re talking about,”
said Mr. Charlton, forgetting to
drawl, and speaking quickly like a
sensible man. “It is as premature
as it is absurd to imagine the ring
is stolen; it must be in the room,
and it must be found.”</p>

<p>“In the room or out of it, it
must and it shall be found!” echoed
Mr. Plover, “or if not.…”</p>

<p>“If not, it shall be paid for,”
added Mr. Charlton; “it shall be
replaced.”</p>

<p>“Replaced! All you’re worth
could not buy a stone like that
one!”</p>

<p>“Not its duplicate as a god’s
eye invested with magical virtue,”
said Mr. Charlton ironically; “but
its value in the market can be paid,
I suppose. What price do you
put on it?”</p>

<p>“As a mere stone it is worth
five hundred pounds to any jeweller
in London.”</p>

<p>“Five hundred pounds!” repeated
several in chorus with Mr.
Charlton.</p>

<p>Sir Simon said nothing. A mist
came before his eyes. He saw
Raymond in the grip of this cruel
man, and he was powerless to release
him. If the dread was an
act of disloyalty to Raymond, Sir
Simon was scarcely to blame. He
would have signed away five years
of his life that moment to see M.
de la Bourbonais cleared of the
suspicion that he had so insanely
fastened on himself; but how could
he help doubting? He knew as no
one else knew what the power of
the temptation was which had&mdash;had
it?&mdash;goaded him to the mad act.
Its madness was the strongest argument
against its possibility. To
pocket a ring worth five hundred
pounds&mdash;worth five pounds&mdash;in
the very teeth of the person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
it belonged to, and with the
clear certainty of being immediately
detected&mdash;no one in his right
mind would have done such a
thing. But was Raymond in his
right mind when he did it? Had
he been in his right mind since he
entered the house to-night? There
is such a thing as delirium of
the heart from sorrow or despair.
Then he had been drinking a great
deal more than usual, and wine beguiles
men to acts of frenzy unawares.
If Sir Simon could even
say to this man, “I will pay you the
five hundred pounds”; but he had
not as many pence to call his own.
There had been a momentary silence
after the exclamation of surprise
that followed the announcement
of the value of the diamond.
Would Mr. Charlton not ratify his
offer to pay for it? And if he did
not, what could save Raymond?</p>

<p>“Five hundred pounds! You
are joking!” said the young man.</p>

<p>“We’ll see whether I am or not!
I had the diamond valued with several
others at Vienna, where it was
set,” said Mr. Plover.</p>

<p>“Consider me your debtor for
the amount,” said Sir Ponsonby
Anwyll, stepping forward; “if the
ring is not found to-night, I will
sign you a check for five hundred
pounds.”</p>

<p>“Let us begin and look for it in
good earnest,” said Lord Roxham.
“We will divide; two will go at
each side of the table and hunt for
it thoroughly. It must have rolled
somewhere into a crevice or a corner.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how a ring was likely
to roll on this,” said Mr. Plover,
scratching the thick pile of the carpet
with the tip of his patent-leather
boot.</p>

<p>“Some of us may have kicked it
to a distance in pushing back our
chairs,” suggested Mr. Langrove;
“let us set the lights on the floor,
and divide as Lord Roxham proposes.”</p>

<p>Every one seized a chandelier
or a lamp and set it on the floor,
and began to prosecute the search.
They had hardly been two minutes
thus engaged when a loud ring was
heard, and after a momentary delay
the door opened and M. de la
Bourbonais walked in.</p>

<p>“Good heavens, Bourbonais! is
it you?” cried Sir Simon, rising
from his knees and hastening to
meet him.</p>

<p>But Raymond, with a haughty
gesture, waved him off.</p>

<p>They were all on their feet in a
moment, full of wonder and expectation.</p>

<p>“I made a mistake in refusing to
submit to the examination you
asked of me,” said the count, addressing
himself to all collectively.
“I was wrong to listen only to personal
indignation in the matter; I
saw only a poor man insulted by a
rich one. I have come back to repair
my mistake. See now for yourselves,
and, if you like, examine every
corner of my clothes.”</p>

<p>He advanced to the table, intending
to suit the action to the words,
when a burst of derisive laughter
was heard at the other end of the
room. It was from Mr. Plover.
The others were looking on silent
and confounded.</p>

<p>“Do you take us all for so many
born fools?” cried Mr. Plover, and
he laughed again a short, contemptuous
laugh that went through
Raymond’s veins.</p>

<p>He stood there, his right hand
plunged into his pocket in the act
of drawing out its contents, but arrested
by the sound of that mocking
laugh, and by the chill silence that
followed. He cast a quick, questioning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
glance at the surrounding
faces; pity, surprise, regret, were
variously depicted there, but neither
confidence nor congratulation were
visible anywhere. A gleam of light
shot suddenly through his mind.
He drew out his hand and passed
it slowly over his forehead.</p>

<p>“My God, have pity on me!”
he murmured almost inaudibly, and
turned away.</p>

<p>“Raymond! listen to me.” Sir
Simon hurried after him.</p>

<p>But the door was closed. Raymond
was gone. Sir Simon followed
into the hall, but he did not
overtake him; the great door closed
with a bang, and the friend he
loved best on earth was beyond his
hearing, rushing wildly on in the
darkness and under the rain, that
was falling in torrents.</p>

<p>The apparition had come and
gone so quickly that the spectators
might have doubted whether they
had not dreamt it or seen a ghost.
No one spoke, until Mr. Plover
broke out with a hoarse laugh and
an oath:</p>

<p>“If the fellow has not half convinced
me of his innocence! He’s
too great a fool to be a thief!”</p>

<p>“Until he has been proved a
thief, you will be good enough not
to apply the term to Monsieur de
la Bourbonais under my roof,” said
Sir Simon. “Now, gentlemen, we
will resume our search.”</p>

<p>They did, and prosecuted it with
the utmost care and patience for
more than an hour; but the only
effect was to fasten suspicion more
closely on the absent.</p>

<p>Mr. Plover was so triumphant
one would have fancied the justification
of his vindictive suspicion
was a compensation for the loss of
his gem.</p>

<p>“Have you a pen and ink here,
or shall I go into the library? I
want to write the check,” said
Ponsonby.</p>

<p>“You will find everything you
want in the library,” said Sir Simon,
and Ponsonby went in. Some one
rang, and the carriages and horses
were ordered. In a few minutes
Ponsonby returned with the check,
which he handed to Mr. Plover.</p>

<p>“If you require any one to attest
my solvency, I dare say Charlton,
whom you can trust, will have
no objection to do it,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“Certainly not!” said Mr. Charlton
promptly.</p>

<p>“Oh! it’s not necessary; I’m
quite satisfied with Sir Ponsonby
Anwyll’s signature,” Mr. Plover replied.
And as he pocketed the
check he went to the window and
raised the curtain to see if Mr.
Charlton’s brougham had come
round. The rest of the company
were saying good-by, cordial but
sad. Sir Simon and the young
squire of Rydal stood apart, conversing
in an earnest, subdued
voice.</p>

<p>“Have you a trap waiting, or
shall I drop you at the vicarage?”
inquired Lord Roxham of Mr.
Langrove.</p>

<p>“Thank you! I shall be very
glad,” said the vicar. “The night
promised to be so fine I said I would
walk home.”</p>

<p>“You will have a wet ride of it,
Anwyll; is not that your horse I
see?” cried Mr. Charlton from the
window, where he had followed his
ill-omened friend. “Had you not
better leave him here for the night,
and let me give you a lift home?”</p>

<p>“Oh! thank you, no; I don’t
mind a drenching, and it would
take you too far out of your way.”</p>

<p>Mr. Plover and Mr. Charlton
were leaving the room when Sir
Simon’s voice arrested them.</p>

<p>“One moment, Charlton! Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
Plover, pray wait a second. I need
not assure any one present how
deeply distressed I am by what has
occurred to-night&mdash;distressed on behalf
of every one concerned. I
know you all share this feeling with
me, and I trust you will not refuse
me the only alleviation in your
power.”</p>

<p>He stopped for a moment, while
his hearers turned eager, responsive
faces towards him.</p>

<p>“I ask you as a proof of friendship,
of personal regard and kindness
to myself, to be silent concerning
what has happened under
my roof to-night; to let it remain
buried here amongst ourselves.
Will you grant me this, probably
the last favor I shall ever ask of
you?”</p>

<p>His voice trembled a little; and
his friends were touched, though
they did not see where the last
words pointed.</p>

<p>There was a murmur of assent
from all, with one exception.</p>

<p>“Plover, I hope I may include
your promise with that of my older
friends?” continued the baronet,
his voice still betraying emotion.
“I have no right, it is true, to claim
such an act of self-denial at your
hands; I know,” he added with
a faint laugh that was not ironical,
only sad&mdash;“I know that it is a comfort
to us all to talk of our misfortunes
and complain of them to
sympathizing acquaintances; but I
appeal to you as a gentleman to
forego that satisfaction, in order to
save me from a bitter mortification.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, he held out his fine,
high-bred hand to his guest.</p>

<p>Sir Simon did not profess to be a
very deep reader of human nature,
but the most accomplished Macchiavellist
could not have divined
and touched the right chords in his
listener’s spirit with a surer hand
than he had just done. Mr. Plover
laid his shrivelled fingers in the
baronet’s extended hand, and said
with awkward bluntness:</p>

<p>“As a proof of personal regard
for you, I promise to hold my
tongue in private life; but you
can’t expect me not to take steps
for the recovery of the stone.”</p>

<p>“How so?” Sir Simon started.</p>

<p>“It is pretty certain to get into
the diamond market before long,
and, unless the police are put on the
watch, it will slip out of the country
most likely, and for ever beyond my
reach, and I would give double the
money to get it back again. But I
pledge myself not to mention the
affair except to the officers.”</p>

<p>He bowed another good-night to
the company, and was gone. The
rest quickly followed, and soon the
noise of wheels crushing the wet
gravel died away, and Sir Simon
Harness was left alone to meditate
on the events of the evening and
many other unpleasant things.</p>

<h3>RECOLLECTIONS OF WORDSWORTH.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a><br />
<span class="smaller">BY AUBREY DE VERE, ESQ.</span></h3>

<h4>PART I.</h4>

<p>It was about eight years before
his death that I had the happiness
of making acquaintance with Wordsworth.
During the next four years
I saw a good deal of him, chiefly
among his own mountains, and, besides
many delightful walks with
him, I had the great honor of passing
some days under his roof. The
strongest of my impressions respecting
him was that made by the manly
simplicity and lofty rectitude which
characterized him. In one of his later
sonnets he writes of himself thus:
“As a <em>true</em> man who long had served
the lyre”; it was because he
was a true man that he was a true
poet; and it was impossible to
know him without being reminded
of this. In any case he must have
been recognized as a man of original
and energetic genius; but it
was his strong and truthful moral
nature, his intellectual sincerity,
the abiding conscientiousness of his
imagination, so to speak, which enabled
that genius to do its great
work, and bequeath to the England
of the future the most solid mass of
deep-hearted and authentic poetry
which has been the gift to her of
any poet since the Elizabethan age.
There was in his nature a veracity
which, had it not been combined
with an idealizing imagination not
less remarkable, would to many
have appeared prosaic; yet, had
he not possessed that characteristic,
the products of his imagination
would have lacked reality. They
might still have enunciated a deep
and sound philosophy; but they
would have been divested of that
human interest which belongs to
them in a yet higher degree. All
the little incidents of the neighborhood
were to him important.</p>

<p>The veracity and the ideality
which are so signally combined in
Wordsworth’s poetic descriptions of
nature made themselves, at least, as
much felt whenever nature was the
theme of his discourse. In his intense
reverence for nature he regarded
all poetical delineations of
her with an exacting severity; and
if the descriptions were not true,
and true in a twofold sense, the more
skilfully executed they were the more
was his indignation roused by what
he deemed a pretence and a deceit.
An untrue description of nature
was to him a profaneness, a heavenly
message sophisticated and falsely
delivered. He expatiated much to
me one day, as we walked among
the hills above Grasmere, on the
mode in which nature had been described
by one of the most justly
popular of England’s modern poets&mdash;one
for whom he preserved a
high and affectionate respect. “He
took pains,” Wordsworth said; “he
went out with his pencil and note-book,
and jotted down whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
struck him most&mdash;a river rippling
over the sands, a ruined tower on a
rock above it, a promontory, and a
mountain ash waving its red berries.
He went home, and wove
the whole together into a poetical
description.” After a pause
Wordsworth resumed with a flashing
eye and impassioned voice:
“But nature does not permit an inventory
to be made of her charms!
He should have left his pencil and
note-book at home; fixed his eye,
as he walked, with a reverent attention
on all that surrounded him,
and taken all into a heart that could
understand and enjoy. Then, after
several days had passed by, he
should have interrogated his memory
as to the scene. He would have
discovered that while much of what
he had admired was preserved to
him, much was also most wisely obliterated.
That which remained&mdash;the
picture surviving in his mind&mdash;would
have presented the ideal and
essential truth of the scene, and
done so, in a large part, by discarding
much which, though in itself
striking, was not characteristic. In
every scene many of the most brilliant
details are but accidental. A
true eye for nature does not note
them, or at least does not dwell on
them.” On the same occasion he
remarked: “Scott misquoted in one
of his novels my lines on Yarrow.
He makes me write,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“‘The swans on sweet St. Mary’s lake</div>
<div class="verse">Float double, swans and shadow.’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">but I wrote,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“‘The <em>swan</em> on <em>still</em> St. Mary’s lake.’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Never could I have written
‘swans’ in the plural. The scene
when I saw it, with its still and
dim lake, under the dusky hills, was
one of utter loneliness; there was
<em>one</em> swan, and one only, stemming
the water, and the pathetic loneliness
of the region gave importance
to the one companion of that swan&mdash;its
own white image in the water.
It was for that reason that I recorded
the swan and the shadow. Had
there been many swans and many
shadows, they would have implied
nothing as regards the character of
the scene, and I should have said
nothing about them.” He proceeded
to remark that many who could
descant with eloquence on nature
cared little for her, and that many
more who truly loved her had yet
no eye to discern her&mdash;which he regarded
as a sort of “spiritual discernment.”
He continued: “Indeed,
I have hardly ever known any
one but myself who had a true eye
for nature&mdash;one that thoroughly understood
her meanings and her
teachings&mdash;except” (here he interrupted
himself) “one person.
There was a young clergyman
called Frederick Faber,<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> who resided
at Ambleside. He had not
only as good an eye for nature as I
have, but even a better one, and
sometimes pointed out to me on
the mountains effects which, with
all my great experience, I had never
detected.”</p>

<p>Truth, he used to say&mdash;that is,
truth in its largest sense, as a thing
at once real and ideal, a truth
including exact and accurate detail,
and yet everywhere subordinating
mere detail to the spirit of the
whole,&mdash;this, he affirmed, was the
soul and essence not only of descriptive
poetry, but of all poetry.
He had often, he told me, intended
to write an essay on poetry, setting
forth this principle, and illustrating
it by references to the chief representatives
of poetry in its various
departments. It was this twofold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
truth which made Shakspere
the greatest of all poets. “It was
well for Shakspere,” he remarked,
“that he gave himself to the
drama. It was that which forced
him to be sufficiently human. His
poems would otherwise, from the
extraordinarily metaphysical character
of his genius, have been too
recondite to be understood. His
youthful poems, in spite of their unfortunate
and unworthy subjects,
and his sonnets also, reveal this tendency.
Nothing can surpass the
greatness of Shakspere where he is
at his greatest; but it is wrong to
speak of him as if even he were perfect.
He had serious defects, and
not those only proceeding from
carelessness. For instance, in his
delineations of character he does
not assign as large a place to religious
sentiment as enters into the
constitution of human nature under
normal circumstances. If his
dramas had more religion in them,
they would be truer representations
of man, as well as more elevated
and of a more searching interest.”
Wordsworth used to warn young
poets against writing poetry remote
from human interest. Dante he
admitted to be an exception; but
he considered that Shelley, and almost
all others who had endeavored
to outsoar the humanities, had
suffered deplorably from the attempt.
I once heard him say: “I
have often been asked for advice
by young poets. All the advice I
can give may be expressed in two
counsels. First, let nature be your
habitual and pleasurable study&mdash;human
nature and material nature;
secondly, study carefully those first-class
poets whose fame is universal,
not local, and learn from them;
learn from them especially how to
observe and how to interpret nature.”</p>

<p>Those who knew Wordsworth
only from his poetry might have
supposed that he dwelt ever in a
region too serene to admit of human
agitations. This was not the
fact. There was in his being a region
of tumult as well a higher region
of calm, though it was almost
wholly in the latter that his poetry
lived. It turned aside from mere
<em>personal</em> excitements; and for that
reason, doubtless, it developed more
deeply those special ardors which
belong at once to the higher imagination
and to the moral being.
The passion which was suppressed
elsewhere burned in his “Sonnets
to Liberty,” and added a deeper
sadness to the “Yew-trees of Borrowdale.”
But his heart, as well
as his imagination, was ardent.
When it spoke most powerfully in
his poetry, it spoke with a stern
brevity unusual in that poetry, as
in the poem, “There is a change,
and I am poor,” and the still more
remarkable one, “A slumber did
my spirit seal”&mdash;a poem impassioned
beyond the comprehension of
those who fancy that Wordsworth
lacks passion, merely because in
him passion is neither declamatory
nor, latently, sensual. He was a
man of strong affections&mdash;strong
enough on one sorrowful occasion
to withdraw him for a time from
poetry.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Referring once to two
young children of his who had died
about forty years previously, he
described the details of their illnesses
with an exactness and an
impetuosity of troubled excitement
such as might have been expected
if the bereavement had taken place
but a few weeks before. The lapse
of time appeared to have left the
sorrow submerged indeed, but still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
in all its first freshness. Yet I afterwards
heard that at the time of the
illness, at least in the case of one
of the two children, it was impossible
to rouse his attention to the
danger. He chanced to be then
under the immediate spell of one
of those fits of poetic inspiration
which descended on him like a
cloud. Till the cloud had drifted
he could see nothing beyond. Under
the level of the calm there was,
however, the precinct of the storm.
It expressed itself rarely but vehemently,
partaking sometimes of the
character both of indignation and
sorrow. All at once the trouble
would pass away and his countenance
bask in its habitual calm,
like a cloudless summer sky. His
indignation flamed out vehemently
when he heard of a base action.
“I could kick such a man across
England with my naked foot,” I
heard him exclaim on such an occasion.
The more impassioned
part of his nature connected itself
especially with his political feelings.
He regarded his own intellect as
one which united some of the faculties
which belong to the statesman
with those which belong to
the poet; and public affairs interested
him not less deeply than poetry.
It was as patriot, not poet,
that he ventured to claim fellowship
with Dante.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> He did not accept
the term “reformer,” because
it implied an organic change in our
institutions, and this he deemed
both needless and dangerous; but
he used to say that, while he was a
decided conservative, he remembered
that to preserve our institutions
we must be ever improving
them. He was, indeed, from first
to last, pre-eminently a patriot&mdash;an
impassioned as well as a thoughtful
one. Yet his political sympathies
were not with his own country only,
but with the progress of humanity.
Till disenchanted by the excesses
and follies of the first French Revolution,
his hopes and sympathies
associated themselves ardently with
the new order of things created by
it; and I have heard him say that
he did not know how any generous-minded
<em>young</em> man, entering on life
at the time of that great uprising,
could have escaped the illusion.
To the end his sympathies were
ever with the cottage hearth far
more than with the palace. If he
became a strong supporter of what
has been called “the hierarchy of
society,” it was chiefly because he
believed the principle of “equality”
to be fatal to the well-being and
the true dignity of the poor. Moreover,
in siding politically with the
crown and the coronets, he considered
himself to be siding with
the weaker party in our democratic
days.</p>

<p>The absence of love-poetry in
Wordsworth’s works has often been
remarked upon, and indeed brought
as a charge against them. He once
told me that if he had avoided that
form of composition, it was by no
means because the theme did not
interest him, but because, treated
as it commonly has been, it tends
rather to disturb and lower the
reader’s moral and imaginative
being than to elevate it. He
feared to handle it amiss. He
seemed to think that the subject
had been so long vulgarized that
few poets had a right to assume
that they could treat it worthily,
especially as the theme, when treated
unworthily, was such an easy
and cheap way of winning applause.
It has been observed also
that the religion of Wordsworth’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
poetry, at least of his earlier poetry,
is not as distinctly “revealed
religion” as might have been expected
from this poet’s well-known
adherence to what he has called
emphatically “The lord, and mighty
paramount of truths.” He once remarked
to me himself on this circumstance,
and explained it by
stating that when in youth his imagination
was shaping for itself the
channel in which it was to flow, his
religious convictions were less definite
and less strong than they had
become on more mature thought;
and that, when his poetic mind and
manner had once been formed, he
feared that he might, in attempting
to modify them, have become constrained.
He added that on such
matters he ever wrote with great
diffidence, remembering that if
there were many subjects too low
for song, there were some too high.
Wordsworth’s general confidence in
his own powers, which was strong,
though far from exaggerated, rendered
more striking and more
touching his humility in all that
concerned religion. It used to remind
me of what I once heard Mr.
Rogers say, viz.: “There is a special
character of <em>greatness</em> about humility;
for it implies that a man can, in
an unusual degree, estimate the
<em>greatness</em> of what is above us.”
Fortunately, his diffidence did not
keep Wordsworth silent on sacred
themes. His later poems include
an unequivocal as well as beautiful
confession of Christian faith; and
one of them, “The Primrose of the
Rock,” is as distinctly Wordsworthian
in its inspiration as it is Christian
in its doctrine. Wordsworth
was a “High-Churchman,” and also,
in his prose mind, strongly anti-Roman
Catholic, partly on political
grounds; but that it was otherwise
as regards his mind poetic is obvious
from many passages in his Christian
poetry, especially those which
refer to the monastic system and
the Schoolmen, and his sonnet on
the Blessed Virgin, whom he addresses
as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Our tainted nature’s solitary boast.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He used to say that the idea of
one who was both Virgin and
Mother had sunk so deep into the
heart of humanity that there it
must ever remain.</p>

<p>Wordsworth’s estimate of his
contemporaries was not generally
high. I remember his once saying
to me: “I have known many that
might be called very <em>clever</em> men,
and a good many of real and vigorous
<em>abilities</em>, but few of genius;
and only one whom I should call
‘wonderful.’ That one was Coleridge.
At any hour of the day or
night he would talk by the hour, if
there chanced to be <em>any</em> sympathetic
listener, and talk better than the
best page of his writings; for a
pen half paralyzed his genius. A
child would sit quietly at his feet
and wonder, till the torrent had
passed by. The only man like
Coleridge whom I have known is
Sir William Hamilton, Astronomer
Royal of Dublin.” I remember,
however, that when I recited by
his fireside Alfred Tennyson’s two
political poems, “You ask me why,
though ill at ease,” and “Of old sat
Freedom on the heights,” the old
bard listened with a deepening attention,
and, when I had ended,
said after a pause, “I must acknowledge
that those two poems are
very solid and noble in thought.
Their diction also seems singularly
stately.” He was a great admirer
of Philip van Artevelde. In the
case of a certain poet since dead,
and little popular, he said to me:
“I consider his sonnets to be certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
the best of modern times”;
adding, “Of course I am not including
my own in any comparison
with those of others.” He was not
sanguine as to the future of English
poetry. He thought that there
was much to be supplied in other
departments of our literature, and
especially he desired a really great
history of England; but he was
disposed to regard the roll of English
poetry as made up, and as
leaving place for little more except
what was likely to be eccentric or
imitational.</p>

<p>In his younger days Wordsworth
had had to fight a great battle in
poetry; for both his subjects and
his mode of treating them were
antagonistic to the maxims then
current. It was fortunate for posterity,
no doubt, that his long “militant
estate” was animated by some
mingling of personal ambition with
his love of poetry. Speaking in an
early sonnet of</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The poets, who on earth have made us heirs</div>
<div class="verse">Of truth, and pure delight, by heavenly lays,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">he concludes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Oh! might my name be numbered among theirs,</div>
<div class="verse">Then gladly would I end my mortal days.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He died at eighty, and general
fame did not come to him till about
fifteen years before his death. This
might perhaps have been fifteen
years too soon, if he had set any
inordinate value on it. But it was
not so. Shelley tells us that “Fame
is love disguised”; and it was intellectual
sympathy that Wordsworth
had always valued far more than
reputation. “Give me thy love; I
claim no other fee,” had been his
demand on his reader. When fame
had laid her tardy garland at his
feet, he found on it no fresher green
than his “Rydalian laurels” had
always worn. Once he said to me:
“It is indeed a deep satisfaction to
hope and believe that my poetry
will be, while it lasts, a help to the
cause of virtue and truth, especially
among the young. As for myself,
it seems now of little moment
how long I may be remembered.
When a man pushes off in his little
boat into the great seas of Infinity
and Eternity, it surely signifies
little how long he is kept in sight
by watchers from the shore.”</p>

<p>Such are my chief recollections
of the great poet, whom I knew but
in his old age, but whose heart retained
its youth till his daughter
Dora’s death. He seemed to me
one who from boyhood had been
faithful to a high vocation; one
who had esteemed it his office to
minister, in an age of conventional
civilization, at nature’s altar, and
who had in his later life explained
and vindicated such lifelong ministration,
even while he seemed to
apologize for it, in the memorable
confession,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“But who is innocent? By grace divine,</div>
<div class="verse">Not otherwise, O Nature! are we thine.”<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was to nature as first created,
not to nature as corrupted by “disnatured”
passions, that his song
had attributed such high and healing
powers. In singing her praise
he had chosen a theme loftier than
most of his readers knew&mdash;loftier,
as he perhaps eventually discovered,
than he had at first supposed it
to be. Utterly without Shakspere’s
dramatic faculty, he was richer and
wider in the humanities than any
poet since Shakspere. Wholly unlike
Milton in character and in
opinions, he abounds in passages to
be paralleled only by Milton in
solemn and spiritual sublimity, and
not even by Milton in pathos. It
was plain to those who knew
Wordsworth that he had kept his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
great gift pure, and used it honestly
and thoroughly for that purpose
for which it had been bestowed.
He had ever written with a conscientious
reverence for that gift;
but he had also written spontaneously.
He had composed with
care&mdash;not the exaggerated solicitude
which is prompted by vanity,
and which frets itself to unite incompatible
excellences, but the
diligence which shrinks from no
toil while eradicating blemishes
that confuse a poem’s meaning and
frustrate its purpose. He regarded
poetry as an art; but he also regarded
art, not as the compeer of
nature, much less her superior, but
as her servant and interpreter. He
wrote poetry likewise, no doubt, in
a large measure, because self-utterance
was an essential law of his
nature. If he had a companion,
he discoursed like one whose
thoughts must needs run on in audible
current; if he walked alone
among his mountains, he murmured
old songs. He was like a pine-grove,
vocal as well as visible. But
to poetry he had dedicated himself
as to the utterance of the highest
truths brought within the range of
his life’s experience; and if his
poetry has been accused of egotism,
the charge has come from those
who did not perceive that it was
with a human, not a mere personal,
interest that he habitually watched
the processes of his own mind. He
drew from the fountain that was
nearest at hand what he hoped
might be a refreshment to those
far off. He once said, speaking of
a departed man of genius, who had
lived an unhappy life and deplorably
abused his powers, to the lasting
calamity of his country: “A
great poet must be a great man;
and a great man must be a good
man; and a good man ought to be
a happy man.” To know Wordsworth
was to feel sure that if he had
been a great poet, it was not merely
because he had been endowed with
a great imagination, but because he
had been a good man, a great man,
and a man whose poetry had, in an
especial sense, been the expression
of a healthily happy moral being.</p>

<p><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;Wordsworth was by no
means without humor. When the
Queen, on one occasion, gave a
masked ball, some one said that a
certain youthful poet, who has since
reached a deservedly high place
both in the literary and political
world, but who was then known
chiefly as an accomplished and
amusing young man of society, was
to attend it dressed in the character
of the father of English poetry&mdash;grave
old Chaucer. “What!” said
Wordsworth, “M&mdash;&mdash; go as Chaucer!
Then it only remains for me
to go as M&mdash;&mdash;!”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The above-written sonnet is the
record of a delightful day spent by
my father in 1833 with Wordsworth
at Rydal, to which he went from
the still more beautiful shores of
Ulswater, where he had been sojourning
at Halsteads. He had
been one of Wordsworth’s warmest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
admirers when their number was
small, and in 1842 he dedicated a
volume of poems to him.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> He
taught me when a boy of eighteen
years old to admire the great bard.
I had been very enthusiastically
praising Lord Byron’s poetry. My
father calmly replied: “Wordsworth
is the great poet of modern times.”
Much surprised, I asked: “And
what may his special merits be?”
The answer was, “They are very various;
as, for instance, depth, largeness,
elevation, and, what is rare in
modern poetry, an <em>entire</em> purity.
In his noble ‘Laodamia’ they are
chiefly majesty and pathos.” A few
weeks afterwards I chanced to take
from the library shelves a volume
of Wordsworth, and it opened on
“Laodamia.” Some strong, calm
hand seemed to have been laid on
my head, and bound me to the spot
till I had come to the end. As I
read, a new world, hitherto unimagined,
opened itself out, stretching
far away into serene infinitudes.
The region was one to me unknown,
but the harmony of the picture
attested its reality. Above and
around were indeed</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“An ampler ether, a diviner air,</div>
<div class="verse">And fields invested with purpureal gleams”;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and when I reached the line,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Calm pleasures there abide&mdash;majestic pains,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I felt that no tenants less stately
could walk in so lordly a precinct.
I had been translated into another
planet of song&mdash;one with larger
movements and a longer year. A
wider conception of poetry had become
mine, and the Byronian enthusiasm
fell from me like a bond
that is broken by being outgrown.
The incident illustrates poetry in
one of its many characters&mdash;that of
the “deliverer.” The ready sympathies
and inexperienced imagination
of youth make it surrender
itself easily despite its better aspirations,
or in consequence of them,
to a false greatness; and the true
greatness, once revealed, sets it
free. As early as 1824 Walter Savage
Landor, in his “Imaginary Conversation”
between Southey and
Porson, had pronounced Wordsworth’s
“Laodamia” to be “a composition
such as Sophocles might
have exulted to own, and a part of
which might have been heard with
shouts of rapture in the regions he
describes”&mdash;the Elysian Fields.</p>

<p>Wordsworth frequently spoke of
death, as if it were the taking of a
new degree in the University of
Life. “I should like,” he remarked
to a young lady, “to visit Italy
again before I move to another
planet.” He sometimes made a
mistake in assuming that others
were equally philosophical. We
were once breakfasting at the house
of Mr. Rogers, when Wordsworth,
after gazing attentively round the
room with a benignant and complacent
expression, turned to our
host, and, wishing to compliment
him, said: “Mr. Rogers, I never see
this house, so perfect in its taste,
so exquisite in all its arrangements,
and decorated with such well-chosen
pictures, without fancying it
the very house imaged to himself
by the Roman poet when, in illustration
of man’s mortality, he says:
‘Linquenda est domus.’” “What
is that you’re saying?” replied Mr.
Rogers, whose years between eighty
and ninety, had not improved his
hearing. “I was remarking that
your house,” replied Wordsworth,
“always reminds me of the ode
(more properly called an elegy,
though doubtless the lyrical measure
not unnaturally causes it to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
included among Horace’s odes)
in which the Roman poet writes:
‘Linquenda est domus’; that is,
since, ladies being present, a translation
may be deemed desirable,
<em>The house is</em>, or <em>has to be, left</em>; and
again,’et placens uxor’&mdash;and the
pleasing wife; though, as we must
all regret, that part of the quotation
is not applicable on the present
occasion.” The Town Bard, on
whom “no angle smiled” more than
the end of St. James’ Place, did
not enter into the views of the Bard
of the Mountains. His answer was
what children call “making a great
face,” and the ejaculation, “Don’t
talk Latin in the society of ladies.”
When I was going away, he remarked,
“What a stimulus the mountain
air has on the appetite! I made a
sign to Edmund to hand him the
cutlets a second time. I was afraid
he would stick his fork into that
beautiful woman who sat next
him.” Wordsworth never resented
a jest at his own expense. Once
when we had knocked three times
in vain at the door of a London
house, I exclaimed, quoting his sonnet
written on Westminster Bridge,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Dear God, the very houses seem asleep.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He laughed heartily, then smiled
gravely, and lastly recounted
the occasion and described the
early morning on which that sonnet
was written. He did not recite
more than a part of it, to the accompaniment
of distant cab and
carriage; and I thought that the
door was opened too soon.</p>

<p>Wordsworth, despite his dislike
to great cities, was attracted occasionally
in his later years</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“To the proud margin of the Thames</div>
<div class="verse">And Lambeth’s venerable towers,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">where his society was courted by
persons of the most different character.
But he complained bitterly
of the great city. It was next to
impossible, he remarked, to tell the
truth in it. “Yesterday I was at
S&mdash;&mdash; House; the Duchess of S&mdash;&mdash;,
showing me the pictures, observed:
‘This is the portrait of my brother’
(naming him), ‘and it is considered
very like.’ To this I assented,
partly perhaps in absence of
mind, but partly, I think, with an
impression that her grace’s brother
was probably a person whose face
every one knew or was expected
to know; so that, as I had never
met him, my answer was in fact a
lie! It is too bad that, when more
than seventy years old, I should be
drawn from the mountains to London
in order to tell a lie!” He
made his complaint wherever he
went, laying the blame, however, not
so much on himself or on the
duchess as on the corrupt city;
and some of those who learned how
the most truthful man in England
had thus quickly been subverted
by metropolitan snares came to the
conclusion that within a few years
more no virtue would be left extant
in the land. He was likewise maltreated
in lesser ways. “This
morning I was compelled by my
engagements to eat three breakfasts&mdash;one
with an aged and excellent
gentleman, who may justly be esteemed
an accomplished man of
letters, although I cannot honestly
concede to him the title of a poet;
one at a fashionable party; and
one with an old friend whom no
pressure would induce me to
neglect, although for this, my first
breakfast to-day, I was obliged
to name the early hour of seven
o’clock, as he lives in a remote part
of London.”</p>

<p>But it was only among his own
mountains that Wordsworth could
be understood. He walked among
them not so much to admire them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
as to converse with them. They
exchanged thoughts with him, in
sunshine or flying shadow, giving
him their own and accepting his.
Day and night, at all hours, and
in all weathers, he would face them.
If it rained, he might fling his
plaid over him, but would take no
admonition. He must have his
way. On such occasions, dutiful
as he was in higher matters, he
remained incurably wayward. In
vain one reminded him that a letter
needed an answer or that the
storm would soon be over. It was
very necessary for him to do what
he liked; and one of his dearest
friends said to me, with a smile of
the most affectionate humor: “He
wrote his ‘Ode to Duty,’ and then
he had done with that matter.”
This very innocent form of lawlessness,
corresponding with the classic
expression, “Indulge genio,”
seemed to belong to his genius, not
less than the sympathetic reverence
with which he looked up to the higher
and universal laws. Sometimes
there was a battle between his reverence
for nature and his reverence
for other things. The friend already
alluded to was once remarking
on his varying expressions of
countenance: “That rough old
face is capable of high and real
beauty; I have seen in it an expression
quite of heavenly peace
and contemplative delight, as the
May breeze came over him from
the woods while he was slowly
walking out of church on a Sunday
morning, and when he had half
emerged from the shadow.” A
flippant person present inquired:
“Did you ever chance, Miss F&mdash;&mdash;,
to observe that heavenly expression
on his countenance as he was walking
into church on a fine May
morning?” A laugh was the reply.
The ways of nature harmonized
with his feelings in age as well as
in youth. He could understand no
estrangement. Gathering a wreath
of white thorn on one occasion,
he murmured, as he slipped it
into the ribbon which bound the
golden tresses of his youthful companion,</p>

<h3>SIR THOMAS MORE.<br />
<i>A HISTORICAL ROMANCE.</i></h3>

<p class="center">FROM THE FRENCH OF THE PRINCESSE DE CRAON.</p>

<h4>III.</h4>

<p>“Ah! well, and so you are going
to carry the French birds back!”
exclaimed the old keeper Jack, with
a loud, coarse laugh, as he leaned
against one of the century-old trees
in Windsor forest. “Well, well,
so be it, my friends; but give us a
little drop to drink,” he added in
a jocular but self-important tone.
As he said these words, he familiarly
slapped the shoulder of one of
the falconers, who was engaged in
fastening the chains again to the
feet of the tiercelets, whilst his comrades
cut off the heads of the game
taken, and threw them as a reward
to the cruel birds, who devoured
them with avidity.</p>

<p>“After a while,” replied the falconer
a little impatiently. “Wait
till our work is done, father Jack;
you are always in a hurry&mdash;to drink.
We will take our glass together
now directly. See that troop of
birds! They must first be chained
and put with the others.”</p>

<p>“Well, well!” replied Jack, “provided
we lose nothing by waiting.
These are beautiful birds, if
they do come from France.”</p>

<p>“No, no, you shall lose nothing
by waiting,” cried the second falconer.
“Come here; I will let you
taste a liquid that these birds have
brought over under their wings, and
we will see then if you have ever
drunk anything equal to it since
you drew on your boots in the service
of his majesty.”</p>

<p>And he poured out of a canteen
that hung from his shoulder-belt a
very acid gin, filling, until it foamed
over, a large pewter cup, which
he handed to father Jack.</p>

<p>It was swallowed at one draught.</p>

<p>“Oh! superb, superb!” cried the
old keeper, returning the cup and
smacking his lips. “During the five-and-forty
years past that I have had
the honor of keeping Windsor, I
have drunk nothing better. Let’s
go! That strengthens a man’s courage
and warms up his old blood! I
believe the deer will give us a hard
drive to-day; I have seen the tracks
of fourteen or fifteen at least.” And
saying this, he remounted his old
wind-broken mare.</p>

<p>“Wait, father Jack, wait for us!
We will all go together,” exclaimed
the <i lang="fr">gens de l’equipage</i>; for Jack contributed
much to their amusement.
When they had mounted their
horses, they followed the keeper,
getting off a hundred jokes on the
old mare, to which he was much attached.</p>

<p>They very soon passed by two
young lords who had halted near
the verge of the forest, and were
engaged in conversation.</p>

<p>One of them held in leash four
beautiful greyhounds, especial favorites
of the king because of their
great sagacity and swiftness in the
chase. Their keeper, however, was
obliged to use the lash, in order to
stop their clamorous baying.</p>

<p>“You have seen her, then?” he
remarked to his companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I have seen her down yonder.
She crossed the road with all
of her ladies,” replied the latter, who
belonged to Wolsey’s household
and wore his livery. “She was
dressed in a black velvet cap and
green riding-habit and she is really
charming!”</p>

<p>“Well, my poor friend,” replied
the other, “but do you know I have
serious fears that your cardinal will
soon fall into disfavor? But a moment
ago, as they passed by here, I
heard the Duke of Norfolk remark
to a lady that the red cloak was
decidedly out of style, and altogether
it was at this time so completely
used up that he did not think it
could ever again be mended. The
lady smiled maliciously, and said
he was right&mdash;she believed the
green mantle would eventually end
by tearing the red to pieces! And
pointing to the young Anne Boleyn,
who was not far off, she made a
sign that left no doubt on my mind
it was that lady she meant to designate
as the destroyer.”</p>

<p>“Truly,” replied the young domestic,<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
“what you tell me is anything
but encouraging. And so our
dear duke must have <em>his</em> finger in
the pie! I shall be very sorry for
all this if it happens, because my
own clothes, are made of scarlet,
you see; and when one has succeeded,
in the course of time, in getting
a suit well made up, he doesn’t like
the trouble of having to commence
again and make it over.”</p>

<p>As he said this a cloud of dust
arose, and a troop of horsemen
passed at full gallop and with a terrible
hue and cry.</p>

<p>“My dogs! my dogs!” cried
the king in the midst of the crowd.
“Let loose my dogs! The deer
makes for the ponds. Let them hasten
to tell the ladies, that they may
be in at the death.”</p>

<p>He disappeared like a flash of
lightning, of which we obtain but a
glimpse ere it is gone. The shrill
notes of the hunter’s horn resounded
from afar, awaking countless
echoes through the forest.</p>

<p>“Let us go,” exclaimed the two
young men simultaneously. “We
will then get rid of these accursed
hounds.”</p>

<p>“To the ponds! To the ponds!”
they cried. “The ladies, to the
ponds! The ladies, to the ponds!”
And they started on, laughing and
shouting.</p>

<p>“What is that you are shouting
down there?” cried a huntsman
from a distance, whose horse had
just made him roll in the dust.</p>

<p>“To the ponds! My lord, to
the ponds!” they cried.</p>

<p>The retinue surrounding the Duke
of Suffolk put whip to their horses
and followed in a sweeping gallop.
From every side of the hills surrounding
these ponds there appeared,
at the same moment, troops
of eager hunters, panting and covered
with dust. The different roads
traversing the forest in every direction
converged and met on the
banks of the ponds that slept in
the basin thus formed.</p>

<p>The ladies had already assembled,
and nothing could have been
more entertaining than the rapid
and eager movements of the remainder
of the hunters as they
came galloping up. The king arrived
before any of the others.
He excelled in exercises of this
kind, and took great delight in
ending the chase in a brilliant
manner by shooting the deer himself.
On this occasion he had decided
that, contrary to the usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
custom, it should be taken alive;
consequently, they hastened to
spread in every direction the nets
and fillets.</p>

<p>In this case the skill of the hunters
consisted in driving the game
into the snare.</p>

<p>Very soon the deer made his appearance,
followed by a multitude
of hounds, who pursued him so furiously,
and crowded so closely one
against the other, that, to use a
familiar expression of the hunters,
they could have been covered with
a table-cloth.</p>

<p>At sight of the nets the beautiful
animal paused for an instant. He
shook his horns menacingly, and
stamped the ground with his feet;
then suddenly, feeling already the
scorching breath of the infuriated
pack of hounds about to seize him,
he made a desperate effort, and,
leaping at a single bound the entire
height of the fillets, threw himself
into the lake. Instantly a loud and
deafening shout arose, while the
furious hounds, arrested in their
course by the nets, uttered the most
frightful howlings on seeing their
prey escape.</p>

<p>“My cross-bow!” cried the king.
“Quick! my cross-bow!” and he
drew it so skilfully that at the first
shot he pierced the flank of the
poor animal, who immediately ceased
to swim.</p>

<p>Satisfied with his brilliant success,
the king, after having heard
the plaudits of the ladies and received
the congratulations of the
hunters, proceeded to the pavilion,
constructed of evergreens and foliage,
as elegant as it was spacious,
which he had had erected in the
midst of the forest, in order to dine
under cover.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Suffolk did the
honors of the festival, taking the
place of Queen Catherine, who,
under the pretext of bad health, declined
appearing at these hunting
parties, the noisy sports having become
insupportable to her.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the courtiers were
greatly excited by observing a roll
of paper the extremity of which
projected from the right pocket of
the king’s hunting-jacket; on one
of the leaves, a corner of which was
turned down, two words were visible&mdash;the
name of “Wolsey” and
that of “traitor.” Each one sought
to approach the king or pass behind
him in order to assure himself
of the astonishing fact, of which
they had the temerity to whisper
mysteriously together.</p>

<p>But in spite of all their efforts,
they were unable to discover anything
more; the day and the festival
ended with numerous conjectures&mdash;the
fears and hopes excited
in the minds of that court where
for so long the learned favorite had
ruled with as much authority as
the king himself.</p>

<p class="break">At daybreak on the morning succeeding
the festival the gates were
thrown open, and a carriage, bearing
the royal arms and colors, drove
from the great courtyard of Windsor
Palace.</p>

<p>While the postilion trotted leisurely
along, looking around from
time to time as he wonderingly reflected
why the horse on his right
grew constantly lean in spite of the
generous addition he had made to
his rations, the two occupants of
the carriage engaged in the following
conversation:</p>

<p>“It is cold this morning,” said
one of them, wrapping his cloak
more closely about him.</p>

<p>“Yes; and how this fog and the
heavy dew covering the earth remind
one of the bivouac!”</p>

<p>“It does indeed,” responded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
Norfolk to his companion; “but
such souvenirs are always agreeable,
and carry us back to the happiest
days of life&mdash;years spent amid the
tumult and vicissitudes of the camp.
Eighteen! that impulsive, impetuous
age, when presumptuous courage
rushes headlong into danger, comprehending
nothing of death; when
reckless intrepidity permits not a
moment’s reflection or hesitation,
transported by the ardent desire of
acquiring glory; the intoxicating
happiness of a first success&mdash;such
are the thrilling emotions, the brilliant
illusions of youth, which we
shall experience no more!” And
the old warrior sorrowfully bowed
his head.</p>

<p>“Ah! well, others replace them,”
replied Suffolk.</p>

<p>“Yes, to be displaced and disappear
in their turn,” answered the
duke, brushing back the white
locks the wind had blown over his
forehead, on which appeared a deep
scar.</p>

<p>“Well, my lord,” exclaimed the
Duke of Suffolk, “do not spoil, by
your philosophic reflections, all the
pleasure we ought to enjoy in the
thought that, thanks to the influence
and good management of
your charming niece, we are now
going to inform Monseigneur Wolsey
that the time has at last arrived
for him to abdicate his portion of
the crown.”</p>

<p>“Yes, perhaps so,” replied the
duke. “And yet I don’t know.
Yesterday, even, I detested this
man, and desired most ardently his
ruin; to-day&mdash;no, no; an enemy
vanquished and prostrate at my
feet inspires only compassion.
Now I almost regret the injury my
niece has done him and the blow
she has struck.”</p>

<p>“Come, come, my lord, do you
not know that an excess of generosity
becomes a fault? We have
nothing to regret,” continued Suffolk,
with an exulting laugh. “I
only hope he may not be acquitted
(and thus be able to settle the
scores with us afterwards); that
Parliament will show him no mercy.
Death alone can effectually remove
him. The little memorandum you
have there contains enough to
hang all the chancellors in the
world.”</p>

<p>“It is very certain,” replied the
Duke of Norfolk, abstractedly turning
the leaves of the book he held
in his hand (the same that had excited
such eager curiosity among
the courtiers)&mdash;“it is certain this
book contains grave accusations.
Nevertheless, I do not think it has
entirely accomplished the end proposed
by the author.”</p>

<p>“In truth, no,” answered Suffolk;
“for Wiltshire counted very
certainly on replacing Wolsey. He
will be astounded when he learns
of the choice of the king.”</p>

<p>“Although Wiltshire is a relative
of mine,” replied the duke, “I am
compelled to acknowledge that it
would have been impossible for
the king to have made a better selection
or avoided a worse one.
Wiltshire is both ignorant and
ambitious, while Thomas More has
no superior in learning and merit.
I knew him when quite a child, living
with the distinguished Cardinal
Morton, who was particularly attached
to him. I remember very
often at table Morton speaking
of him to us, and always saying:
‘This young boy will make an extraordinary
man. You will see it.
I shall not be living, but you will
then recall the prediction of an old
man.’”</p>

<p>“Extraordinary!” replied Suffolk
in his habitual tone of raillery;
“most extraordinary! We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
are promised, then, a chancellor of
a peculiar species! I suppose he
will not be the least astonished at
receiving so high and singular a
favor. But, the devil! he will
need to be a wonderful man. If
he sustains himself on the throne
ministerial, he will find a superior
degree of wisdom necessary. Between
the king, the queen, the
council, Wiltshire, the Parliament,
the clergy, and the people, I would
not risk my little finger, brother-in-law
of his majesty although I
have the honor to be.”</p>

<p>And he began laughing as he
looked at Norfolk, although, out of
deference to him, he had not included
in the list of difficulties the
most formidable of all, and the one
that carried all others in its train&mdash;his
niece, Mlle. Anne.</p>

<p>“In the sense you use the word,”
the duke answered coldly, “I believe,
on the contrary, he is by no
means an astute man. The intrigues
of court will be altogether foreign
to his character; but otherwise, in
science and learning, he has no
equal. He is in possession of all
that a man is capable of acquiring
in that direction, and no man has
made a more profound study of the
common law and the statutes of
the kingdom. Morton placed him
at Oxford, then at the Chancellors’
College at Lincoln, and he achieved
the most brilliant success.”</p>

<p>“Admirable!” exclaimed Suffolk,
laughing.</p>

<p>“Since that time,” pursued the
Duke of Norfolk, “his reputation
has continued to increase. When
he lectured in S. Lawrence’s Church,
the celebrated Dr. Grocyn and all
of our London <i lang="fr">savants</i> crowded
eagerly to hear him.”</p>

<p>“Well! well! I knew nothing
of these most agreeable particulars,”
said Suffolk; “I only knew
that it was he who induced Parliament
to refuse the subsidy demanded
for the Queen of Scots. If he
continues to repeat such exploits
as that, I venture to predict he will
not be chancellor very long.”</p>

<p>“Oh! as to that,” replied the
duke, “he is a man who will never
compromise his conscience. Yes,
yes, I recall distinctly the enraged
expression of the present king’s
father when Mr. Tyler came to
inform him that the House of
Commons had rejected his demand,
and a beardless youth had
been the cause of it. I have not
forgotten, either, that Henry VII.,
of happy memory, well knew how
to avenge himself by having an
enormous fine imposed on Sir
Thomas’ father.”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied Suffolk, “but it
was not always expedient for the
House of Commons to raise money
in that way.”</p>

<p>The conversation was continued
in this manner, as the hours glided
by, until at length the glittering
spires of the London churches appeared
in the distance, and very
soon the carriage had entered the
narrow, gloomy streets of that great
city.</p>

<p class="break">Just at this time the soul of Wolsey
was replenished with an inexpressible
quietude and contentment.
“At last,” he said to himself, “my
enemies have all been confounded.
I can no longer entertain a doubt
respecting my power, after the most
gracious manner in which the king
has treated me at Grafton. I trust
the influence of Anne Boleyn has
diminished in the same proportion
that mine has increased. Now she
wants Sir Thomas Cheney recalled;
but I shall not consent to that.
Campeggio goes loaded with honorable
presents. The influence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
the mistress will soon cease, and
that ambitious fool Wiltshire will
lose the fruit of his intrigues.…”
As the Cardinal of York consoled
himself with these agreeable reflections,
the arrival of the Venetian
ambassador was announced.</p>

<p>“Ah! so he presents himself at
last,” Wolsey exclaimed. “He has
been a long time demanding an
audience!” And he ordered him
to be introduced.</p>

<p>Wolsey received him in the most
gracious manner. After the usual
compliments were exchanged, he
proposed showing him the honors
of the palace. He had spent his
life in embellishing and adorning
it with wonderful treasures of industry
and art, of which he was
the enlightened and generous protector,
bestowing on them from
his own purse the most liberal encouragement.</p>

<p>Numerous galleries, in which an
exquisite taste had evidently directed
even the most trivial ornamentation,
were filled with paintings,
statues, and precious antique
vases. Superb Flanders tapestries
gleamed on all sides, covered the
panels, were disposed around the
windows, and fell in heavy drapery
before the openings of the doors to
conceal the entrance. These precious
cloths, then of inestimable
value, were only found in the palaces
of kings. They usually represented
some historical or poetical
subject; and sometimes landscapes
and the rarest flowers were wrought
and tinted with reflections of gold.
Finally, Wolsey took occasion to
point out, among all these treasures,
the presents he had received at
different times from the various
princes of Europe who had sought
to secure his influence.</p>

<p>Charmed with the order, taste,
and beauty that reigned throughout
the palace, the Italian admired
everything, surprised to find in this
foreign clime a condition of luxury
that recalled the memory, always
pleasing, yet sometimes sad, of his
own country.</p>

<p>“Alas!” he exclaimed at length,
“we also were rich and happy, and
reposed in peace and security in
our palaces, before this war in which
we have been so unfortunate as to
rely on the King of France for assistance.
He has abandoned us;
and now, compelled to pay an enormous
tribute, the republic finds itself
humiliated in the dust beneath
the sceptre of the haughty emperor!”</p>

<p>“Such is the right of the conqueror,”
replied Wolsey. “You
are fortunate, inasmuch as he is
forced to use that right with moderation.”</p>

<p>“It seems a heavy burden to
us, this moderation!” replied the
ambassador. “He not only exacts
immense sums of money, but compels
us to surrender territory we
have conquered with our blood.
Florence is placed under the dominion
of the Medici, and all of our
Italian princes are reduced to a
condition of entire dependence.”</p>

<p>“Which, of course, they will
shake off at the first opportunity,”
interrupted Wolsey. “Charles V. is
too shrewd not to foresee that. Be
assured he will endeavor to secure
your good-will, because your support
is indispensable to enable him
to resist the formidable power of
the Sultan Soliman, and the invasions
of the barbarians subject to
his authority.”</p>

<p>“In that we have placed our last
hope. If our services can be made
available, then from vanquished
enemies we may become united
allies. Already the emperor foresees
it; for he overwhelms Andrew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
Doria and the republic of Genoa
with favors. He seems to have forgotten
the injuries he suffered from
Sforza; he received him most affably
at court, and promised him the
Princess of Denmark, his niece, in
marriage.”</p>

<p>“I am informed,” said Wolsey,
“that he is deeply afflicted by the
death of the Prince of Orange.”</p>

<p>“Very much,” replied the ambassador.
“The prince was a valiant
captain. He leaves no children;
his titles and landed property
will descend to the children of his
sister Rénée, the Countess of Nassau.”</p>

<p>“And they are all German
princes who have thrown themselves
headlong into the Lutheran
heresy. They will endeavor to cast
off the yoke of the emperor, and become
altogether independent.”</p>

<p>“They have no other intention,”
replied the ambassador; “and by
separating from the Church of
Rome they hope more surely to
effect their purpose. However, the
decree laid before the diet against
the religious innovations has passed
by a large majority.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Wolsey; “but you
see the Elector of Saxony, the Marquis
of Brandenburg, the Landgrave
of Hesse, the Dukes of
Luneburg, and the Prince d’Anhalt
are all leagued against the
church, with the deputies of fourteen
imperial cities, and are designated
by no other name than that
of Protestant.”</p>

<p>“I am aware of that,” replied
the ambassador. “It will greatly
increase the difficulties in carrying
out the emperor’s secret project,”
he continued after a moment’s silence.
“Perhaps, however, he may
succeed in making the crown hereditary
in his family.”</p>

<p>“That is what we shall have to
prevent!” cried Wolsey vehemently,
who, at the words of the ambassador,
felt all his old hatred toward
Charles V. revive. “We will never
suffer it, neither will France. No,
no; I am very certain France will
never permit it.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” replied the ambassador,
shaking his head with a doubtful
air, either because he was not convinced,
but more probably because
he was well pleased to arouse
against the conqueror of Venice the
animosity of England (still, as he
considered, entirely governed by
the will of the minister who stood
before him).</p>

<p>“I assure you of it most positively,”
answered Wolsey; “and I wish
you to bear it in mind.” And he regarded
him with an expression of
perfect confidence and authority.</p>

<p>“I hope it may be so,” said the
ambassador in an abstracted manner.
“We certainly desire nothing
more.”</p>

<p>“Ah! if he had only you to oppose
him,” answered Wolsey, resuming
his usual haughtiness, “I should
doubt of success. See where you
stand,” he continued, with the secret
satisfaction of national pride.
“Invaded on all sides, Italy can
oppose but a feeble barrier to the
power of two such bold and daring
pirates. Is it not a shame, then, to
see these obscure and cruel robbers,
sons of a Lesbian potter&mdash;two barbarians,
in fact&mdash;reigning sovereigns
of the kingdom of Algiers, which
they have seized, and from whence
they fearlessly go forth to destroy
the Christian fleets on every sea?
When would you be able to conquer
these ocean pirates&mdash;you, who
have but a gibbet for your couch
and a halter for your vestment?
Justice would be kept a long time
waiting!”</p>

<p>The Italian reddened and bit his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
lip. He vainly sought words in
which to reply, and was relieved
of his embarrassment when the door
opened and admitted the Dukes of
Norfolk and Suffolk.</p>

<p>They entered without the usual
ceremonies or salutations, and
Wolsey, surprised at seeing Suffolk,
whom he had not met since the
altercation at Blackfriars, regarded
them with astonishment. He arose,
however, and advanced toward
them. Suffolk, with a disdainful
gesture, referred him to the Duke
of Norfolk.</p>

<p>Astonished at the coldness of the
one, the brusque impoliteness of
the other, and embarrassed by the
presence of the ambassador, the
cardinal stood motionless, undecided
what to think or say.</p>

<p>“My lords,” he at length exclaimed,
“what do you desire of
me?”</p>

<p>“We want you to deliver up the
seal of state,” replied Norfolk, without
changing countenance.</p>

<p>“What do you say, my lord?”
cried Wolsey, stupefied with astonishment.</p>

<p>“The king has ordered it,” continued
the duke with the same imperturbable
manner.</p>

<p>“The king! Can it be possible?”
said Wolsey, dismayed, and
in a voice almost inaudible. “The
seal of state! And what have I
done? What? Can this be true?
No, my lord, no,” he suddenly exclaimed
with an expression of indescribable
terror; “it cannot be
true! You have mistaken the
king; I do not deserve any such
treatment. I pray you let me see
him; let me speak to him for a
moment&mdash;one single moment. Alas!
alas!”</p>

<p>And he glanced at the ambassador,
who, astounded himself at first,
and feeling himself out of place in
the presence of this mighty downfall,
had involuntarily withdrawn towards
the door.</p>

<p>“It is no longer a question to be
submitted to the king,” cried Suffolk
in a threatening and defiant
manner; “it is only necessary now
to obey him, and he orders you instantly
to deliver up the seal.”</p>

<p>“The order is imperative,” added
Norfolk in a cold and serious
manner. “I regret being charged
with a commission which to you,
my lord, must be so painful.”</p>

<p>He said no more. But Suffolk,
base and jealous in his nature, was
not ashamed to add to the humiliation
of the unfortunate cardinal.</p>

<p>“Come, my good friend,” he said
in an ironical voice, “why do you
beg so imploringly? One would suppose
we had demanded the apple
of your eye. You have been putting
the seal so long now on our
purses and tongues, you ought not
to be surprised nor annoyed that
we feel like using it awhile ourselves.”</p>

<p>This cowardly insult exasperated
Wolsey, but his courage was roused
with his indignation.</p>

<p>“My Lord Suffolk,” he answered
with dignity, “I am sorry for
you and for the prompt manner in
which you seem to forget in their
misfortune those who in days of
prosperity were always found ready
to come to your assistance. I hope
you may never experience how
painful it is to endure a similar
cruel ingratitude.”</p>

<p>He immediately withdrew, and
returned with the richly-adorned
casket containing the great seal of
state.</p>

<p>Holding it in his trembling hand,
he avoided Suffolk, and, advancing
rapidly toward the Duke of Norfolk,
handed it to him.</p>

<p>“My lord,” he said, “here are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
the seals of the kingdom of England.
Let the king’s will be done.
Since I received them from his
hand, fifteen years ago, I am conscious
of having done nothing to
merit his displeasure. I trust he
will one day deign to render me
full justice, for I have never proved
myself unworthy of his favor.”</p>

<p>As he uttered the last words, he
was unable to restrain the tears
which involuntarily arose to his
eyes.</p>

<p>Although the cardinal was by no
means a favorite with the Duke of
Norfolk, he was moved with compassion,
and sadly reflected that he
had still more painful intelligence
to communicate.</p>

<p>He glanced at his companion,
but, fearing the bitter and poignant
irony in which Suffolk never failed
to indulge, he hastened to prevent
it in order to spare Wolsey.</p>

<p>“My lord cardinal,” he said,
“you ought to reflect that the king
is too just and impartial to withdraw
the favor he has so long bestowed
on you without having
weighed well the reasons and necessities
requiring such a course.
Nevertheless, his goodness has not
abandoned you; he permits you to
select such counsel as you may desire
to defend you against the accusations
presented against you to
Parliament.”</p>

<p>“To Parliament!” murmured
Wolsey, terror-stricken; for the
duke’s last words suddenly disclosed
the depth of the abyss into which
he had fallen. “To Parliament!”
he repeated. The shock he had
experienced was so violent that his
pride of character, the sense of personal
dignity, the presence of his
enemies, were all forgotten in a
moment, and he abandoned himself
to despair. Unable longer to sustain
himself, he sank on his knees.
“I am lost!” he cried, weeping and
extending his hands toward his persecutors.
“Have pity on me, my
Lord Norfolk! I give up all to the
king! Let him do with me what he
will! Since he says I am culpable,
although I have never had the intention,
yet I will acknowledge that I
am. But, alas! of what do they
accuse me?”</p>

<p>“Of having violated the statutes
of præmunire,” replied Norfolk.</p>

<p>“And betraying your country,”
continued Suffolk, “by carrying on
a secret correspondence with the
King of France. You well remember
that it was you who had me
recalled at the moment when, having
become master of Artois and
Picardy, I had the Parisians trembling
within their walls? Will you
dare deny that you were the cause
of it, and that it was the <i lang="fr">prière d’argent</i>
of Mme. Louise<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> induced you
to give the order for me to retire?
The king has been already long
enough your dupe, and our duty
was to enlighten him. As to the
rest, my lord cardinal, you understand
the proceedings; your advocate
ought to be here, and you
should immediately confer with him
with regard to the other charges
herein contained.”</p>

<p>As he said this, he threw on the
cardinal’s table the bill of presentment,
which contained no less than
forty-four chief accusations.</p>

<p>They then took possession of all
the papers they could find, carrying
away the seal of state, and left
Wolsey in a condition deserving
pity.</p>

<p>As they retired, they proposed
sending in the advocate, who was
waiting in an adjoining apartment
conversing with Cromwell.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! you are here, then, Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
Cromwell,” said the Duke of Suffolk,
laughing. “Go in, go in there at
once,” he cried, pointing to the
door of Wolsey’s cabinet. “The
cardinal needs you; I fear he will
be hard to console.”</p>

<p>Cromwell watched with great
anxiety the course of events, and,
not knowing to which side to turn,
determined at least to secure for
himself the appearance and merit
of fidelity to his benefactor. Without
reflecting on the consequences,
he hastily replied that he would
not leave Wolsey, would never abandon
him, but follow him to the end.</p>

<p>“You will follow him to the end,
eh?” replied Suffolk. “When you
know his intended destination, I
doubt very much if you will then
ask to follow him.”</p>

<p>As he said this, he made a gesture
giving Cromwell to understand
that his master, besides losing
place and power, was also in danger
of losing his head.</p>

<p>“High treason, my dear sir, high
treason!” cried Suffolk. “Do you
hear me?”</p>

<p>“High treason?” repeated Cromwell
slowly. “Ah! my lord duke,
how could he be guilty?”</p>

<p>He hastened to rejoin Wolsey,
whom he found bathed in tears
and endeavoring to decipher the
act of presentment.</p>

<p>“Ah! Cromwell,” exclaimed the
unhappy cardinal on seeing him,
“my dear friend, you have not then
forsaken me! But, alas! I am lost.
Read here for yourself&mdash;read it
aloud to me; for my sight is failing.”</p>

<p>Cromwell seized the paper and
commenced reading the accusation.
On hearing that it was based principally
on the violation of the statutes
of præmunire,<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Wolsey was unable
to control his indignation.</p>

<p>“How,” he cried, “can the king
be induced to sanction such unparalleled
injustice? It is true that in
receiving from the pope the title of
legate, and exercising throughout
the kingdom the authority conferred
by that title, I have been
brought in opposition to the precautionary
statutes of King Richard;
but still I have not violated
them, since the king himself has
sanctioned that power and recognized
it by appearing in his own
person before the court. Is he not
more to blame, then, who desired and
ordered it, than I, who have simply
been made a party to it? I can
prove this,” he cried&mdash;“yes, I can
prove it; for I have still the letters-patent,
signed by his own hand, and
which he furnished me to that effect.
Cromwell, look in my secretary;
you will find them there.”</p>

<p>Cromwell opened the secretary,
but found nothing.</p>

<p>“There is not a single paper
here,” he said. “Where could
you have placed them?”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” exclaimed the cardinal.
“Then they have all been
carried away! All!” he repeated.
“I have no longer any means of
defence; I am lost! They are all
arrayed against me; they have resolved
upon my death. O Henry!
O my king! is it thus you
forget in one moment the services
I have rendered you? Cromwell,”
he continued in a low voice and
gloomy, abstracted manner&mdash;“Cromwell,
I am lost!”</p>

<p>The same evening another messenger
came to inform the unhappy
cardinal the king wished to occupy,
during the session of Parliament
he was about to convene, his palace
of York (the object of his care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
and pride), and that in leaving it he
could retire to, and have at his disposal,
a house about eight leagues
from London, entirely abandoned,
and belonging to the bishopric of
Winchester.</p>

<p class="break">The night, already far advanced,
found Sir Thomas More still seated
in his cabinet, conversing with the
Bishop of Rochester, who had arrived
at Chelsea very late that
morning.</p>

<p>A light was burning on a long
table encumbered with books and
papers; several high-backed chairs,
covered with black morocco, cast
their shadows on the walls; a capacious
rug of white sheep-skin
was spread before the hearth, where
the remains of a fire still burned
in the grate.</p>

<p>Such was the simplicity of the
home of Sir Thomas More.</p>

<p>“And why, my dear friend,” asked
the Bishop of Rochester, “will
you consent to take upon your
shoulders so terrible a responsibility?
Once become chancellor,
have you fully considered that you
will be surrounded by enemies, who
will watch your every movement
and pursue you even to your death?
Have you reflected well that you
acknowledge no other laws than
those of your own conscience, and
feel no remorse unless for not having
spoken your views with sufficient
candor? Is it thus you hope
to resist&mdash;thus you hope to escape
the snares that will continually surround
you?”</p>

<p>“I fear nothing,” replied More;
“for I believe in God! And you
yourself&mdash;would you not blame such
weakness? In refusing the king I
refuse the queen. Would not Catherine
then declare that the trusted
servant, even he who had been
called her friend, had sacrificed
her interests to his love of ease?
He had declared his life should be
devoted to her cause, and now had
abandoned and deprived her of
the only hope of relief Providence
seemed to have left her! No,
Fisher, friendship has rights too
sacred for me not to respect them.”</p>

<p>“Then,” cried the bishop, “if
you respect the rights of friendship,
listen to my appeal! I ask
you to decline a dignity that will
prove destructive to you. In the
name of all that you hold most
dear, in the name of all that is
good and beautiful in nature, in
the entire universe, I conjure you
to refuse this fatal honor! It is
more than probable the very seal
they wish now to place in your
hands will be very soon affixed to
your death-warrant! Believe me,
my friend, all will unite against
you. A deep conviction has taken
possession of my soul, and I see, I
feel, the wrath of this prince, as violent
as he is cruel, ready to fall upon
your devoted head. You will
be crushed in this struggle, too unequal
to admit for an instant the
hope of escape.”</p>

<p>“Ah! well,” replied More laughingly,
“instead, then, of simply inscribing
on my tombstone ‘Here
lies Thomas More,’ there will appear
in pompous style the inscription,
‘Here lies the Lord High
Chancellor of England.’ Assuredly,
I think that would sound much
better, and I shall take care to bequeath
my first quarter’s salary to
defray the expense of so elegant
an inscription.”</p>

<p>“More!” cried the Bishop of
Rochester with impatience, “I cannot
suffer you to jest on a subject
of such grave importance. Do
you, then, desire to die? Would
you ruin yourself? Trust to my
experience. I know the heart of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
Henry thoroughly; your attempt
to save the queen will be vain, and
you will inevitably be involved in
her ruin. I conjure you, then, accept
not this office. I will myself
carry your refusal to the king.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” exclaimed More. “I
have decided&mdash;decided irrevocably.”</p>

<p>“Irrevocably?” repeated Rochester,
whom the thought reduced almost
to despair. “More, I see it.
You have become ambitious; the
vainglory of the world, the fatal
infatuation of its honors, have taken
possession even of the soul of
Thomas More! Your heart no
longer responds to mine; your ear
remains deaf to all my solicitations!
Ah! well, since the desire
of being honored among men, and
to have them grovel at your feet,
has made even you despise my
counsel and advice, then listen, listen
well, and God grant that I may
be able to destroy in your heart
the poison that pride has poured
into it! You are willing to sacrifice
to your vanity all the happiness,
all the quiet and peace, of
your future; know, then, what recompense
will be meted out to you.
Yesterday Wolsey was in a manner
driven from his palace, and descended
the Thames in a common boat,
Cromwell alone accompanying him;
for all have deserted him except
his enemies, who, in order to enjoy
his calamities, crowded the river
in boats and followed after him.
They hoped to see him arrested
and carried to the Tower, the report
having been circulated that he
would be taken there. Wolsey&mdash;he
whom you have so often seen make
his appearance in Parliament, surrounded
by an almost royal pomp
and splendor&mdash;is now a fugitive,
alone, abandoned, without defence,
of the clamorous insults and bitter
scorn of a populace always eager
to feast their eyes on the ruins of
fallen greatness. The air around
him resounded with their maledictions.
‘Here is the man who fattened
on the blood of the poor,’
they cried. ‘The taxes will be reduced
now,’ exclaimed others,
‘since he will have no farther use
for palaces and gardens’; and all,
in their ignorance, abused him as
the cause of the wrongs and oppressions
which it was probably
not in his power to have averted.
At length, overwhelmed with insults
and outrages, he was landed
at Pultney, and, in order to escape
the mob, was hurriedly conducted
to his house at Asher, where he has
been banished. Such is the reward
you will receive in the service of
an avaricious prince and a blind
infatuated multitude!”</p>

<p>He paused, overcome by anxiety
and excitement.</p>

<p>“My dear Fisher,” responded
More, deeply moved, “our hearts
and thoughts are always in unison;
you have only represented to me a
second time the picture I had already
painted myself.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” cried Rochester; “and
do you still hesitate?”</p>

<p>“What!” replied More, resolutely,
“and does it require so much
hesitation to sacrifice one’s self?
I would not wish to live dishonored;
and I should consider myself
guilty if I forgot my duty toward
my sovereign and the honor of
England!”</p>

<p>“So you are resolved! Ah! well,
let your sacrifice be accomplished,”
said the saintly bishop; “but then
may God, whose goodness is infinite,
hear my vows and grant my
prayer: may the same dangers unite
us; side by side with you may my
last sigh be breathed out with yours;
and if the life of the aged man is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
not extinguished before that of the
man in his prime, then may the
stroke of death cut us down at the
same moment!”</p>

<p>“My dear friend,” cried More,
“the many years that have passed
over your head and blanched your
locks have not yet ripened your
judgment, since you can believe it
possible that the king’s anger, although
it may one day fall on me,
could ever be permitted to overtake
you, the counsellor of his
youth, whom he has so often called
his father! No, I can conceive of
no such fearful possibility; the wise,
the virtuous Bishop of Rochester
can never be involved in the misfortune
that would crush Thomas
More.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” replied Fisher, “but I
shall understand how to call down
on my head the vengeance with
which he may hesitate to strike me.
Believe me, More, a man scarcely
reaches the prime of life before he
feels himself, as it were, daily beginning
to fail. Just as in the autumn
days the sun’s light rapidly
diminishes, so the passing years
despoil his body of physical strength
and beauty; but it has no effect
upon his soul. The heart&mdash;no, the
heart never grows old! It loves,
it suffers, as in the early morning of
life; and when at last it has reached
the age when wisdom and experience
have destroyed the illusions
of the passions, friendship, strengthened
by so many blessed memories,
reigns there alone and entire, like a
magnificent flower that has been
sheltered and preserved from the
destroying worm.</p>

<p>“Having almost arrived at the
end of his career, he often takes a
survey of the road he has passed
over. He loves to recall his joys
and his sorrows, and to weep again
for the friends he has lost. I know
that presumptuous youth imagines
that the prudence he refuses to
obey is the only good that remains
after the labors of life have been
terminated by time.</p>

<p>“Your feelings are not in unison
with those of an old man. It is because
you do not understand them.
He lives in memory, and you in
hope. You pursue a phantom, a
chimera, the nothingness of which
he has already experienced; you
accuse him, he complains of you,
and often you do not deign to regard
the last bitter tear that is
drawn from him at the sight of the
tomb into which he must soon descend.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed More, “you
whom I venerate as a father and
love as a friend&mdash;can you doubt for
one moment the truth of a heart
entirely devoted to you? Confirmed
by your example, guided and
sustained by your counsels, what
have I to fear? Banish from your
mind these sad presentiments. Why
should this dread of the future, that
perhaps after all is only chimerical,
destroy the extreme happiness I
enjoy in seeing you?”</p>

<p>For a long time they continued
to converse, until the light of early
morning at length succeeded the
uncertain glimmer of the candle,
now flickering in its socket.</p>

<p>“My friend, I must leave you,”
said Rochester. “The day already
dawns. God grant the sun may
not this morning arise on the beginning
of your misfortunes!”</p>

<p>“Oh! no,” replied More, “this
is my <i lang="fr">fête</i> to-day. S. Thomas will
pray for and protect us.”</p>

<p>The good bishop then descended
to the courtyard and mounted his
mule; but More, unwilling to give
him up, walked on by his side as
far as the road followed the course
of the river. When they reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
the cross-road where the bishop
turned off, More shook his hand
and bade him farewell.</p>

<p>A great wooden cross stood near
the roadside, on which was suspended
a wreath of withered
leaves; and More, seating himself
on one of the stone steps upon
which the cross was elevated, followed
the good bishop with his
eyes until he had disappeared in
the distance.</p>

<p>He then rested his head sadly on
his hands, and recalled to mind all
this venerable friend had said to
him.</p>

<p>“He is right!” he mentally exclaimed.
“How clear-sighted his
friendship renders him! Into what
a sea of agitation, malignity, and
hatred I shall be plunged! And
all for what? In order that I may
be lord chancellor of the kingdom
through which this road passes.
Behold, then, beside the highway,”
he added, looking around him, “my
lord the great high chancellor,
shivering in the cold morning air
just as any other man would do
who had gone out at this hour without
putting on his cloak!… Yes,
I can understand how social distinctions
might cause us to scorn
other men, if they exempted us
from the inconveniences of life.
We might then perhaps believe that
we had different natures. But let
us change our garments, and we
fall at once, and are immediately
confounded with the common
herd.”</p>

<p>While making these sad reflections
upon the follies of human nature,
More arose and returned to
the house, where his wife and children
and his aged father&mdash;simple
and peaceable old man, happy in
the favor of the king and the virtues
of his son&mdash;were all wrapped
in profound slumber.</p>

<p>In a spacious apartment, of which
the dark and worm-eaten ceiling,
ragged tapestry, and dilapidated
windows presented the appearance
of a desolate and abandoned edifice,
a fragment of broken furniture still
remained, upon which was placed
a small piece of bread. Numberless
crumbs strewed the dusty floor
and were eagerly devoured by a little
mouse, but recently the only
inhabitant of the place. To-day,
however, he had the company of a
man whose extraordinary mind had
conceived vast projects and executed
great and useful enterprises&mdash;the
Archbishop of York, Cardinal
Wolsey. Seated upon the edge of
a wooden stool which he had placed
in the embrasure of a window, he
held his hands crossed one upon
the other, and bitterly reflected upon
his unhappy destiny. Regrets,
of which he felt all the impotency,
pressed upon his agitated soul. It
seemed to him that he still heard
the cries and menaces of the furious
populace that exulted in his distress,
and to which perhaps, alas! he
would again be subjected. At one
time filled with courage and resolution,
at another humble and cast
down, the anxieties of his mind
seemed wholly without measure.
His eyes, wearied with straying
listlessly over the plain which extended
before him, beheld only a
single laborer ploughing the field.
“Man is small,” said he, “in presence
of immensity; the point which
he forms in space is imperceptible.
Entire generations have passed
away, have gathered the fruits of
the earth, and now sleep in their
native dust. My name has been unknown
to them. Millions of creatures
suffer, where I exist free from pain.
Coming up from the lowest ranks
of society, I have endeavored to
elevate myself above them. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
what has my existence signified to
them? Has not each one considered
himself the common centre
around which all the others must
revolve?”</p>

<p>Here Wolsey, impelled by extreme
hunger, approached the little worm-eaten
table, and took up the morsel
of dry bread left from his repast
the evening before.</p>

<p>Just as he was raising it to his
mouth a man entered, dressed in
the most scrupulous manner, and
enveloped in an ample cloak of the
finest material.</p>

<p>Wolsey was startled, and gazed
at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>“What! Arundel,” he exclaimed
at last, “what could have brought
you to this place?”</p>

<p>“Yourself,” replied Arundel, in
a frank, abrupt manner. “You
have lost everything, and have never
informed me by a word! Do you
think, then, I have forgotten all you
have done for me?”</p>

<p>“The favors I have conferred on
you were so slight,” replied Wolsey,
“that it would have been natural
you should have no longer remembered
them, especially since many
who owe their wealth, and perhaps
their lives, to me have so completely
forgotten it.”</p>

<p>“I have never learned how to
flatter nor to wear velvet gloves,”
replied Arundel; “but I am still
more ignorant of the art of forgetting
past favors. No, it has never
been my custom to act thus; and
you have offended me more than
you imagine by proving you believed
me capable of such baseness.”</p>

<p>As he said this, Arundel took
from his bosom an immense purse
of red satin, filled with gold, and
laid it on the dilapidated table beside
a package of clothing which he
had thoughtfully added to his gift.</p>

<p>“There are no acknowledgments
to be made,” he remarked; “it is
essential first of all that you be
made comfortable. You can return
this when it suits your convenience.
Now let us say no more about it.”</p>

<p>“Alas!” cried Wolsey, “are you
not aware, then, that I may never
be able to return it? They will
divide my ecclesiastical benefices
among them. The Duke of Norfolk
and the Earl of Wiltshire have
already been put in possession of
the revenue from my bishopric of
Winchester. This is the only food
I have had since I came here,” he
added, showing him the bread he
still held in his hand.</p>

<p>“Indeed! It is not very delicate,”
replied Arundel; “but it is your
own fault. When one has friends,
he should not neglect them, and
that is just what you have done.”</p>

<p>“Misfortune often renders us
unjust,” answered the cardinal,
deeply moved by the generous
frankness and brusque proceedings
of Arundel, whom he had always,
until now, regarded as being haughty
and ungrateful, because he had
never observed him among his
crowd of fawning courtiers. “I
must confess that I could not endure
the thought of being repulsed
by those for whom I have done
everything. I do not believe that
among the immense number of those
who daily wearied me with protestations
of their ostentatious regard
there is to-day one who has condescended
to think of me in my misfortunes.
You only have thought
to succor me in my distress&mdash;you,
who, without my being aware of it,
have doubtless been all the while
the most sincere among them all.”</p>

<p>“I cannot believe,” replied Arundel,
without appearing to notice
the acknowledgments with which
Wolsey continued to overwhelm
him, “that they would all thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
have abandoned you had they
known the extreme severity with
which you have been treated; it
would be too foul a blot upon the
name of humanity. Notwithstanding
they laugh at our misfortunes, I
think it appears worse to us than it
really is. No, be assured you will
find some faithful friends who will
defend you. For instance, Sir Thomas
More, your successor, whose
fortune you have made, cannot fail
to use his influence in your favor.”</p>

<p>“More owes me nothing,” replied
the cardinal. “I have not made
his fortune; when I proposed him
to the king as Treasurer of the Exchequer,
he had for a long time
been acquainted with his rare
merits. Knowing that the appointment
would prove both useful and
agreeable to the king, I recommended
him to make it; but really it was
more for the king’s benefit than
More’s. Besides, I am aware that
More is one of the most zealous
partisans of Catherine. Thus, you
see, there exists no reason why he
should feel inclined to assist me. I
am only surprised that a man of
his exalted integrity should accept
a position where he will necessarily
be compelled to act in opposition
to his convictions.”</p>

<p>“It is with the eager desire of
ultimately being able to convert all
the world and to correct all consciences,”
replied Arundel with a
smile of derision; for he never lost
an occasion of ridiculing the importance
which many attach to political
intrigues, and, as they say, to
the public good, in whose management
they pretend to take a hand,
in order to win admiration at any
cost for their talents. “And verily,
he will find it difficult to sustain
his position, unless he becomes the
very humble servant of my Lady
Anne, regent of the kingdom; for
nothing is done but what she ordains,
and her uncle, whom she has
appointed chief of the council, executes
the orders which the king
claims the honor of communicating
to him. Oh!” continued Arundel
in the same ironical tone, and
without perceiving the painful effect
his words produced on the unhappy
cardinal, “truly it is a very great
advantage, and above all highly
honorable for England, to see her
king put in tutelage to the caprices
of a woman as weak and vain as
she is arrogant. If he was absolutely
determined to go into leading-strings,
why did he not beseech
the good Queen Catherine to take
charge of him? She, at least, would
have been careful to hold the reins
equally on both sides, so that the
swaddling could have been made to
walk straight.”</p>

<p>“A swaddling,” repeated Wolsey, “… who
devoured his nurse!”</p>

<p>“Hold, my dear lord,” continued
Arundel; “it cannot be denied that
you have made a great mistake in
encouraging the king in his divorce
project&mdash;yes, a great mistake, which
they now begin to discover. But I
do wrong, perhaps, to reproach you,
since you are the first to be punished
for your manner of seeing things.
But listen to me; as for myself, if,
in order to avoid dying of starvation,
or being compelled to subsist
on just such bread as you have
there, I had been obliged to accept
the place of lord chancellor, on
the day when I found myself relieved
of so burdensome and exacting
an office I should have cried aloud:
‘Thank heaven that I am again
seated by my own fireside, where in
peace and quiet I can get up at
my leisure and contemplate passing
events.’ For myself, these are my
principles: to have nothing to do
is the first essential to happiness;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
nothing to lose, the second; nothing
to disturb or annoy, the third; and
upon these rest all the others.
Such is my system&mdash;the best of all
systems, the only.…”</p>

<p>Arundel would have still continued
explaining the numerous theories
he had originated for securing
happiness for an indefinite length
of time, perhaps, but he suddenly
perceived that Wolsey no longer
heard him, but, with his head sunk
on his breast, seemed absorbed in
thought.</p>

<p>“Well, my lord,” said Arundel,
“you are not listening to me, it
seems? Really, it is not worth
while to explain to you the true
method of being happy.”</p>

<p>“Ah! my dear Arundel,” replied
Wolsey, aroused by the exclamation
of his visitor, “how could
you expect me to think of profiting
by your lessons, or to make an application
of your theories of happiness,
when at this very moment,
perhaps, I have been condemned to
death by Parliament?”</p>

<p>“There is no proof of that,”
replied Arundel. “Sufficient unto
the day is the evil&mdash;gloomy apprehensions
profit us nothing; they
do not delay the progress of
events; on the contrary, they send
them on us in advance, and only
serve to aggravate the consequences.
Moreover, I must not forget
to suggest that if it would be more
agreeable for you to be with your
friends, there are many who will
be happy to receive you, and offer
you a mansion as commodious, although
less sumptuously furnished,
than your palace of York or that
of Hampton Court, the latter of
which I have never liked since you
added the gallery.”</p>

<p>“What is that gallery to me
now? I surrender it up to you,”
said the cardinal.</p>

<p>The endless arguments of Arundel
began to weary him exceedingly.
In spite of the extreme gratitude
he felt for his sincere and generous
offers, Wolsey could not divest
himself of the conviction that
Arundel belonged to that class
who, while in other respects full
of good impulses and laudable intentions,
are so entirely wanting in
tact and delicacy, and contend so
urgently for their own opinions,
that the consolations they would
force you to adopt, far from alleviating
your sufferings, only augment
them and render their sympathy
irksome and oppressive. This feeling
was experienced by Wolsey,
uncertain as he was what fate was
reserved for him, trembling even
for his life, while Arundel endeavored
to paint for him a minute picture
of the happiness and tranquillity
enjoyed by a man living in
peace and quiet, with nothing to
disturb him in the enjoyment of
his possessions.</p>

<p>“Alas!” he exclaimed at length
impatiently, “why has not kind
Providence blessed me with a nature
like yours? I should be less
unhappy, nor every instant see
yawning before me the terrible
depths of the precipice on which
I now stand. I could catch, at
least, at the branches of absurdity,
until the moment when I should be
dashed to pieces! But no, I cannot;
I am too well acquainted with
men and things to expect the
slightest assistance. They are always
ready to strike those who are
falling, but never attempt to raise
them up. Yesterday, only yesterday,
the commissioners of Parliament
demanded of me the letters-patent
I had received from the king in order
to exercise my authority as legate,
although every one knew that,
as he had given them to me, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
his right alone to take them away
again. Ah! well, they have persisted
in their demand, and have
refused to believe me on oath!
No, I will indulge in no more illusions;
my enemies have sworn
my death, and they will obtain it!
And the king, the king my master,
after fifteen years of the most faithful
service, he delivers me up, helpless
and defenceless, to all the cruelties
their hatred may inspire; and
yet you, Arundel, think that I
should still indulge in hope?”</p>

<p>“But all this will be arranged, I
tell you,” replied Arundel with an imperturbable
coolness. “You should
not trouble yourself in advance,
because, if the worst <em>should</em> happen,
it will change nothing; and if
it does <em>not</em>, your present suffering
will have been needless.”</p>

<p>As Arundel finished this wise reasoning,
Cromwell appeared.</p>

<p>He came from London, where he
had been, he said, to defend Wolsey
before the Parliament.</p>

<p>On seeing him enter the cardinal
was seized with an uncontrollable
alarm, thinking his fate had been
decided.</p>

<p>“Cromwell!” he cried, and could
say no more.</p>

<p>“Ah!” replied Cromwell, “you
should not thus give way to your
apprehensions, although.…” He
paused on seeing the cardinal grow
deadly pale. “You need have no
uneasiness, because the king has
sent Norris to bid me assure you
he would take you under his protection.”</p>

<p>“I have been condemned, then!”
cried the unhappy Wolsey. “Speak,
Cromwell, speak; conceal nothing
from me. I am not a child,” he
added with firmness.</p>

<p>“You have been condemned by
the Star Chamber, but the king
says he will have the bill rejected
in the House of Commons,” replied
Cromwell.</p>

<p>“He will not do it!” cried Wolsey,
the tears coursing rapidly
down his cheeks. “He will sacrifice
me, Cromwell, I know it; he
has no longer any use for me, and
my past services have left no impression
on his mind. But how
far has their rage carried them?
To what have they condemned
me?”</p>

<p>“You have been placed beyond
the protection of the king, and all
your property confiscated.”</p>

<p>“The king’s protection is already
recovered,” gently interrupted Arundel,
who had listened until this time
in silence. “As for the confiscation,
that will be more difficult, inasmuch
as they are generally more ready to
take than to give. However, my
dear cardinal, you should despair
of nothing; then let us try and
console you. They cannot confiscate
me, who have never had anything
to do with the gentlemen of
the council. I have a good house,
an excellent cook; you will come
home with me, and, my word for it,
you shall want for nothing.”</p>

<p>“Arundel,” interrupted the cardinal,
“I am deeply grateful for
your kind offer; but believe me,
they will not leave me the choice
of profiting by it.”</p>

<p>“Why not? why not?” exclaimed
Arundel. “The devil! Why,
these gentlemen of the council are
not wild beasts! A little avaricious,
a little ambitious, a little envious,
and slightly selfish, but they
are at least as accommodating as
the devil!”</p>

<p>“No!” replied Wolsey.</p>

<p>“I assure you, before receiving
the king’s message,” said Cromwell,
“I was in despair, for they spoke
of having you arrested and immediately
urging the accusation of high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
treason; but since the king has declared
you under his protection, I
do not believe that all is entirely
lost. Norris has repeated to me
twenty times: ‘Say positively to
the cardinal that the king advises
him not to be troubled, and to remember
that he can give him,
any moment he pleases, far more
than they can take away.’”</p>

<p>“I hope I may be mistaken, dear
Cromwell,” replied the cardinal
with a sombre air; “but I fear a
momentary compassion only has
excited the king to say what you
tell me, and it will not be long
before that wicked night-bird<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
will again have possession of his ear.
She will not fail to use her influence
in defaming me and blackening anew
all my actions, until the king will
cease to oppose the wicked designs
they have conceived against me.”</p>

<p>Saying this, he buried his face in
his hands and sank into a state of
despondency impossible to describe.</p>

<p>Cromwell made no reply, and
Arundel silently took his leave, inwardly
congratulating himself, as he
returned home, upon the tranquil and
happy life he knew so well how to
lead, and censuring those who
would not imitate his example;
without once reflecting that few
were in a position so agreeable or
independent as his, and consequently
were not able to enjoy themselves
equally nor after his own deliberate
fashion.</p>

<h3>VILLAGE LIFE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.</h3>

<p>“I think I shall start for New
Hampshire to-morrow,” I said.
“Do you know anything about
L&mdash;&mdash;, in Cheshire County?”</p>

<p>Jones, who had been meditatively
examining the coloring of a
richly-tinted meerschaum, sat up
erect at this question, with a sudden
access of vigor.</p>

<p>“L&mdash;&mdash;?” he said. “By George!
there’s where Agnes Cortland lives
now in the summer.”</p>

<p>It was the middle week of July.
Aspirations for one whiff of the
breeze among the hills had become
irresistible. We were sitting together,
Jones and I, in my room
up-town after luncheon. Jones was
a young New York artist in his first
season after his return from Italy
the previous autumn. He, too,
was about to start on a sketching
tour through Vermont, in which
State his people lived. He was
late leaving town, but money was
not easy with him&mdash;a handsome
young fellow of that golden age
between twenty-three and twenty-four,
when one is apt to think he
needs only a very short-handled
lever to move the world. He was
of medium height, but squarely
and powerfully built; with a face
good-natured, but very resolute, in
expression. A stranger would not
be likely to take a liberty with him.
I had a strong notion that Jones
would make a better soldier than
artist, if there were any question of
blows being struck for the country,
which happily there is not. But
hitherto I had shrewdly kept that
opinion to myself. Considerably
older than he was, and engaged in
another occupation, circumstances
had thrown us a good deal together.
Intimacy had brought confidence,
and confidence, at his age, meant&mdash;nothing
more nor less than it always
does under such circumstances&mdash;the
unbosoming of his love
affairs. How few there are who
have not found themselves in the
same position, either as actors or
sympathetic chorus, or in time as
both! What countless dramas of
passion are continually being put
upon the private stage before this
limited audience!</p>

<p>Now, it is not the purpose of
this paper to pursue the history of
Jones’ captivity at the hands of
the tender goddess through all the
infinitesimal and transcendental
chapters a first romance runs into.
More placid emotions and observations,
befitting the serenity of approaching
middle age, are in store
for the reader. And in fact the history
of Jones’ passion is still incomplete.
But so much of it may
be given as fell within the purview
of our New Hampshire observations.</p>

<p>Jones was poor&mdash;prosaic fact,
which robs life of so many compensations
as we grow old. But at
twenty-three we spurn the mastery
of the glittering dross&mdash;that is, if
Congress gives us any to spurn!
Let us say rather of the flimsy paper.
At that age of our flowing
life we coin money at our own
mint; or, more truly, draw limitless
drafts on the Bank of the
Future. Happy the man who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
meets them when they fall due!
Jones, at least, had no doubts as to
his future solvency. But his plans
were vague&mdash;very!</p>

<p>Agnes Cortland was the daughter
of a railroad director&mdash;or two or
three directors rolled into one&mdash;and
had the world, or at least the
New York world, to choose from.
Poor Jones! his story might almost
be predicted from the start. Yet
this inheritor of the (latent) genius
of any half-dozen masters, ancient
or modern, you choose to name, believed,
perhaps with some reason,
that this daughter of Dives liked
him; and as for himself, he vowed
with hyperbole that he adored her.
They had frequently met&mdash;their
families then being neighbors in
the country&mdash;before he went to
Italy, where he had spent two years
studying and wandering about.
No avowal of affection had been
made between them, but he had
gone away with the consciousness
many little signs and tokens give
that he was not disliked. Since
his return a year ago some meetings
had taken place&mdash;at rarer intervals&mdash;in
society. At an evening
party some months before she had
given him, he said, a slight but unmistakable
opportunity of declaring
himself, if he had wished to do so.</p>

<p>“But I did not take it,” said
Jones, who, spite of his being in
love, was as manly a young fellow
as one could meet. “She knows I
am poor; and I don’t want to be
thought a fortune-hunter.”</p>

<p>I laughed at this quixotic declaration.</p>

<p>“My dear fellow,” I said, “you
fly at high game. But I should
not let the <i lang="la">auri sacra fames</i> interfere,
one way or the other, with my
tender emotions. If I did so at
all, Plutus would have his due
weight in the scale, believe me!”</p>

<p>“What would you do?” said
Jones. This was in one of those
“tobacco parliaments” in early
spring&mdash;if so they might be called,
where one, only, smoked, and the
other looked on with sympathy; for
I had abandoned the “weed” some
years before&mdash;hardly of such profundity,
nor yet so silent, as those
Mr. Carlyle speaks of. Jones had
recurred to his usual topic of hopes
and perplexities.</p>

<p>“Do?” I answered, looking at
him retrospectively, as it were, as
if contemplating my own departed
youth, as he sat there in his favorite
attitude after dinner, gracefully
balancing one leg over the arm of
my chintz-covered easy-chair, while
I was stretched out on the sofa.
“Ah! that is an easy question to
propound, but not so easy to answer.
At your age I should not
think you would need much prompting.
But if you ask me, I would
say, leave it alone! Love is a
luxury for the rich or the evenly-mated
poor. But you are not likely
to take that advice. A good
deal would depend on the reinforcements
she might bring to the
struggle. A woman is not always
a passive instrument in those affairs,
but sometimes has a will of
her own. I have never seen your
fair one, and know nothing about
her. But if she be a girl of some
strength of character, and her love
do not prove a mere school-girl’s
fancy, she might possibly gain her
father’s consent. But it is not a
promising adventure, at the best;
and I would not recommend you
to embark your hopes in it. Keep
clear of serious entanglements until
you see your way before you.
Above all, avoid anything like a
clandestine engagement. It will
not add to your happiness or hers.
I don’t suppose you will think this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
a very encouraging opinion. But
there may be circumstances in your
favor I know nothing of. Marry
her, if you can, and can get the
father’s consent; and go into “railroading”
with him in his office.
You will make more money at that
than you are ever likely to do sticking
little dabs of color on a piece
of canvas.”</p>

<p>I saw Jones wince at this mercenary
view of his art. But he
bore it like a man, and continued
silent. The suggestion of such a
change of vocation did not appear
to surprise him, though it was plain
no active intention of throwing up
his art had yet entered his mind.
The fact is, Jones is one of those
young men&mdash;not inconsiderable in
numbers in the profession&mdash;who
“have a studio,” but are not likely
ever to send many master-pieces out
of it. Developing some precocious
talent for drawing when they are
boys, and seizing with boyish eagerness
upon the suggestion of being
“an artist,” they are offered by
fond but undiscerning parents
upon the altar of art. But they
never advance beyond a mechanical
dexterity in putting conventional
scenes upon canvas. They
haven’t a spark of that genius that
is often observed where other pursuits
have prevented a devotion to
the profession. Eventually they
abandon altogether the study or
practice of their art, or sink into
drudges for the picture or chromo
dealers, or grind out a living as
drawing-masters, or&mdash;Heaven knows
how. I will not say that Jones was
altogether deficient in talent, but
the talent that makes an agreeable
accomplishment for the rich amateur
is a different thing from that
which will pay the piper or win eminence
in the art. Jones painted
his pictures for the autumn and
spring exhibitions, and had one or
two on view in one of the up-town
windows. But at Du Vernet’s big
sale I know that a clever little bit
of coloring on which he had spent
some time was knocked down to a
chromo-dealer for sixteen dollars!
How was he going to live on such
prices? And as for marrying Agnes
Cortland&mdash;it was simply preposterous
to think of it. Nor is this redundancy
of young native artists
on whom neither genius nor fashion
smiles confined to New York alone.
In Boston, which is the only other
city boasting of a native school of
art, the same low prices prevail. It
is disheartening; but a more disheartening
thing still is that those
prices often represented the actual
value of the picture.</p>

<p>Jones was imperfectly educated,
though his continental travel had
made him a fair linguist. He certainly
drew very little inspiration
from the antique, for he knew next
to nothing about it; nor had he
much of that sympathy with the
undercurrent of life, and its relations
with nature, which gives significance
to common things. He
had a fondness for pleasure which,
of course, did not contribute to his
success. Yet he was one of those
young fellows whom it is impossible
to meet without liking. He
was frank, honorable, and spirited,
and had a robust shrewdness about
him in dealing with men and things
that made him a pleasant companion.
That he would eventually
choose a more active kind of life&mdash;and
probably succeed in it&mdash;I
was half-convinced, and my advice
about “railroading,” though spoken
partly in jest, was inwardly meant
in good faith.</p>

<p>On this particular July evening
on which our paper opens Jones
followed up the announcement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
my proposed trip to L&mdash;&mdash; by expressing
a wish that he were going
there too, so that he might come to
a definite understanding with Agnes
Cortland; and the wish was
soon followed by the determination
to act on it.</p>

<p>“How long do you intend to
stay there?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Till the first week in September,”
I said.</p>

<p>“Then I will come back that
way, and join you for a few days
about the first of September. The
Cortlands don’t leave there till October.
We can come back to New
York together.”</p>

<p>It would have been ungracious
on my part to have objected to
this proposal, though I had a good
many doubts about its wisdom. So
it happened that my little excursion
to L&mdash;&mdash;, which I had innocently
designed to be a season of simple
lotus-eating such as Mr. Tennyson
ascribes to his Olympian deities,
“reclined upon the hills together,
careless of mankind,” was complicated
by a subordinate interest in a
comedy from real life which had
that quiet village for a stage.</p>

<p>The next day I started, taking
Boston <i lang="fr">en route</i>. That staid, quiet,
cleanly city seems always to be,
compared with New York, like a
good school-boy by the side of a
big, blustering brother fonder of a
street row than his books. Then
to Fitchburg, where I stopped over
night, as some stage travelling was
to be done from our “jumping-off”
place, and riding over the country
roads in the morning was more
promising than on a dark and
cloudy night. In the morning the
Fitchburg Railroad again, and one
of its branches to L&mdash;&mdash;. The unwonted
coolness of the morning
breeze, as the train entered the
New Hampshire hills, already began
to refresh mind and body alike.
The pines and hemlocks extending
back into deep, dim recesses carpeted
with moss and ferns; the cattle
moving slowly over the pastures in
the distance; the pastures themselves
stretching up the sides of
the highest hills, still of the freshest
green, without a hint of the yellow
undertone that I watched gradually
overspread them as the summer ripened
into autumn; a lake in the foreground,
silent, unvisited, its clear waters
unpolluted by the dregs of commerce
or the drainage of a vast metropolis;
even the caw! caw! of the
ravens flying off from the tops of
the pine stumps, send a novel and
delicious feeling of freedom through
the breast of the city traveller who
has put care and work behind him
for a season. Nor is this feeling
altogether evanescent. Even
now, as winter approaches and the
north winds from the same hills
come sweeping down over the great
city, sending us chattering and
freezing to our cosey firesides, the
glory of the July foliage moves our
memory like a far-off dream of
youth. Yet, after all, it may be
doubted whether the charm of
country scenes is not due in great
part to their novelty and the feeling
that we are not bound to them longer
than we please. Of all that has
been written in praise of country
life, how much is the work of the
city resident; how little, comparatively
speaking, springs from the
country itself! There drudgery
too often takes the place of sentiment.
It is the Epicurean poet,
Horace, satiated with the noise of
the Forum and the gossip of the
baths, who sings sweetest of rural
contentment, of the “lowing herds,”
the “mellow fruits of autumn,” and
the “brooks murmuring over stony
beds.” But when he gives play to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
his satiric vein, none pictures more
truthfully than the Venusian the
grumbling of the husbandman, who
“turns the heavy clay with the
hard plough.” Embowered in
some shady arbor on the windings
of the Digentia through his Sabine
farm, or doing a little amateur
farming, to the amusement, as he
confesses, of his blunt country neighbors,
who laughed at the dandy
poet with a hoe in his hand, it was
easy for Horace to chant the
smooth and sunny side of country
life. But the eight laborers on his
estate, chained literally to the soil,
as many a New England farmer
morally is by the burden of debt
or family, no doubt saw things differently.
And the bailiff of his
woodlands we know to have despised
those “desert and inhospitable
wilds,” and to have longed for
the streets and shows of Rome. It
is amazing upon what inattentive
ears the music of our wild birds falls
in a secluded farm-house. Often it
seems absolutely unheard; while
the clatter of the long street of the
country town that the farmer visits
once a month is for ever in his
mind.</p>

<p>But we delay too long at the way
station at L&mdash;&mdash;. Let us onwards.</p>

<p>The carrier of the United States
mail, who is at the same time the
Jehu of the passenger stage, slings
our <i lang="la">impedimenta</i> up behind with an
energy to be envied by a veteran
“baggage-smasher” at some of our
big depots, straps it down, and
jumps upon the box. We mount
more slowly beside him, disdaining
to be shut up in the close interior,
and intent upon looking at the
country we pass through this lovely
morning. The two stout grays
breast the hill leading to L&mdash;&mdash;
Centre, eight miles distant.</p>

<p>The surface of the country is
hilly and broken; as we approach
L&mdash;&mdash;, mountainous. Mounting
the crest of the first steep hill, a
beautiful natural panorama spreads
out before us: long, narrow, intersecting
lines of timber, like giant
hedges, dividing the hill farms from
each other. A rolling country
spreads toward the east, bounded
on the horizon by a low range of
mountains wooded to the summit,
and with a white steeple flashing
out here and there among the trees
at their base. The effects of light
and shade, caused by the clouds on
a brilliant day, on one of those
white steeples, standing out solitarily
against the side of a mountain
eight or ten miles distant, are peculiar.
Sometimes it becomes invisible,
as the circle of the shadow is
projected upon that area of the
mountain which includes it. Then,
as the dark veil moves slowly, with
a sliding motion, up the side and
over the crest of the mountain, the
white spire flashes out from the obscure
background of the forest with
a sudden brilliancy. On this side
patches of blue water among the
trees in the hollows revealed the
presence of numerous ponds, as the
small lakes, and some of the large
ones, are universally called in New
England.</p>

<p>To the northwest what seemed
to be a level plain from the height
over which we rode, but which was
in reality broken and undulating
ground, stretched beneath us for
ten or twelve miles to the base of
Mt. Monadnock. The mountain,
grand, massive, and still veiled by
a thin mist, rose boldly from the
low country at its foot to a height
of nearly four thousand feet.</p>

<p>A ride of an hour and a half
brought us to the top of the hill
on the side of which stands L&mdash;&mdash;.
A dozen scattered houses flank the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
broad village green, and a Congregational
meeting-house, with white
belfry tower and green blinds,
stands half-way down the incline.</p>

<p>The post-office and country store
combined is at the cross-roads as
you drive down the hill, and some
ancient elms on the green seem to
nod at the stranger with a friendly
air as he enters the village.
“Here,” said I to myself, “is rural
quiet and simplicity. Farewell for
many slumberous weeks the busy
haunts of men.” L&mdash;&mdash; is quite
out of the beaten track of summer
travel, and had been recommended
me by a friend who had spent some
seasons there, on the ground of
economy, charming scenery, good
fishing, and repose. Nor did I find
any reason to regret having listened
to him. A country tavern offers
entertainment to man and beast,
and is resorted to by the drummers
and sample men who invade L&mdash;&mdash;,
as elsewhere, with their goods. But
I was not forced to be dependent
on it, as a letter from my friend
opened to me the hospitable doors
of the comfortable farm-house
where he had boarded two years
before.</p>

<p>Here let it be said at the outset
that whatever the other drawbacks
of village life in New Hampshire,
there is among the farming class a
natural courtesy, and, among the
women, even an inherited refinement
of manner, especially in their
treatment of strangers, which speaks
well for the native stock. Prejudices
there are among both men and
women&mdash;deep-rooted, as we shall
see&mdash;and narrow-minded opinions
in plenty; but even these are concealed
where to manifest them might
give offence. The family in which
I was domiciled consisted of Mr.
Allen and his wife, their married
daughter&mdash;who, together with her
husband, resided with them&mdash;an unmarried
daughter, and a pretty little
girl, the grandchild. Mr. Allen
kept a country store&mdash;for L&mdash;&mdash; boasted
of two&mdash;and traded also in
cattle with Canada, making a journey
sometimes as far as Montreal in
the spring to buy stock, which he
fattened on his pastures through the
summer and autumn, and sold in
the early part of the winter. These
various ventures, which were on
the whole successful&mdash;as the command
of a little ready money enabled
him to take his time and
buy and sell to advantage&mdash;had
made him more “forehanded” than
most of his neighbors. He was one
of the selectmen of L&mdash;&mdash;. His
dwelling-house, a large, white, well-kept
two-story edifice, with a garden-plot
facing the village street, a
piazza on the sunny side, and two
beautiful maples dividing the carriage
yard from the road, was one
of the handsomest in L&mdash;&mdash;. Mrs.
Allen was one of those energetic
housewives whose sound sense and
domestic capacity had evidently
contributed not a little to her husband’s
present prosperity.</p>

<p>They were a sturdy couple, intelligent,
honest, and knowing what
was due to themselves and others;
now going down the hill together
with mutual dependence and confidence
in each other. I consider
them a good example of the best
type of the New Hampshire farming
class.</p>

<p>The married daughter did not
compare favorably with the mother.
One could not say of her in any
sense:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“O matre pulchra filia pulchrior!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">for, as to the question of female
beauty, I will not say, as far as my
observations extend, that the New
Hampshire, or indeed the New England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
women generally, outside the
radius of Boston and some of the
large towns, are very generously
endowed by nature with that gracious
but dangerous gift. The
lines of the face are too strongly
marked; they are sallow, the form
angular; or, where the figure is fuller,
it is apt to be as redundant as
the old Flemish painters make the
women at a village fair.</p>

<p>But this absence of feminine
beauty is not universal. I have
seen a young mother with her babe
in her lap&mdash;a visitor sitting in Mrs.
Allen’s parlor&mdash;who made a picture
of beautiful maternity as dignified
and simple as Murillo ever painted.
As for that more lasting moral beauty
which, where it is feminine, puts on
its most delightful and engaging
charm, Mrs. Harley, the married
daughter, was too much engaged
with her own little cares and gossip&mdash;poor
woman!&mdash;to think much
of so intangible a possession.
Brought up, probably, in habits of
more leisure and pleasure-seeking
than her mother, who still took all
the household work upon herself,
she was a victim of <i lang="fr">ennui</i> and of
that blight of too many American
homes&mdash;only one child to care for.
Her health was delicate and uncertain,
and she bade fair to sink
eventually into that class of invalid
wives which forms such an unhappily
large percentage of American
women. How often have I
heard her complain of the dreadful
dulness of the day! “But,” I
asked, “what will you do in the
winter, if you find the summer so
unbearable?” Her answer was
that they generally enjoyed themselves
enough in the summer-time
to be able to get through the winter.
I don’t know whether this
was a covert thrust at my lack of
entertaining power; but I laughed
at the stroke of satire at my expense,
innocent or intended. That long
dreary, snow-shrouded New Hampshire
winter&mdash;it demanded indeed a
stout heart to face it in one of those
isolated villages. Mrs. Harley had
given up her music when she married;
the piano stood idle in the
best room. She read nothing&mdash;unless
looking at the fashion-plates in
a ladies’ magazine be considered
reading. A Sunday-school picnic,
a day’s shopping in the nearest
country town, were white days in
her calendar. Is such a picture of
life cheerless? Yet too many women
are forced to endure it elsewhere.
Happy they if the abounding
resources of the faith and its
literature come to their aid! Mrs.
Harley was a kind woman withal,
if her attention were drawn for a
moment from herself; and an affectionate
and anxious wife. This
and her love for her child&mdash;fretful
and over-indulgent as the latter
sentiment was apt to be&mdash;were
her redeeming qualities. Placed
in a large city, with means equal
in proportion to those within her
reach in L&mdash;&mdash;, she would have
made a more agreeable woman, and
would have been tenfold happier
herself. The influence of semi-solitary
life&mdash;where a religious vocation
does not exalt and sanctify
it&mdash;is more unfavorable in its effects
upon women than upon men. The
latter commonly have work to do
which keeps their faculties from
rusting. Woman’s nature is essentially
social.</p>

<p>Mr. Harley assisted his father-in-law
in the store&mdash;a tall, handsome
young man with a city air,
who, at that season, sat in the store
the whole afternoon with perhaps
one customer. Such a life for
youth, with its superabundant energies
ready to pour like a torrent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
into any channel, is stagnation.
The highest of man’s natural powers
rust and decay. But natural
forces have their sway in the great
majority of such cases, and force
an outlet for themselves. The
youth of these villages leave their
homes for the great cities, or take
Horace Greeley’s advice and “go
West.” Life is hard, and it is monotonous,
which adds a new slavery
to hardship. The exodus is constant.
L&mdash;&mdash; has less population
and fewer inhabited houses now
than it had forty years ago. The
same is true of other villages&mdash;a
striking fact in a comparatively
new country. One rambles along
some by-road overgrown with grass,
and presently comes upon a deserted
and ruined house and barn, the
rafters only standing, or perhaps
nothing more than a heap of bricks
in the cellar. He asks about the
people, and is told that they have
“gone away.” The answer is vague
and uncertain as their fate. I
spoke to an old man of eighty-seven,
seated in the shade on the
long bench before the country store,
where he could hear the news in
the morning. He remembered with
distinctness the events of the war
of 1812. He spoke with regret
of the flourishing times of his
youth in L&mdash;&mdash; and its dulness to-day.
This roving disposition of
the American youth is the result
of immense elbow-room, and has
been providential in building up
new States and subduing the virgin
wilderness. The manufacturing
cities of New Hampshire also gain
yearly at the expense of the small
villages. The township&mdash;or town,
as it is most commonly called&mdash;embraces
three or four of such villages,
and is subject to the same reciprocal
movement. Comparatively
few new farms have been broken
in during the last twenty or thirty
years; and too rarely it happens
on the old farms that fresh ground
is taken in from the pasture for
cultivation. The son tills what his
father or grandfather cleared.</p>

<p>The first few days in L&mdash;&mdash; I
spent rambling about the pastures&mdash;some
of them literally red with the
raspberry, which, though it has not
the delicacy or fragrance of the
wild strawberry, is not to be disdained
by the city palate&mdash;or
climbing to the tops of the highest
neighboring hills. What a sense
of elastic joy and freedom to me,
who had not spent a summer in
the country for three years, to lie
stretched at full length on the top
of a new-mown hill, and let the eye
wander over the valley beneath,
with its intervening woods and
ponds, till it rested upon the distant
mountains, the cloud-shadows
chasing each other over their sides
and summits! If this were not in
truth an Arcadia to those who
lived and died there, and were
buried in the white-stoned churchyard
among the elms&mdash;if to them
life brought its cares, its jealousies,
and sorrows&mdash;to the stranger who
sought nothing more than to enjoy
its natural beauties it renewed all
the associations of rural happiness
and simplicity. Not that one might
hope to see a Corydon and Phillis
issue from the New Hampshire
woods&mdash;for there is a sternness
among those northern scenes, even
in the brightest bloom of summer,
foreign to the poetry of the South&mdash;but
that in its dark pine groves and
on its windy hills fancy might picture
an eclogue or a romance not
less sweet and tender because more
real.</p>

<p>L&mdash;&mdash; is on the height of land
between the valleys of the Connecticut
and Merrimac, between twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
and thirty miles distant from each.
It is from one thousand to one
thousand three hundred feet above
the sea level. It is said of the rain
that falls on the roof of the village
church that part of it eventually
runs into the Connecticut, part into
the Merrimac, so evenly does its
roof-tree divide the water-shed of
those rivers. But as the same
story is told of other churches in
the central belt of Cheshire County,
it may be regarded rather in the
light of a rhetorical illustration
than as a fact of physical geography.
The scenery is not of the
grand or sublime order to be seen
further north among the White
Mountains, except where Mt.
Monadnock raises its dark and
solemn front above the surrounding
landscape; but it is beautiful
and picturesque. Its greatest
charm is its variety. In the morning,
when the sun was well towards
the zenith&mdash;for the fresh air of
those hills made the day at all
hours delightful&mdash;I would stroll
out over the pastures to a hill a
quarter of a mile distant from the
farm-house. There would I seat
myself, protected from the sun’s
ardent rays, under a young maple
bush, the elastic branches of which,
with the sloping ground thick with
ferns, made a natural easy-chair.
The valley is below me, the farms
stretch along the nearer hills, and
in the further distance the blue-veiled
mountains define the skyline.
I bend down a branch of
the maple, and before me is the
upper half of Mt. Monadnock, a
thin gray mist still enveloping it.
The base of the mountain is hidden
by an intervening hill. Leaving
this pasture, and walking a few hundred
rods further on, I enter a field
where the hay has just been cut, and
which is now as smooth as a croquet
lawn, but not so level; for
it is the crest of one of the highest
hills. Here a new scene awaits me.
To the north and west the hill has
the shape almost of a perfect dome.
Stretched on the top, I cannot see
the declivities of the sides, but
only the tops of the trees at some
distance. One has the sensation
of being on the roof of a high
building with a deep drop between
him and the surrounding country.
The view is superb. The whole
mass of Mt. Monadnock, from
its base to the highest elevation,
rises from the valley ten miles distant.
At its foot is the village of
West Jaffrey, a fashionable watering
place. The white spire of the
church is conspicuous among the
trees. Further south is Gap Mountain
and Attleborough Mountain;
and sweeping round to the east,
the view stretches along the New
Ipswich Mountains to Watatick
Hill. The circuit extends about
twenty or thirty miles, making a
picture of great natural beauty.
The English hay, as the timothy
and red clover are generally called,
was still standing in many of the
fields, but here and there the whirr
of the mowing-machine could be
heard, and the eye, following the
direction of the sound, could discern
the mower in his shirt-sleeves
driving his pair of horses in the
distant field. The meadow-grass
of the lowlands was still in most
places untouched. On the sides
of the hills the scattered fields of
wheat, barley, and oats, still green,
made darker patches of verdure on
the yellowish ground-color.</p>

<p>But the view I most preferred
was from a hill a little to the south
of the village near some deserted
buildings. Here the scene was
wilder and more extensive. To
the west Mt. Monadnock could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
seen through a gorge between two
hills; to the east was a wild and
broken country; while to the south
the woods seemed to extend as far
as the eye could reach, and over
the furthest range of hills the great
dome of Mt. Wachusett in Massachusetts,
nearly thirty miles distant,
was plainly seen, gray and massive,
with the naked eye. It was only
when one turned to Mt. Monadnock,
ten miles distant, and observed
how plainly he could distinguish
the different colors of the mountain&mdash;the
dark woods, the brown, bare
surfaces, and the slate-colored
rocks&mdash;that, looking at Mt. Wachusett,
and noting its uniform pale
gray outline, he was able to estimate
the real distance of the latter,
so comparatively close at hand did
it appear.</p>

<p>Seated at ease on the smooth
turf on the summit of this “heaven-kissing”
hill, and looking at this
wide and beautiful prospect, one
might repeat to himself Mr. Longfellow’s
lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Pleasant it was, when woods were green</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And winds were soft and low,</div>
<div class="verse">To lie amid some sylvan scene,</div>
<div class="verse">Where, the long, drooping boughs between,</div>
<div class="verse">Shadows dark and sunlight sheen</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Alternate come and go;”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">substituting only for “drooping
boughs” the irregular ranges of
hills.</p>

<p>But descriptions of natural scenery,
if long continued, are wearisome.
Even a Ruskin is read best
in snatches. The mind otherwise
becomes clogged with images. Let
us return, therefore, to animated life.</p>

<p>As Sunday approached, I made
inquiries about the nearest Catholic
church. I found it was at
W&mdash;&mdash;, eight or nine miles distant.
I had no means of getting there
the first Sunday. I retired to my
room and read some chapters of
that sublime and affecting work,
the <cite>Imitation of Christ</cite>, the gift of a
good and beloved mother.</p>

<p>A Catholic is still almost a being
from another moral world in some
of the isolated New Hampshire
villages. Nowhere are the traditions
of Puritanism more zealously
or rigidly maintained. These good
folk seem hardly yet to have emerged
from a fog of wild amazement
that “popish” priests and their followers
should be tolerated by the
selectmen. Not that any overt or
offensive change of manner follows
the announcement that one is a
Catholic&mdash;as I have elsewhere said,
there is a natural or inherited vein
of good manners among the people
that forbids it&mdash;but a momentary
silence reveals to the speaker that
he has stated something strange
and unlooked for. There is an
unmistakable tone of intolerance
manifest, however, in any allusion
to the poorer class of Irish and
French that congregate in the larger
towns, and are sometimes found
in the villages in a wooden-ware
factory, or cutting wood or hemlock-bark,
or doing an odd job of
haymaking. They are looked upon
with dislike and distrust, mixed
with a feeling of contempt. Curious
it is that the native-born New
Englander, with his mind saturated
with hereditary theories of personal
liberty, equality, and fraternity,
should yet evince a more unconquerable
aversion to the foreign
element, which has contributed so
largely to the greatness of the country,
than is shown in European
countries to men of a different race,
unless war has temporarily embittered
national feeling. Yet the explanation
is not hard to find. This
descendant of the Puritan, chained
to the rocky and ungrateful soil his
forefathers won from the Indians
and the wilderness, sees with sullen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
indignation and jealousy the same
rights and privileges which he enjoys
under our free institutions extended
so largely to those of a
different nationality and religion.
In revenge he draws himself more
jealously into his shell. Nor is
this feeling confined to the rich
and refined; it penetrates the mass
of the native-born New England
population.</p>

<p>To speak of lighter things. Society
in L&mdash;&mdash; is eminently aristocratic.
Better, perhaps, it would be
to say that the lines of society are
very strongly marked, and that the
aristocratic element is essentially
conservative.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cortland, the wife of the
New York capitalist, who resides
there three months in the summer,
a stout, refined, tight-gloved, graciously
condescending lady, gives a
metropolitan tone to L&mdash;&mdash; society.
Mr. Cortland, an easy-going, easy-tempered
man in private life, but
reported to be hard as flint in business
matters, seldom finds time to
leave New York, and his visits to
L&mdash;&mdash; are uncertain. His country
house, a large, handsome mansion
with well-kept grounds, croquet-lawn,
coach-house, and stables, is
on the highest ground in the village;
and Mrs. Cortland occupies
without dispute the highest ground
socially. It is an imperial elevation,
after the manner of the saying
attributed to Cæsar. A call
on Mrs. Cortland is the event of
a week, and a return call from
her is a matter not to be lightly
treated. How have I seen this
good Mrs. Allen, my landlady, prepare
her best room for the grand
occasion, and Mrs. Harley speculate
about it with well-assumed indifference
a whole afternoon. One
or two other magnates from Boston,
scattered through L&mdash;&mdash; and adjacent
townships, save Mrs. Cortland
from complete exhaustion by contact
with the village people during
the summer.</p>

<p>Then there is the local aristocracy,
consisting of the wife of the
Congregational pastor <i lang="la">ex-officio</i>, and
Mrs. Parsons, the wife of “Squire”
Parsons, who owns a small bucket-factory
near L&mdash;&mdash;. These two
ladies maintain a strict alliance, offensive
and defensive, with Mrs.
Cortland during the summer. Then
come the middle classes, comprising
Mrs. Allen and Mrs. Harley, the
young doctor’s wife&mdash;a stranger
and somewhat snubbed by the autochthonous
<i lang="fr">élite</i>&mdash;and the well-to-do
farmers’ wives. Finally, we
have the <i lang="la">profanum vulgus</i>, the tail
of L&mdash;&mdash; society, or, to speak
more correctly, those whom society
does not recognize&mdash;some farmers’
wives whose husbands were too
much in debt to allow them to
keep up appearances; one or two
hapless women who sold milk in a
wagon to the neighboring towns, and
drove the wagon themselves; and
the village washerwoman, who went
around doing “chores.” I think I
have exhausted the classification
of the social strata of L&mdash;&mdash;. I
observed that the men eschewed as
much as possible the aristocratic
distinctions made by their wives,
and were apt to resent by silence
or the assumption of an unwonted
bluntness the empty airs and loud
voice with which some vulgar rich
man from a neighboring large town
would sometimes stride through the
village.</p>

<p>Wanderers and waifs, destined apparently
to be at some time drawn
into the great caldron of city life&mdash;perhaps
to their own destruction&mdash;were
not wanting in L&mdash;&mdash;. I
have said that the women were not
remarkable for beauty. But there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
was one exception. A girl belonging
to one of the most destitute
families in the village, by one of
those whims of nature which are
not uncommon, was gifted with a
face and figure to attract even an
unobservant eye, and which seemed
out of place in that quiet and
homely neighborhood. The mother,
a poor, struggling woman with
a growing-up family of all ages,
managed to live somehow by the
days’ work and occasional assistance
given her by the well-to-do
families. The father was living,
but spent most of his time in the
county jail for drunkenness. The
daughter of whom I speak was about
nineteen or twenty years of age;
tall, of fair complexion, with a naturally
elegant carriage and a proud
and almost defiant air, as if she resented
the caprice of fortune which
had placed her in that lowly station.
She had the art of dressing
well with limited means, which
some women possess to the envy
of others. On Sundays and at
picnics she outshone the more expensively-dressed
daughters of the
farmers. She had been, and perhaps
still is, the maid at the village
inn. It may be imagined that gossip
was not idle about this poor
girl, thus singularly placed and dangerously
gifted. Dreadful quarrels
had taken place between the father
and mother about the girl’s staying
at the hotel; the drunken father,
with a true sense of what was becoming,
insisting that she should
leave, the mother as strenuously
maintaining that she should remain.
The beauty of the girl herself was
not of that domestic type I have
elsewhere noticed in the mother
and her babe I saw in Mrs. Allen’s
parlor, but of that showy, restless,
naturally haughty stamp which presaged
storm, perhaps disaster. It
is this class misfortune follows and
the great cities sweep into their
net. Poverty often makes vice of
that which, under happier fortunes,
might have been attractive virtue.
<i lang="la">Absit omen</i>. May this rustic beauty
find a happier, if more homely,
destiny as the wife of some honest
farmer in L&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>The summer passed, week after
week. I fished, I walked, I rode, I
read, I loitered. The barley ripened
on the hill behind the farm-house,
and a golden tint began to spread
over the distant fields. The apples
grew large and ruddy on one side
where the sun struck the laden
branch in the orchard. The tassels
of the corn showed purple. August
blazed. The doves flew thirstily to
the large blue pump, and perched
on the edges of the horse-trough
after the farmer watered his horse
at mid-day. The bees hummed
three at a time in the big yellow
cups of the squash-vines. Have
you ever observed of that homely
vegetable how ingeniously and dexterously
it fastens its daring and
aggressive vines to the ground as it
shoots out over the close-cut grass?
Stoop down among the after-math,
or rowen, as it is called in New
Hampshire, and you will see that
at the inosculation of each successive
joint of the vine, where it
throws out its tendrils and blossoms,
it also thrusts forth slender,
white, curling ligaments that twist,
each of them, tightly around a tiny
tuft of the short grass. Thus it
moors itself, as if by so many delicate
living cables, to the bosom of
the life-giving earth.</p>

<p>I might, if space allowed, tell
of my fishing ventures, and how
one glorious morning we rode out
of L&mdash;&mdash; in a big yellow wagon
with three horses&mdash;a party of seven
of us, ladies and gentlemen, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
the village&mdash;to make the ascent of
Mt. Monadnock. This is the lion
of all the country round. Parties
are made up every week to climb
its rugged summit. Over the hills
and rolling ground we gaily rattled.
Through the sandy country roads,
where the branches of the trees met
overhead and made dim aisles of
verdure, we smoothly sped. And
then what panting, laughing, climbing,
shrill screaming, as we toiled
up the winding path from the half-way
house to the top of the mountain!
What a magnificent, boundless
view repaid us! The day was
clear. To the north, Mt. Kearsarge
and rolling ranges of mountains;
to the southeast, a diversified
surface of country spreading onwards
far as the eye could reach
towards the unseen ocean; to the
south, Mt. Wachusett; below us
woods, valleys, and lakes. A feeling
of awe creeps over one in these
mountain solitudes.</p>

<p>As to the fishing, I will confess
that to me, who had thrown a fly
over more than one Canadian river,
and had killed my twenty-pound
salmon on the Nipisiquit, loafing
with a pole in a boat over a lily-covered
pond for a half-pound pickerel
was not tremendously exciting
sport. But what mattered it? The
mornings were soft and wooing;
the woods were full of mysterious
shadows; the water was limpid as
if Diana and her nymphs bathed
there in the spectral moonlight.
Life passed smoothly and agreeably.
I sought no more.</p>

<p>The blackberries began to ripen,
first one by one and then in sable
clusters, in the pastures. The days
were growing shorter. The twilight
sank more quickly into night.
September approached, and I began
to look for the appearance of
my friend Jones. I had seen Miss
Cortland two or three times coming
from or going to the meeting-house
on Sunday mornings, when all the
beauty and fashion of L&mdash;&mdash; for
miles around rode up in buggies,
carryalls, or open wagons; but I
had never met her to be introduced
to her&mdash;a little imperial beauty,
with a fresh and rosy color, and a
mouth shaped like Cupid’s bow,
that needed only to smile to conquer.</p>

<p>On a bright September morning,
when the surrounding atmosphere
was clear as a bell, but a thin
haze still clung about Mt. Monadnock
and the far-off mountains,
Jones rode over on the stage-coach
from the railroad station and joined
me at L&mdash;&mdash;. He asked eagerly
about Miss Cortland.</p>

<p>Was she in the village?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Had I met her?</p>

<p>No; but I had seen her two or
three times.</p>

<p>What did I think of her?</p>

<p>Well, I thought her pretty
enough to excuse a little wildness
of imagination on his part. He
would be a lucky fellow if he got
her and some of her father’s money
or a position in his business!</p>

<p>Did I think he would give up
his Art so easily?</p>

<p>“My dear Jones,” I replied, “I
don’t want to appear cold-blooded,
or to dash your enthusiasm for
your art in the least; but, to speak
candidly, I should not be surprised
if you did some day under sufficient
temptation&mdash;the prospect of
marrying Miss Cortland, for example.”</p>

<p>Jones declared his intention of
calling on Miss Cortland that very
day. He had a sketch-book full
of studies, spirited, but many of
them mere hints. He came back
before dinner, full of life, and proposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
a score of schemes for to-morrow.
He made a sort of small
whirlwind in my quiet life. Mrs.
Cortland had received him civilly,
but he thought a little coolly. But
he had seen Agnes, and had spoken
a few words to her that might mean
much or little as they were taken,
and he was happy&mdash;rather boisterously
happy, perhaps, as a young
fellow will be at such times&mdash;full
of jokes, and refusing to see a
cloud on his horizon.</p>

<p>Jones fell easily into our farm-house
ways, though he was apt to
steal off in the mornings to play
croquet on the Cortlands’ lawn
with Miss Cortland and Miss Parsons,
and any other friend they
could get to join them.</p>

<p>One afternoon, when the sun was
getting low and a southerly wind
blowing, we started to try for some
fish at a pond about half an hour’s
walk from the house. As we turned
off the highway into a by-road
covered with grass that led to the
pond, I saw Miss Cortland standing
on the rising ground some distance
before us. She was looking
from us towards the sinking sun,
now veiled in quick-drifting clouds.
Her dog, a large, powerful animal,
a cross between a Newfoundland
and Mount St. Bernard, was
crouched at her feet. Some vague
thoughts about Una and her lion
flitted through my mind. But I
was more struck by the way the
light touched her figure, standing
out motionless against the gray sky.
It reminded me very much of the
general effect of a painting by a
foreign artist&mdash;Kammerer, I think
it was&mdash;that I saw at the exhibition
of the Boston Art Club last
year. It was the picture of a girl
standing on a pier on the French
coast, looking out to sea. Her
golden hair was slightly stirred by
the breeze, her lips a little parted,
and there was a far-away look in
her eyes, as if she may have expected
a lover to be coming over the
sea in one of the yachts that lined
the horizon. The dress of the girl
and the stone-work of the pier
were both white. It was a good
example of the striking effects produced
by the free use of a great
deal of almost staring white, which
is a favorite device of the latest
school of French art.</p>

<p>As we advanced, the dog growled
and rose, but, recognizing Jones,
wagged his tail inoffensively as we
drew nearer. Miss Cortland turned
towards us.</p>

<p>“Shall I introduce you?” said
Jones.</p>

<p>“No,” I said. “I’ll go on to
the pond. I’ll see you to-night.”</p>

<p>Jones advanced, hat in hand.
“What happy fortune,” he said,
addressing her, “has led me to
meet the goddess of these woods?”
Then, altering his tone, he added
in a bantering way: “I see you
have been poaching on our preserves,
Miss Cortland. But I do
wonder at your taste, fishing for
eels!” pointing to a small basket
on her arm from which hung some
of the long stems of the pond-lily.
This he said to vex her, knowing
her horror of those creatures.
“Eels?” she exclaimed indignantly,
with a tone and gesture of aversion
at the thought. “They are
pond-lilies.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that is very well to say,”
replied Jones, “when you have the
lid of the basket down to hide
them; but I insist upon their
being eels unless you show them
to me.”</p>

<p>By this time I was out of hearing.
I left them together, and kept
on down the road to the pond.</p>

<p>That night Jones came into my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
room with a quieter manner than
usual. He was evidently very
happy, but his happiness had a
sobering effect upon him. He told
me that he had made a plain avowal
of his feelings to Agnes Cortland as
they walked home together, and that
he had won from her the confession
that she loved him and had not
been indifferent to him before he
left for Europe. I wished him joy
of his good-fortune, though I could
foresee plainly enough that his difficulties
had only begun. For a
little time these two innocent young
souls&mdash;for Jones I knew to be singularly
unsullied by the world for
a man of his age&mdash;would enjoy
their paradise undisturbed together.
Then would come maternal explanations,
and the father’s authority
would be invoked. A solemn promise
would be exacted from her to
see him no more. Miss Cortland
was much attached to her parents,
who would be sincerely anxious for
her welfare. She would not make
much resistance. Some day there
would come a storm of tears, and
poor Jones’s letters and the ring
he gave her would be returned to
him by a faithful messenger, and a
little note, blotted with tears, asking
him to forgive her and praying
for his happiness. This must be
the end. A year or two of separation
and a summer and winter in
Europe with her parents would
leave nothing more than a little sad
memory of her brief New Hampshire
romance; and in five years
she would be married to some
foreigner of distinction or successful
man of business, and would be
a happy wife and mother. As for
poor Jones, he would probably be
heard of at rare intervals for a year
or two as a trader on the Pacific
coast or prospecting a claim in
Nevada. But men like him, vigorous,
powerful, well equipped in
body and temper for the struggle
with the world, are not kept down
long by such disappointments.
The storm is fierce, and leaves its
scars after it; but the man rises
above it, and is more closely knit
thereafter. Jones will make his
mark in the world of business, if
not of art.</p>

<p>No unwelcome prophecies of mine,
however, disturbed his happiness for
those few days. I let events take
their course. Why should I interrupt
his dream by Cassandra-like anticipations
of woe, which would have
been resented as a reflection upon
the constancy of his idol? I know
that they met frequently for the
following three or four days. Then
came the packing up for departure.
My long holiday was over.</p>

<p>On a foggy morning in September
we steamed up the Sound on a
Fall River boat. Through Hell
Gate the stately boat sped on her
way, past Blackwell’s Island, and
across the bows of the Brooklyn
ferry-boats, crowded with passengers
for the city in the early morning.
Around the Battery we swept,
into the North River, and slowly
swung alongside of Pier 28. Then
the hackmen yelled at us; our
coach stuck at the corner of the
street; a jam followed; the drivers
swore; the policemen shouted and
threatened; the small boys grinned
and dodged between the horses;
and a ward politician, with a ruby
nose, looked on complacently from
the steps of a corner “sample”
room. In one word, we were in
New York, and our village life
in Hampshire was a thing of the
past.</p>

<h3>THE PALATINE PRELATES OF ROME.</h3>

<p>Whatever is connected with our
Holy Father must have an interest
for Catholics; and at the present
time especially it would seem desirable
to know something about
the origin and functions of those
faithful prelates of whom this article
treats, and with some of whom
American visitors to Rome may be
likely to have relations. They are
called palatine prelates because
lodged in the same palace as the
sovereign, and in these days of
trouble are the nearest to his most
sacred Majesty in his solitude and
sufferings. They are four in number,
and belong to the pope’s intimate
court and confidence, their
names being registered in the Roman
<cite>Notizie</cite> immediately after those
of the palatine cardinals among the
members of the pontifical family.</p>

<h4>MAGGIORDOMO.</h4>

<p>The majordomo, called in good
Latin, the official language of the
church, <i lang="la">Magister Domus Papæ</i>, is
the first of these prelates and one of
the highest dignitaries of the Holy
See. The chief of the royal palace
has had in all countries immense influence
and power; and in France
and Scotland, at least, the <i lang="fr">Maires
du palais</i> and stewards succeeded
in mounting the throne. This officer,
who, like the other three, is
always a clergyman, is the high
steward of his Holiness and master
of his household, remaining day
and night conveniently near to the
Pope’s person, of which he has the
special care, and for the safety of
which he is responsible to the
Sacred College. Until the present
reign he was supreme under the
sovereign, in the civil, military, and
ecclesiastical affairs of the court,
having his own tribunal of civil and
criminal jurisdiction.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> Some years
ago, however, a part of the prerogatives
of this office was transferred
to the Cardinal Secretary of State;
but even now the majordomo is at
the head of the administration of
the palace in which the Pope may
reside for the time being, and on a
vacancy of the see is <i lang="la">ex-officio</i>, by a
decree of Clement XII. in 1732,
governor of the conclave.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> In this
latter capacity, by a natural order
of things which cannot be long delayed
(yet God grant it may!), he
will have to act a part during one of
the most critical periods in the history
of Christian Rome. He has the
privilege<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> for life of using the pope’s
arms with his own, and consequently
retains this heraldic distinction
even after he has been promoted to
the cardinalate to which his office
surely leads, sooner or later, according
to a court custom that began in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
the middle of the XVIIth century.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
The origin of this office is involved
in some doubt, owing to its antiquity.
It must have been that, in the
palace given to Pope Melchiades
by the Emperor Constantine, some
person conspicuous for piety and
prudence was appointed to keep
the members of a large and constantly-increasing
court in mutual
harmony and subjection to authority,
while relieving the pontiff of the
immediate superintendence of his
household, and leaving him free to
give his precious time to public
and more important matters. At
all events, at a very early period
after this there is mentioned among
the officers attached to the <i lang="la">Patriarchium
Lateranense</i>&mdash;as the old
<i lang="la">Ædes Lateranæ</i> were then called&mdash;a
<i lang="la">Vice-dominus</i>, who was chosen from
the Roman clergy, and was often, as
the more modern prelates have
been, invested with the episcopal
dignity. He was answerable for
the good order and harmonious administration
of the palace; and the
extent of that portion of it in which
he dwelt and had his offices, as well
as held his court of jurisdiction
over the papal domestics,<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> must
have been large, since it was called
the <i lang="la">vicedominium</i>; and although
his successor fifteen hundred years
later has not the same ample powers
that he enjoyed, he is still a
personage so considerable that the
part of the Vatican in which he resides
is known officially as the
<i lang="it">Maggiordomato</i>. The earliest name
(not title) of such an officer which
has come down to us is that of a
certain priest Ampliatus, who is
mentioned in the year 544 as having
accompanied Pope Vigilius to
Constantinople for the affair of
the Three Chapters, and being detached
from the pontiff’s suite at
Sicily on their way back, with
orders to hurry on to Rome, where
the concerns of the Lateran seem
to have suffered by his absence.
Anatolius, a deacon, held the office
under S. Gregory the Great, who
was very particular to have only
virtuous and learned men about
him; and in 742 Benedict, a bishop,
held it under S. Zachary, who sent
him on a mission to Luitprand, King
of the Lombards. This officer is
mentioned for the last time in history
as <i lang="la">Vice-dominus</i> in the year 1044,
when an archdeacon Benedict served
under Benedict IX. After this
period, those who held the analogous
position were styled chamberlains
of the Holy Roman Church until
1305, when, the court being at Avignon,
a large share of their duties
and privileges was given to a nobleman
of high standing, who was called
<i lang="it">Maestro del sacro Ospizio</i>.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>Under Alexander V., in 1409,
the Holy Father having returned to
Rome, mention is made for the
first time, in a paper drawn up for
the guidance of the court, of a prefect
of the apostolic palace&mdash;<i lang="la">Magister
domus pontificiæ</i>&mdash;who was the
same as the later majordomo, the
name only having been changed
by Urban VIII. in 1626. The series
of these high prelates, to the
number of 99&mdash;belonging generally
to the very first nobility of Italy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
and showing such illustrious names
as Colonna, Gonzaga, Farnese,
Frangipani, Visconti, Acquaviva,
Cybo, Cenci, Caraffa, Pico della
Mirandola, Piccolomini, Borghese,
Borromeo, etc.&mdash;begins with Alexander
Mirabelli, a Neapolitan, who
was named to the office by Pius II.
in the month of August, 1458.</p>

<h4>MAESTRO DI CAMERA.</h4>

<p>This officer, whose official title
in Latin is <i lang="la">Prefectus cubiculi Sanctitatis
suæ</i>, is the second palatine
prelate. He is the grand chamberlain
of his Holiness, carries out the
entire court ceremonial, and has
the supervision of all audiences, as
well as admittances of whatever
kind to the presence of the Pope.
How important and confidential is
this post which he holds at the
door of the papal chambers may
best be judged from the single fact
that no one can approach the sovereign
without his knowledge in
all and his consent<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> in most cases.
He has sometimes the episcopal
character&mdash;in truth, was usually in
times past an archbishop <i lang="la">in partibus</i>;
but it is now more customary
for him to be simply in priest’s orders.
If, however, he be not already
a prelate of high rank, he is always,
immediately after his nomination
to the office, made an apostolic
prothonotary, with precedence over
all his brethren in that ancient and
honorable college. Like his immediate
superior, he has the privilege
of quartering the Pope’s arms with
his own. He is the keeper of the
Fisherman’s ring, and at the Pope’s
death delivers it up to the cardinal
chamberlain of the Holy Roman
College, who gives him a notarial
receipt for it. This celebrated
ring is the official one of the popes,
and gets its name from having the
figure of S. Peter in a bark and
casting his net into the sea engraved
upon it. Above this figure is
cut the name of the reigning pontiff.
It is the first among the rings,
but the second in the class of seals,
since it only serves as the privy
seal or signet used on apostolic
briefs and matters of subordinate
consequence,<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> whereas the Great
Seal is used to impress the heads
of SS. Peter and Paul in lead (sometimes,
but rarely, in gold) on papal
bulls. At first this ring was a private
and not an official one of the
pope; for in a letter from Perugia
of March 7, 1265, addressed by
Clement IV. to his nephew Peter Le
Gros, he says that he writes to him
and to his other relatives, not <i lang="la">sub
bulla, sed sub piscatoris sigillo, quo
Romani Pontifices in suis secretis utuntur</i>;
from which we gather that
the ring was in use some time before,
but by whom introduced is
unknown, as is also the precise
period when it became official,
although this happened during one
or other of the XVth century pontificates.
Perhaps the first time
that the now familiar expression,
“Given under the Fisherman’s
ring,” is met with in the manner
of a formal statement or curial formula,
such as it has been ever since
retained, is in a document of Nicholas
V. dated from Rome&mdash;<i lang="la">Datum
Romæ</i>&mdash;on the 15th of April, 1448.</p>

<p>The institution of this office is
extremely ancient, but, like most
others of the court, it has had different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
names and increased or diminished
attributions at various periods.
The modern Romans take a legitimate
pride in being able to deduce
many of their great court offices from
the corresponding ones of the Cæsars,
to whom their sovereign has
succeeded. Thus this officer is
sometimes called in classical Latin
<i lang="la">Magister admissionum</i>, such an one
being mentioned by the historian
Ammianus Marcellinus (xv. 5);
and his office <i lang="la">Officium admissionis</i>,
which is found in Suetonius’ <cite>Life of
Vespasian</cite> (xiv.) Among the members
of the household of S. Gregory
the Great in the year 601 there
was a certain (S.) Paterius, <i lang="la">Secundicerius</i>
of the Holy See (corresponding
to the modern sub-dean of the
apostolic prothonotaries, the dean
being <i lang="la">Primicerius</i>). He had to
make known to the pope the names
of those who solicited the favor of
an interview; and it is probable
that he also gave (as is now given)
along with the name some account
of the quality and business of the
visitor, for fear that the pontiff
should be unnecessarily intruded
upon or brought in contact with
unworthy and perhaps dangerous
characters. Investigators into the
origin of the offices of the Holy See
have fixed upon this person as the
remote predecessor of the present
<i lang="it">Maestro di Camera</i>; but all the
charges of the palace having been
remodelled and placed nearly on
their present footing about four
hundred and fifty years ago, and
many of the court records having
been lost or stolen during the disturbed
era between the pontificates
of Clement V. (1305) and Martin
V. (1417)&mdash;which includes the periods
of Avignon and the schism&mdash;the
authentic roll of the holders of
these high offices of state rarely
begins earlier than the XVth century.
Thus the first grand chamberlain
of the modern series is
Bindaccio Ricasoli of Florence,
who was <i lang="la">Magister aulæ palatii</i> to
John XXIII. in 1410. The present
one is Monsignor Ricci-Paracciani,
a Roman, who, however,
has become majordomo by Monsignor
Pacca’s promotion. The
<i lang="it">Maestro di Camera</i>, being constantly
in company with exalted personages
who seek an audience of
the Holy Father and wait their
turn in, or at all events pass through,
the <i lang="it">Anticamera nobile</i>, which opens
immediately into the Pope’s reception-room,
must be distinguished
for good breeding and courtliness,
and serve as a model to his subordinates
in that august apartment,
lest it be said of him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“His manners had not the repose</div>
<div class="verse">That marks the caste of Vere de Vere.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Hence we are prepared to find the
noblest families of Italy represented
in the office, and notice such
patrician names as Odescalchi, Altieri,
Fieschi, Ruffo, Doria, Massimo,
Pignatelli, Caracciolo, Barberini,
Riario-Sforza, etc.</p>

<h4>UDITORE.</h4>

<p>The auditor of his Holiness&mdash;<i lang="la">Auditor
Papæ</i>&mdash;is the agent-general,
most intimate privy councillor,
and canonist of the Pope. He is
third in rank of the palatine prelates,
and lived in the Quirinal,
where his offices and the archives
were situated, until the present iniquitous
occupation, since which
they have been removed to the
Torlonia palace, near the Vatican.
This office was instituted by Paul
II. (1464-1471), and the first to
hold it was the renowned J. B.
Millini, a Roman, who was at the
same time Bishop of Urbino (which
was administered by some one else
in his name); he later became a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
cardinal under Sixtus IV., in 1476.
His successor at the present time
is Monsignor Sagretti. Up to this
century the power and general influence
of the auditor were extraordinary,
since he had a court of
justice and ample jurisdiction,
even exercising in the name of the
Pope the supremacy of appeal in
many matters. For this reason
the great epigraphist Morcelli, who
wrote before these judicial functions
were abolished, called him
<i lang="la">Judex sacrarum cognitionum</i>. Formerly
he gave audience to all comers
about matters of equity and
appeal on Tuesdays, in his apartment
at the Quirinal, standing in
his prelatic robes behind a low-backed
throne supposed by a sort
of fiction to be then occupied by
the Pope;<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> hence he was called in
choice Latin <i lang="la">Cognoscens vice sacrâ</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
in <i lang="fr">lieu</i> of his Holiness. The
common Italian appellation <i lang="it">Uditore
Santissimo</i> is only a corrupt rendering
of the Latin <i lang="la">Auditor Sanctissimi</i>.
This post has always been
occupied by one of the ablest jurists
in Italy; and even now the
auditor must be both very learned
and most incorruptible, from the
part that he takes officially in filling
vacant sees and making other
important nominations.</p>

<h4>MAESTRO DEL SACRO PALAZZO.</h4>

<p>The Master of the Holy Apostolic
Palace&mdash;<i lang="la">Magister Sacri Palatii
Apostolici</i>&mdash;is one of the most distinguished
members for piety and
doctrine of the Dominican Order.
He is the Pope’s official theologian,
and usually a consultor of several
Roman congregations, more nearly
concerned with matters of faith and
morals, as the Inquisition, Indulgences
and Relics, Index, etc. He
ranks fourth among the palatine
prelates, and resided until the late
invasion in the Quirinal Palace
with his “companion” and two lay
brothers of his order. He is considered
an honorary auditor of the
Rota, and as such has a place with
the prelates of this class in the
papal chapels and reunions. He
retains the habit of his order, but
wears on his hat a black prelatical
band. He is <i lang="la">ex-officio</i> president of
the Theological Faculty in the Roman
University, and the person to
whom was entrusted the censorship
of the press. The origin of this
office dates from the year 1218,
when S. Dominic, who established
the Order of Friars Preachers, suggested
to Honorius III. that it
would be proper if some one were
charged to give religious instruction
to the many servants of cardinals,
prelates, and others, who used to
spend their time idly in useless
talk and slanderous gossip with
their brethren of the papal palace
while their masters were expecting
an audience or engaged with his
Holiness.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> The Pope was pleased,
and at once appointed Dominic to
the good work, who began by explaining
the Epistles of S. Paul.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
The fruit of these pious conferences
was so apparent that the
pope determined to perpetuate
them under the direction of a
Dominican. Besides the more familiar
instructions, which were
given at first extempore, it was
arranged later that while the pope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
and court were listening to the
preacher appointed to sermonize
in the palace during Advent and
Lent, the papal domestics and
other servants should also have
the benefit of formal discourses,
but in another part of the building.
It was always the father <em>master</em>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
doctor&mdash;who held forth to
them until the XVIth century,
when the duties of his office becoming
more onerous, especially
by reason of the many attempts
to misuse the recently-discovered
art of printing to corrupt faith and
morals in Rome itself, the obligation
devolved upon his companion&mdash;<i lang="la">Pro-Magister</i>
or <i lang="la">Socius</i>&mdash;who
also holds three days of catechism
in preparation for each of the four
general communions that are given
yearly in the palace. This deputy
is appointed by the master, and is
a person of consequence, succeeding
sometimes to the higher office.
The present master is Vincenzo
Maria Gatti. When the learned
Alexander V. became pope (1409),
the Master of the Palace was required
to stand by at his meals,
especially on Sundays and festival
days, and be ready to propose
difficult points of debate, or to
enter into an argument on any
matter and with any person present
as the Holy Father should
command.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> There have been
seventy-nine occupants of this
office since its institution (not to
count several anti-masters created
by anti-popes), of whom seventeen
have been made cardinals, and
among them the celebrated church
historian Orsi. The great writer
on Christian antiquities, Mamachi,
held this office with distinction.
It is one, of course, in which
“brains” rather than “blood” find
a place; and since there is no
royal road to learning&mdash;for as an
old monkish couplet says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Gutta cavat lapidem, non vi, sed sæpe cadendo,</div>
<div class="verse">Sic homo fit doctus, non vi, sed sæpe studendo”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;we are not surprised that the series
of Masters of the Apostolic Palace
exhibits no such names as those
that predominate among the chamberlains
and majordomos&mdash;“Not
many noble” (1 Cor. i. 26).</p>

<p>In the mother-church of the
Dominican Order at Rome, <i lang="it">Santa
Maria sopra Minerva</i>, which is
also the title of the first American
cardinal,<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> there is a special vault
beneath the chapel of S. Dominic
for the entombment of the masters;
but the brutal invaders who now
hold possession of Rome having
forbidden all intra-mural burials&mdash;evidently
through malice, because,
from the dry nature of the soil and
the perfection of Roman masonry,
there could not be the slightest
danger from a moderate number
of interments within the city&mdash;they
will have to sleep after death in
some less appropriate spot: “How
long shall sinners, O Lord, how long
shall sinners glory?… Thy
people, O Lord, they have brought
low: and they have afflicted thy inheritance”
(Ps. xciii.)</p>

<h3>POWER, ACTION, AND MOVEMENT.</h3>

<p>The word “motion” is now
commonly used for movement, but
it properly means the action by
which a thing is set into movement.
This action, or motion, of course
proceeds from an agent, and consists
in the production of an act,
or momentum, which must be terminated
or received in a patient.
The active power of the agent is its
substantial act as virtually containing
in itself all the acts which the
agent is ready to produce, according
to its nature. This active
power may therefore be called the
virtuality, or terminability, of the
act by which the agent is. The momentum
produced by such a power
stands to the power in the same
ontological relation as the <em>now</em> of
time to the virtuality of God’s
eternity, and as the ubication of a
point in space to the virtuality of
God’s immensity; for in all these
cases there is question of nothing
else than of an extrinsic terminability
and an extrinsic term. We may,
therefore, in treating of motive
powers and momentums, follow the
same order of questions which we
have followed in our articles on
space and duration.</p>

<p>But the subject which we are
about to investigate has a special
feature of its own; because in the
exertion of active power, and consequently
in the momentums produced,
there is something&mdash;<em>intensity</em>&mdash;which
is not to be met with either
in the <em>when</em> or in the <em>where</em>. For
the <em>when</em> and the <em>where</em> are mere
terms of intervals or distances, and
do not partake in their continuity;
from which it follows that they are
not quantities, but merely terms of
quantities, whereas the momentum
of motion is the formal principle of
the real changes produced by the
agent in the patient. And these
changes admit of different degrees,
and thus by their greater or less
magnitude reveal the greater or less
intensity of the exertion. The reason
of this difference is very plain;
for the <em>when</em> and the <em>where</em> are not
efficiently produced by God’s eternity
and immensity, for these divine
attributes do not connote
action. Their origin is not to be
traced to action, but to resultation,
as we have explained in our preceding
articles. The entity of
every creature, on the contrary,
proceeds from God as efficient
cause&mdash;that is, it does not merely
result from the existence of other
things, but it is actively produced;
and, since an act produced must
have some degree of perfection,
creatures are more or less perfect
as to their entity, and therefore
have in their own act a greater or
less power of acting, according to
the degree of their entitative perfection.
This explains why it is
that there is intensity in all action
and in all act produced, whereas
there is no intensity in the <em>when</em>
and the <em>where</em>.</p>

<p>But, apart from this special feature,
the questions regarding active
powers, actions, and the acts produced
are entirely similar to those
which we have answered in treating
of space and of duration. Nay,
more, the same questions may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
viewed under three distinct aspects&mdash;viz.,
first, with reference to the
divine power and its causality of
contingent things; secondly, with
reference to second causes, their
actions, and the momentums produced
by them; and, thirdly, with
reference to these momentums
themselves and the local movements
resulting from them. This
third view of the subject is the only
one immediately connected with
the notions of space and of time,
and we might limit ourselves to its
consideration. Nevertheless, to
shed more light on the whole
treatise, we propose to say something
of the other two also; for,
by tracing the actions and the phenomena
of the material world to
their original sources, we shall discover
that all different grades of
reality are linked with their immediate
principles in such a manner
as to exhibit a perpetual analogy
of the lower with the higher, till we
reach the highest&mdash;God.</p>

<p>To ascertain the truth of this
proposition, let us recall to mind
the main conclusions established
by us with respect to space. They
were as follows:</p>

<p>1st. There is void space&mdash;that is,
a capacity which does not imply the
presence of anything created.</p>

<p>2d. Void space is an objective
reality.</p>

<p>3d. Void space was not created.</p>

<p>4th. Absolute space is the virtuality,
or extrinsic terminability,
of God’s immensity.</p>

<p>5th. Absolute space is not modified
by the presence of matter in
it&mdash;that is, by its extrinsic termination.</p>

<p>6th. Ubications are extrinsic
terms of absolute space, and their
relations have in space itself an
extrinsic foundation.</p>

<p>A similar series of conclusions
was established in regard to duration.
They were:</p>

<p>1st. There is a standing duration&mdash;that
is, an actuality which does
not imply succession.</p>

<p>2d. Standing duration is an objective
reality.</p>

<p>3d. Standing duration is not created.</p>

<p>4th. Standing duration is the
virtuality, or extrinsic terminability,
of God’s eternity.</p>

<p>5th. Standing duration is not
modified by the existence in it of
created things&mdash;that is, by its extrinsic
termination.</p>

<p>6th. The <em>whens</em> of creatures are
extrinsic terms of standing duration,
and their relations have in
standing duration their extrinsic
foundation.</p>

<p>Before we give the analogous
conclusions concerning active
powers and their causality, we
have to premise that all power
ready to act is said to be <i lang="la">in actu
primo</i>, or in the “first act,” with
respect to its termination and term,
or act, which it is ready to produce.
Its action is its termination,
and it consists in the causation of
a <em>second act</em>. This second act, inasmuch
as it exists in its proper
term, potency, or subject, is called
<i lang="la">actio in facto esse</i>&mdash;that is, an action
wholly complete, though the action
proper is always <i lang="la">in fieri</i>; for it consists
in the very production of such
a second act, as we have just stated.
The result of this production is the
existence of a new reality, substantial
or accidental, according to the
nature of the act produced. This
well-known terminology we shall
use here for the parallel development
of the three classes of questions
which we have to answer.</p>

<p><i>Origin of Power.</i>&mdash;First, then,
with regard to the primary origin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
of active and moving powers, we lay
down the following conclusions:</p>

<p>1st. There is some absolute
power&mdash;that is, a first act which has
no need of producing any second
act.</p>

<p>2d. Absolute power is an objective
reality.</p>

<p>3d. Absolute power is uncreated.</p>

<p>4th. Absolute power is the virtuality,
or extrinsic terminability,
of the act by which God is.</p>

<p>5th. Absolute power is not modified
by the production of effects&mdash;that
is, by its extrinsic termination.</p>

<p>6th. The beings thus produced
are extrinsic terms of God’s power;
and although, owing to their intrinsic
perfection, which may be greater
or less, they can be related to one
another by an intrinsic foundation,
yet their “entitative distances”
have only an extrinsic foundation&mdash;to
wit, God’s omnipotence.</p>

<p>Some of these propositions are so
obvious that they might have been
omitted but for the object we have
in view of pointing out the parallelism
of absolute power with space
and duration.</p>

<p>The first of these conclusions is
proved thus: All first act which
naturally needs to produce some
second act has an intrinsic and
natural ordination to something distinct
from itself; for all effect is
really distinct from its efficient
principle. But it cannot be admitted
without absurdity that every
first act has such an intrinsic and
natural ordination; for, if everything
were thus ordained to something
else, all things would tend to
some subordinate end, while there
would be no supreme end at all;
for nothing that is ordained to
something else can rank as the supreme
end. On the other hand,
no subordinate ends can be admitted
without a supreme end. And
therefore there must be some first
act which has no intrinsic necessity
of producing any second act. Such
a first act is altogether absolute.</p>

<p>The second conclusion is evident.
For what we call here “a first act”
is not an imperfect and incomplete
act, since it needs no termination;
nor is it a result of mental abstraction
and analysis, but a perfect
principle of real operations; for the
epithet “first,” by which we characterize
it, does not imply that it
lacks anything in its entity, but, on
the contrary, it means that it already
contains eminently the whole reality
of the effects which it is competent
to produce. Hence it is clear
that, if such effects are objective
realities, the first act on which their
production depends is an objective
reality, and a much better one
too.</p>

<p>The third conclusion needs no
proof, it being evident that whatever
is created must tend to the
end of its creation, which is the
manifestation of the perfections of
its creator. This manifestation implies
action&mdash;viz., a transition of the
first act to its second act. Accordingly,
a first act which has no
necessary ordination to second acts
cannot be created.</p>

<p>The fourth conclusion follows
from the third, since an uncreated
act can be nothing else than the
act by which God is. This act, inasmuch
as it eminently contains the
reality of all possible things, is extrinsically
terminable, and as thus
terminable it exhibits itself as a
“first” act. But, since God has
no need of creatures, such a first
act has no need of extrinsic terminations,
and, as first, it constitutes
omnipotence, or God’s absolute
power. This power in its infinite
simplicity has an infinite range, as
it extends to all conceivable reality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p>The fifth conclusion will be
easily understood by reflecting that
the extrinsic termination of active
power consists in giving existence
to contingent things by efficient action.
Now, to act efficiently does
not bring about any intrinsic change
in the agent; for all intrinsic change
follows from passion, which is the
opposite of action. Nor does God,
when giving existence and active
powers to any number of creatures,
weaken his own power. For the
power imparted to creatures is not
a portion of the divine power, but a
product of creation, and nothing, in
fact, but the created act itself. For,
as all contingent things are created
for the manifestation of God’s perfections,
all creatures must be active;
and as everything acts as it
is in act, the act being the principle
of the acting, it follows that all
act produced by creation is an active
power of greater or less perfection
according to the part it is destined
to fill in the plans of its
Maker. This shows that the act
by which a creature is, bears a resemblance
to the act by which God
is, inasmuch as it virtually contains
in itself all those acts which it is
fit to produce according to its nature.
But, since all contingent act
is extrinsic to God, divine omnipotence
is not entitatively and intrinsically
more actuated by creation
than by non-creation; though, if
God creates any being, from the
term produced he will acquire the
real denomination of Creator. Thus
the existence of a contingent being
is the existence of a real term, which
extrinsically terminates the virtuality
of God’s act, in which it is eminently
contained. Its relation to
its Creator is one of total dependence;
whilst God’s relation to it is
that of first causality. The foundation
of this relation is the action
which proceeds from God and terminates
in the creature.</p>

<p>The first part of the sixth conclusion,
that beings produced by creation
are extrinsic terms of God’s
power, has just been explained.
But we say, moreover, that the entitative
distances between such beings
have an extrinsic foundation
in God’s omnipotence. By “entitative
distance” we mean the difference
in degree between distinct
beings&mdash;<i>v.g.</i>, between a man and a
tree&mdash;as we have explained in another
place.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> And we say that, as
the distance between two material
points in space has its extrinsic
foundation in the virtuality of
God’s immensity, so also the entitative
distance of two beings has
its extrinsic foundation in the virtuality
of God’s infinite act&mdash;that is,
in divine omnipotence. In fact,
the different degrees of entity conceivable
between the tree and the
man are all virtually contained in
God’s omnipotence, just as all the
distinct ubications possible between
two points are virtually in
God’s immensity. Hence the foundation
of such entitative distances
is extrinsic to the beings compared
in the same manner as the foundation
of local distances.</p>

<p>But the terms produced by creative
action, inasmuch as they possess
a greater or less perfection in
their individual constitution, can
be compared with one another according
to the relative degree of
their intrinsic reality; and thus,
besides the extrinsic relation just
mentioned, they have a mutual relativity
arising from an intrinsic
foundation. The relative degree
of reality of a contingent being
becomes known to us through the
relative intensity of its active power;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
which implies that the beings
compared have powers of the same
species. If they are not of the
same species, the comparison will
give no result.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Before leaving this
part of our subject, we have to
notice that, as the ubication, so
also the act produced by creation,
can be considered both absolutely
and respectively. A created act,
considered absolutely, is an act intrinsically
completed by its essential
potency, and constitutes the
being as it is <i lang="la">in actu secundo</i>. The
same act, considered respectively,
or as ordained to something else,
is a power ready to act, and thus it
is <i lang="la">in actu primo</i> with regard to all
the acts which it is able to produce.</p>

<p>The essential act of a contingent
being, be it considered absolutely
or respectively, bears no proportion
to the perfection of its Creator,
no more indeed than a point
in space to immensity, or a <em>now</em> of
time to eternity. Hence all contingent
act or power, whatever be
its perfection or intensity, as compared
with God, is like nothing.
It is only when a created act or
power is compared with another of
the same kind that we can establish
a proportion between them as
to degrees of perfection and of intensity.
These degrees are measured
by comparing the relative intensities
of the effects produced by
distinct causes of the same kind,
acting under the same conditions.</p>

<p>The quantity of efficient power
may be conceived as a virtual sum
of degrees of power. In this particular
the quantity of power differs
entirely from the quantity of distance;
because this latter cannot
be conceived as a virtual sum of
ubications. The reason of this
difference is that ubications, as
being simple points, have no quantity,
and therefore cannot by addition
make up a continuous quantity;
whereas the degrees of power
always possess intensity, and
are quantities; hence their sum is
a quantity of the same kind.</p>

<p>It may be useful to remark that
all continuous quantity has a necessary
connection with the quantity
of power, and that all extension
owes its being to the efficacy
of some motive principle. In fact,
all intervals, whether of space or
of time, are reckoned among continuous
quantities only on account
of the quantity of continuous
movement which can be made,
or is actually made, in them, as we
have explained in a preceding article;
but the quantity of movement
is itself to be traced to the intensity
of the momentum produced
by the agent, and the momentum
to the intensity of the motive power.
As soon as movement is communicated
to a point, its ubication
begins to shift and to extend a
continuous line in space; and its
<em>now</em>, too, for the same reason begins
to flow and to extend continuous
time.</p>

<p>When the quantity of power is
expressed by a number, its value is
determined, as we have stated, by
the intensity of its efficiency in a
given time and fixed conditions.
The unit of intensity by which the
amount of the effect produced is
measured is arbitrary; for there is
no natural unit for the degrees of
intensity, it being evident that such
degrees can be divided and subdivided
without end, just like the
continuum. Hence the numbers
by which we express degrees of intensity
are only virtually discrete,
just as those by which we express
continuous quantities. The ordinary
unit assumed for the measure
of intensity is that degree of intensity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
which causes a unit of weight
to measure a unit of distance in a
unit of time. As all these units
are arbitrary, it is evident that such
is also the unit of intensity.</p>

<p>Let us remark, also, that the power
of natural causes has in its action
a twofold continuity&mdash;that is,
with regard both to space and to
duration. As long as a natural
cause exists, it acts without interruption,
owing to its intrinsic determination,
provided there be, as
there is always in fact, some subject
capable of being acted upon
by it. This constitutes the continuity
of action with regard to duration.
On the other hand, the motive
power of such natural causes
is exerted, according to the Newtonian
law, throughout an indefinite
sphere, as we have shown in another
place;<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> and this constitutes
the continuity of action through
space. Moreover, if the point acted
upon approaches the agent or
recedes from it, the continuous
change of distance will be accompanied
by a continuous change of
action; and thus the intensity of
the act produced by the agent will
increase or decrease in a continuous
manner through infinitesimal
degrees corresponding to the infinitesimal
changes of local relations
occurring in infinitesimal instants
of time. This relation of changes
is the base of dynamics. But
enough on this point.</p>

<p><i>Origin of movement.</i>&mdash;We may
now pass to the conclusions concerning
movement as dependent on
its proximate cause. The power
by which the natural causes produce
momentums of movement is
called “motive power.” This power
is to be found both in material
and in spiritual beings; but as in
spiritual substances the exercise of
the motive power is subject to their
will, and consists in the application
of a nobler power to the production
of a lower effect, we do not and
cannot consider the power of spiritual
beings as merely “motive,” for
it is, above all, intellective and volitive.
Material things, on the contrary,
because they possess no other
power than that of moving, are
characterized by it, and are naturally
determined to exercise it according
to a law which they cannot
elude. It is of these beings in particular
that the following conclusions
are to be understood.</p>

<p>1st. There is in all material
creatures a motive power&mdash;that is, a
first act of moving&mdash;which, considered
in its absolute state, has no need
of extrinsic termination, that is, of
producing a momentum of movement.</p>

<p>2d. This motive power is an objective
reality.</p>

<p>3d. The same power is nothing
accidentally superadded to the being
of which it is the power.</p>

<p>4th. This power is the virtuality,
or extrinsic terminability, of the
act by which the agent is.</p>

<p>5th. This power is not modified
by the production of momentums in
extrinsic terms.</p>

<p>6th. The momentums thus produced
are second acts of the motive
power, extrinsic to it; and though,
owing to their intensity, which may
be greater or less, they can be related
to one another through an intrinsic
foundation, yet their entitative
distances have only an extrinsic
foundation&mdash;to wit, the agent’s
power.</p>

<p>Some of these propositions are
quite evident; but our present object
is not only to explain what
may require a special discussion,
but also, and principally, to dissect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
our subject in such a manner as to
make it manifest that a perpetual
analogy exists between the conditions
and the principles of all kinds
of continuum, and that in all of
them the transition from the absolute
to the relative, from the cause
to the effect, and from the formal
reason to its formal result, is made
through a like process and through
similar degrees. For this reason
we think that even those conclusions
which seem too obvious to
deserve mention become interesting
and serve a good purpose; for
in the parallel treatment of analogous
subjects, those things which
are clearer throw light on those
which are more abstruse, and about
which we often feel a certain hesitation.</p>

<p>The first of our present conclusions
needs only a short explanation.
When we say that in every
creature there is a motive power
which, <em>considered in its absolute state</em>,
has no need of producing a momentum,
we mean that in every creature
there is an act which is a principle
of activity, but that the exercise
of this activity is not required
for the substantial perfection and
essential constitution of the creature
itself, though it may be required
for some other reason, as we
shall see presently. In fact, every
substance has its own complete being
independently of accidents; and
since the exertion of motive power
is an accident, every substance is
entitatively independent of it. We
conceive that if God had created
nothing but an element of matter,
such an element would indeed (on
its own part) be ready to act and
to produce a momentum of movement;
but, as there would be no
subject capable of receiving a momentum,
the motive power would
remain <i lang="la">in actu primo</i>&mdash;that is, without
actual exertion. And yet it is
evident that the non-existence of
other elements can have no bearing
on the intrinsic constitution and
substantial perfection of the element
in the question. Therefore
the power of an element of matter
is a first act, which, as far as the
entity of the element itself is concerned,
has no need of producing
any second act.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, since all creatures
must in some manner glorify God
as long as they exist, because such
is the true and highest end of
their existence, hence to every created
power some proportionate term
or subject corresponds, in which
its exertion is received without interruption.
In the same manner
as the understanding never lacks an
intelligible object, and the sense
never lacks a sensible term, about
which to exercise itself by immanent
operation, the motive power
of inferior beings never fails to
meet a proportionate&mdash;that is, movable&mdash;term
and to impress upon it
a momentum of a certain intensity.
Hence, when we regard, not the
substance of natural things as such,
but the natural necessity they are
under of tending constantly to the
ultimate end of their creation, we
see that their first act of moving
must always entail some second
act, or momentum, in all the terms
which it can reach according to its
natural determination.</p>

<p>The second conclusion is self-evident;
for, if the principle of real
movement were not an objective
reality, a real effect would proceed
from an unreal cause&mdash;which is
absurd. Nor does it matter that
the power is only a “first” act.
For, as we have explained above,
it is first as compared with the acts
which it can produce, but it is intrinsically
complete in the entity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
of the agent, as it is terminated to
its substantial term.</p>

<p>The third conclusion is nothing
but a corollary of the well-known
axiom that in all things the principle
of operation is the substantial
act: <i lang="la">Forma est id quo agens agit</i>,
and <i lang="la">Principium essendi est principium
operandi</i>. We have proved in another
place<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> that no natural accident
possesses active power or is
actually concerned in any of the effects
produced by the agent. This
truth should be well understood by
the modern scientists who very commonly
mistake the conditions of
the action for the active principle.
Of course no creature can act independently
of accidental conditions;
but these conditions have
no bearing on the active power
itself&mdash;they only determine (formally
and not efficiently) the mode
of its application according to a
constant law. Thus the distance
of two material points has no <em>active</em>
influence on their motive power or
on their mutual action, but only
constitutes the two points in a certain
relation to one another; and
when such a relation is altered, the
action is changed, not because the
power is modified, but because its
determination to act&mdash;that is, its
very nature&mdash;demands that it should
in its application follow the Newtonian
law of the inverse ratio of
the squared distances.</p>

<p>The philosophers of the old
school admitted, but never proved,
that, although the substantial form
is the main principle of activity in
natural things, nevertheless this
principle was in need of some
accidental entity, that it might be
proximately disposed to produce
its act. This opinion, too, originated
in the confusion of active
power with the conditions on
which the mode of its exertion depends.
What they called “active
qualities” is now acknowledged to
be, not a new kind of active power
superadded to the substantial
forms, but merely a result of
the concurrence of many simple
powers acting under determinate
conditions. The accidental
change of the conditions entails
the change of the result and
action, but the active powers evidently
remain the same. The
ancients said also that the substantial
forms were the active principles
of substantial generations,
whereas the “active qualities”
were the active principles of mere
alterations. As we have shown
that the whole theory of substantial
generations, as understood by
the peripatetic school, is based on
assumption and equivocation, and
leads to impossibilities,<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> we may be
dispensed from giving a new refutation
of the opinion last mentioned.</p>

<p>Our fourth conclusion directly
follows from the general principle
that the act by which a thing has
its first being is its principle of
action: <i lang="la">Quo aliquid primo est, eo
agit</i>. The substantial act, considered
as to its absolute entity, does not
connote action, but simply constitutes
the being of which it is the
act. In order to conceive it as an
active power, we must refer to the
effects which it virtually contains&mdash;that
is, we must consider its virtuality.
In this manner what is a
second act with regard to the substance
of the agent, will be conceived
as a first act with reference to the
effects it can produce, according to
a received axiom: <i lang="la">Actus secundus
essendi est actus primus operandi</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span></p>

<p>The fifth conclusion, notwithstanding
the contrary opinion of
many philosophers, is quite certain.
For all intrinsic modification is the
result of passive reception or passion.
Now, to produce a momentum
of movement is action,
not passion. Therefore, when such
a momentum is produced, no other
subject is intrinsically modified by
it except the one which passively
receives it. It is therefore the
being which is acted on, not that
which acts, that acquires an intrinsic
modification. The power
of the agent is not entitatively
and intrinsically more actuated by
action than by non-action. Its
action is an extrinsic termination,
and gives it nothing but the real denomination
of agent, by which it is
really related to the term acted on.
The patient, by its reception of
the momentum, becomes similarly
related to the agent, as is evident.
And the relation consists in this:
that the patient acquires formally
an act which the agent virtually
contains. This relation is of accidental
causality on the one side
and of accidental dependence on
the other. The foundation of the
relation is the accidental action as
coming from the one and terminating
in the other.</p>

<p>As everything that is in movement
must have received the motion
from a distinct agent, according
to the principle <i lang="la">Omne quod movetur,
ab alio movetur</i>, it follows that whatever
is in movement is accidentally
dependent on an extrinsic mover;
and, since all material elements are
both movers and moved, they all
have a mutual accidental causality
and dependence.</p>

<p>Our sixth conclusion is sufficiently
clear from what has been
said concerning the sixth conclusion
of the preceding series. The
momentum of movement is evidently
the second act of the motive
power&mdash;that is, the extrinsic term
of its exertion. The entitative distance
between two momentums produced
by the same mover is an
extrinsic relation; for its foundation
is the virtuality of the act by
which the agent is, as has been explained
above. But the same momentums,
as possessing greater or
less intensity, can also be compared
with one another according to their
intrinsic entity or degree; and thus
they will be found to have a mutual
relation arising from an intrinsic
foundation.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;As the ubication, so
also the momentum produced by
accidental action, can be considered
both absolutely and respectively.
The momentum, considered
absolutely, is an act received in a
subject&mdash;an absolute momentum,
an extrinsic term of the virtuality
of the motive principle; and, as
such a momentum is only one out
of the innumerable acts which can
proceed from the agent, it has an
entity infinitely less than that of
the agent. It is evident, in fact,
that between a substantial and an
accidental act there must be an infinite
entitative disproportion, both
because no substance can be substantially
changed by its accidents,
and because the substantial act
can never be exhausted, and not
even weakened, by the production
of accidental acts, as we have established
in another place.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> The
momentum is considered respectively
when it is compared with
another momentum, in which case
we can find the relation of the
one to the other as to intensity. This
intensity is measured by the
quantity of the movement to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
they give rise when not counteracted.</p>

<p>The unit of intensity is arbitrary
in the momentums, as in their principles,
for the same reason&mdash;that is,
because in neither case a natural
unit of intensity can be found. The
number expressing the relative intensity
of a momentum is only
virtually discrete, because the
momentum is only virtually compounded,
since it is not a number
of distinct acts, but one act equivalent
to many.</p>

<p><i>Movement and its affections.</i>&mdash;The
production of a momentum entails
movement. The general definition
of movement, according to Aristotle
and S. Thomas, is <i lang="la">Actus existentis
in potentia ut in potentia</i>, or,
as we would say, an actual passage
from one potential state to
another. Now, all created being is
potential in two manners: first, on
account of its passive receptivity;
secondly, on account of its affectibility,
which is a consequence of
its passivity, as we have explained
in the “Principles of Real Being.”<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
Hence the momentum of movement,
inasmuch as it is received
in the patient, actuates its passive
potency; and inasmuch as its reception
entails a certain mode of
being, it affects its resultant potentiality.
But besides this double
potentiality, which is intrinsic to
the subject, there is another potentiality
which refers to an extrinsic
term, and for this reason
movement is considered both as it
is a modification of its subject,
<i lang="la">ratione subjecti</i>, and as it points at
an extrinsic term, <i lang="la">ratione termini</i>.</p>

<p>With regard to its subject, movement
is usually divided into <em>immanent</em>
and <em>transient</em>. It is called
immanent when it results from immanent
acts, as when the soul
directs its attention to such or
such an object of thought; and it
is called transient when it brings
about a change in a subject distinct
from the agent, as when a man
moves a stone, or when the sun
moves the earth. But this is inaccurate
language; for what is
transient in these cases is the
<em>action</em>, not the <em>movement</em>.</p>

<p>With regard to its term, movement
is divided into two kinds&mdash;that
is, movement to a place, <i lang="la">motus
ad ubi</i>, and movement towards a
certain degree of perfection or intensity
of power, <i lang="la">motus virtutis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
The first is called <em>local</em> movement,
of which we will speak presently.
The second is subdivided into <em>intension</em>,
<em>remission</em>, and <em>alteration</em>.
Intension and remission are the acquisition
or loss of some degree of
perfection or of intensity with regard
to power and qualities; alteration
is the passage from one kind
of quality or property to another.
Thus, in water, heat is subject to
intension and remission; but when
the cohesive force of the molecules
is superseded by the expansive
force of vapor, there is alteration.</p>

<p>It is important to notice that
there is no <i lang="la">motus virtutis</i> in primitive
elements of matter. The exertion
of their power varies indeed
according to the Newtonian law,
but the power itself is always exactly
the same, as its principle is the
substantial act, which cannot be
modified by accidental action. It
is only in material compounds that
the <i lang="la">motus virtutis</i> can be admitted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
for the reason that the active
powers and qualities in them are a
result of composition; hence a
change in the mode of the composition
brings about a change in the
resultant. So also in spiritual substances
there is no <i lang="la">motus virtutis</i>,
because their active faculties are
always substantially the same. True
it is that the intellect has also its
passivity with regard to intelligible
species, and that it acts by so much
the more easily and perfectly in
proportion as it is better furnished
with intelligible species distinctly
expressed and arranged according
to their logical and objective connection.
But this cannot mean
that the active power of the intellect
can be increased, but only that
it can be placed in more suitable
conditions for its operations. And
the like is to be said of all acquired
habits; for they give a greater facility
of acting, not by intensifying
the intrinsic power, but by placing
the active faculty in such conditions
as are more favorable for its
operation.</p>

<p>But let us revert to local movement.
This movement may be defined
as <em>the act of gliding through
successive ubications</em>. Such a gliding
alters the relations of one body
to another, as is evident, but it involves
no new intrinsic modification
of the subject. As long as the
subject continues to move under
the same momentum, its intrinsic
mode of being remains uniformly
the same, while its extrinsic relations
to other bodies are in continual
change. Hence the local
movement of any point of matter
merely consists in the act of extending
from ubication to ubication,
or, as we may say, in <em>the evolution
of the intensity of the momentum
into continuous extension</em>. The reason
of this evolution is that the
momentum impressed on a subject
has not only a definite intensity,
but also a definite direction in
space; whence it follows that the
subject which receives the momentum
receives a determination to
describe a line in a definite direction,
which it must follow, owing to
its inertia, with an impetus equal to
the intensity of the momentum itself.
And in this manner a material
point, by the successive flowing
of its ubication, describes a line in
space, or evolves the intensity of
its momentum into extension.</p>

<p>Hence, of local movement we can
predicate both <em>intensity</em> and <em>extension</em>.
The intensity is the formal
principle, which, by actuating the
inertia or mobility of the subject,
evolves itself into extension. The
extension is the actual evolution of
the momentum, and constitutes the
essence of local movement, which
is always <i lang="la">in fieri</i>. And this is what
is especially pointed out in Aristotle’s
words: <i lang="la">Motus est actus existentis
in potentia, ut in potentia</i>.
The <i lang="la">actus</i> refers to the intensity,
which is not <i lang="la">in fieri</i>, but has a
definite actuality; whilst the <i lang="la">in potentia
ut in potentia</i> clearly refers to
the evolution of extension, which
is continually <i lang="la">in fieri</i> under the influx
of said act. Accordingly, local
movement is both intensive and
extensive. But this last epithet is
to be looked upon as equivalent to
“extending,” not to “extended”;
for it is the line drawn, or the track
of the movement already made,
that is properly “extended,” whereas
the movement itself is the act of
extending it.</p>

<p>The formal intensity of local
movement is called <em>velocity</em>. We
say the <em>formal</em> intensity, because
movement has also a <em>material</em> intensity.
The formal intensity regards
the rate of movement of each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
element of matter taken by itself,
and it is greater or less according
as it evolves a greater or a less extension
in equal times. The material
intensity regards the quantity
of matter which is moving with a
given velocity, and is measured by
the product of the velocity into the
mass of the moving body. This
product is called the momentum
of the body, or its quantity of movement.</p>

<p>Local movement is subject to
three affections&mdash;viz., <em>intension</em>, <em>remission</em>,
and <em>inflexion</em>. In fact, since
local movement consists in extending
with a certain velocity in a certain
direction, it is susceptible of being
modified either by a change of velocity,
which will intensify or weaken it,
or by a change of direction&mdash;that is,
by inflexion. So long, however, as
no agent disturbs the actual movement
already imparted to a body,
the movement must necessarily continue
in the same direction and
with the same velocity; for matter,
owing to its inertia, cannot modify
its own state. This amounts to
saying that the tendency uniformly
to preserve its rate and its direction
is not an accidental affection,
but the very nature, of local movement.</p>

<p>This being premised, we are going
to establish a series of conclusions,
concerning movement and
its affections, parallel to that which
we have developed in the preceding
pages respecting power and its
exertions. The reader will see
that the chain of our analogies
must here end; for, since movement
is not action, it affects nothing
new, and produces no extrinsic
terms, but only entails changes of
local relations. On the other hand,
the affections of local movement
are not of a transient, but of an
immanent, character, and thus they
give rise to no new entity, but are
themselves identified with the movement
of which they are the modes.
Our conclusions are the following:</p>

<p>1st. There is in all local movement
something permanent&mdash;that is,
a general determination of a lasting
character, which has no need of
being individuated in one manner
more than in another.</p>

<p>2d. This constant determination
is an objective reality.</p>

<p>3d. This same determination is
nothing accidentally superadded
to local movement.</p>

<p>4th. This determination is the
virtuality of the momentum of
movement, or the act of evolving
extension in a definite direction.</p>

<p>5th. This determination is not intrinsically
modified by any accidental
modification of local movement.</p>

<p>6th. The affections of local
movement are intrinsic and intransitive
modes, which identify themselves
with the movement which
they modify.</p>

<p>The first of these conclusions is
briefly proved thus: whatever is a
subject of real modifications has
something permanent. Local movement
is a subject of real modifications.
Therefore, local movement
involves something permanent.</p>

<p>The second conclusion is self-evident.</p>

<p>The third conclusion, too, is evident.
For whatever is accidentally
superadded to a thing can be
accidentally taken away, and therefore
cannot belong to the thing
permanently and invariably. Hence
the constant and fixed determination
in question cannot be an accident
of local movement.</p>

<p>The fourth conclusion is a corollary
of the third. For nothing
is necessarily permanent in local
movement, except that which constitutes
its essence. Now, its essence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
lies in this: that it must
evolve extension at the rate and
in the direction determined by the
momentum of which it is the exponent.
Therefore the permanent
determination of which we are
speaking is nothing else than the
virtuality of the momentum itself
as developing into extension. And
since the momentum by which the
moving body is animated has a
determinate intensity and direction,
which virtually contains a determinate
velocity and direction of
movement, it follows that the permanent
determination in question
consists in the actual tendency of
movement to evolve uniformly and
in a straight line&mdash;<em>uniformly</em>, because
velocity is the form of movement,
and the velocity determined
by the intensity of the actual momentum
is actually one; <em>in a
straight line</em>, because the actual
momentum being one, it gives but
one direction to the movement,
which therefore will be straight in
its tendency. Whence we conclude
that it is of the essence of local
movement to have <em>an actual tendency
to evolve uniformly in a straight
line</em>.</p>

<p>Some will object that local
movement may lack both uniformity
and straightness. This is quite
true, but it does not destroy our
conclusion. For, as movement is
always <i lang="la">in fieri</i>, and exists only by
infinitesimal instants in which it is
impossible to admit more than one
velocity and one direction, it remains
always true that within every
instant of its existence the movement
is straight and uniform, and
that in every such instant it tends
to continue in the same direction
and at the same rate&mdash;that is, with
the velocity and direction it actually
possesses. This velocity and direction
may, of course, be modified in
the following instant; but in the following
instant, too, the movement
will tend to evolve uniformly and in
a straight line suitably to its new
velocity and direction. Whence
it is manifest that, although in the
continuation of the movement there
may be a series of different velocities
and directions, yet the tendency
of the movement is, at every
instant of its existence, to extend
uniformly in a straight line. This
truth is the foundation of dynamics.</p>

<p>Our fifth conclusion is sufficiently
evident from what we have just
said. For, whatever be the intensity
and direction of the movement,
its determination to extend
uniformly in a straight line is not
interfered with.</p>

<p>Our last conclusion has no need
of explanation. For, since the affections
of local movement are the
result of new momentums impressed
on the subject it is plain that they
are intrinsic modes characterizing
a movement individually different
from the movement that preceded.
The tendency to evolve uniformly
in a straight line remains unimpaired,
as we have shown; but the
movement itself becomes entitatively&mdash;viz.,
quantitatively&mdash;different.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Local movement is
divided into <em>uniform</em> and <em>varied</em>.
Uniform movement we call that
which has a constant velocity.
For, as velocity is the form of
movement, to say that a movement
is uniform is to say that it has but
one velocity in the whole of its
extension. We usually call “uniform”
all movement whose apparent
velocity is constant; but, to
say the truth, no rigorously uniform
movement exists in nature
for any appreciable length of time.
In fact, every element of matter
lies within the sphere of action of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
all other elements, and is continually
acted on, and continually receives
new momentums; the evident
consequence of which is that its
real movement must undergo a
continuous change of velocity.
Hence rigorously uniform movement
is limited to infinitesimal
time.</p>

<p>Varied movement is that whose
rate is continually changing. It is
divided into <em>accelerated</em> and <em>retarded</em>;
and, when the acceleration or
the retardation arises from a constant
action which in equal times
imparts equal momentums, the movement
is said to be <em>uniformly</em> accelerated
or retarded.</p>

<p><i>Epilogue.</i>&mdash;The explanation we
have given of space, duration, and
movement suffices, if we are not
mistaken, to show what is the true
nature of the only continuous quantities
which can be found in the real
order of things. The reader will
have seen that the source of all continuity
is motive power and its exertion.
It is such an exertion that
engenders local movement, and
causes it to be continuous in its
entity, in its local extension, and in
its duration. In fact, why is the
local movement continuous <em>in its
entity</em>? Because the motive action
strengthens or weakens it by continuous
infinitesimal degrees in each
successive infinitesimal instant, thus
causing it to pass through all the
degrees of intensity designable between
its initial and its final velocity.
And again: why is the local
movement continuous <em>in its local
extension</em>? Because it is the property
of an action which proceeds
from a point in space and is terminated
to another point in space,
to give a local direction to the subject
in which the momentum is received;
whence it follows that the
subject under the influence of such
a momentum must draw a continuous
line in space. Finally, why is
the local movement continuous <em>in
its duration</em>? Because, owing to the
continuous change of its ubication,
the subject of the movement extends
its absolute <em>when</em> from <em>before</em>
to <em>after</em>, in a continuous succession,
which is nothing but the duration
of the movement.</p>

<p>Hence absolute space and absolute
duration, which are altogether
independent of motive actions, are
not <em>formally</em> continuous, but only
supply the extrinsic reason of the
possibility of formal continuums.
It is matter in movement that by
the flowing of its <i lang="la">ubi</i> from <em>here</em> to
<em>there</em> actually marks out a continuous
line in space, and by the flowing
of its <i lang="la">quando</i> from <em>before</em> to
<em>after</em> marks out a continuous line
in duration. Thus it is not absolute
space, but the line drawn in
space, that is <em>formally</em> extended
from <em>here</em> to <em>there</em>; and it is not absolute
duration, but the line successively
drawn in duration, that is
<em>formally</em> extended from <em>before</em> to
<em>after</em>.</p>

<p>With regard to the difficulties
which philosophers have raised at
different times against local movement
we have very little to say.
An ancient philosopher, when called
to answer some arguments against
the possibility of movement, thought
it sufficient to reply: <i lang="la">Solvitur ambulando</i>&mdash;“I
walk; therefore movement
is possible.” This answer
was excellent; but, while showing
the inanity of the objections, it
took no notice of the fallacies by
which they were supported. We
might follow the same course; for
the arguments advanced against
movement are by no means formidable.
Yet we will mention and
solve three of them before dismissing
the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<p><i>First.</i> If a body moves, it
moves where it is, not where it is
not. But it cannot move where it
is; for to move implies not to remain
where it is, and therefore
bodies cannot move. The answer
is, that bodies neither move where
they are nor where they are not,
but <em>from</em> the place where they are
<em>to</em> the place where they are not.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i> A material element cannot
describe a line in space between
two points without gliding
through all the intermediate ubications.
But the intermediate ubications
are infinite, as infinite points
can be designated in any line; and
the infinite cannot be passed over.
The answer is that an infinite multitude
cannot be measured by one
of its units; and for this reason
the infinite multitude of ubications
which may be designated between
the terms of a line cannot be
measured by a unit of the same
kind. Nevertheless, a line can be
measured by movement&mdash;that is,
not by the ubication itself, but <em>by
the flowing</em> of an ubication; because
the flowing of the ubication
is continuous, and involves continuous
quantity; and therefore it is
to be considered as containing in
itself its own measure, which is a
measure of length, and which may
serve to measure the whole line of
movement. If the length of a line
were an infinite sum of ubications&mdash;that
is, of mathematical points&mdash;the
objection would have some weight;
but the length of the line is evidently
not a sum of points. The
line is a continuous quantity
evolved by the flowing of a
point. It can therefore be measured
by the flowing of a point.
For as the line described can be
divided and subdivided without
end, so also the time employed in
describing it can be divided and
subdivided without end. Hence
the length of a line described in a
finite length of time can be conceived
as an infinite virtual multitude
of infinitesimal lengths, just in
the same manner as the time employed
in describing it can be conceived
as an infinite multitude of
infinitesimal instants. Now, the
infinite can measure the infinite;
and therefore it is manifest that an
infinite multitude of infinitesimal
lengths can be measured by the
flowing of a point through an infinite
multitude of infinitesimal instants.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p><i>Third.</i> The communication of
movement, as we know by experience,
requires time; and yet time
arises from movement, and cannot
begin before the movement is communicated.
How, then, will movement
be communicated? The
answer is that time and movement
begin together, and evolve
simultaneously in the very act of
the communication of movement.
It is not true, then, that all communication
of movement requires
time. Our experience regards only
the communication of <em>finite</em> movement,
which, of course, cannot be
made except the action of the agent
continue for a finite time. But
movement is always communicated
by infinitesimal degrees in infinitesimal
instants; and thus the beginning
of the motive action coincides
with the beginning of the
movement, and this coincides with
the beginning of its duration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span></p>

<p>And here we end. The considerations
which we have developed
in our articles on space,
duration, and movement have, we
think, a sufficient importance to
be regarded with interest by those
who have a philosophical turn of
mind. The subjects which we
have endeavored so far to investigate
are scarcely ever examined as
deeply as they deserve by the
modern writers of philosophical
treatises; but there is no doubt
that a clearer knowledge of those
subjects must enable us to extricate
ourselves from many difficulties
to be met in other parts
of metaphysics. It is principally
in order to solve the sophisms of
the idealists and of the transcendental
pantheists that we need an
exact, intellectual notion of space
and of time. We see how Kant,
the father of German idealism and
pantheism, was led into numerous
errors by his misconception of
these two points, and how his followers,
owing to a like hallucination,
succeeded in obscuring the
light of their noble intellects, and
were prompted to deny and revile
the most certain and fundamental
principles of human reasoning. In
fact, a mistaken notion of space
lies at the bottom of nearly all
their philosophical blunders. If we
desire to refute their false theories
by direct and categorical arguments,
we must know how far we
can trust the popular language on
space, and how we can correct
its inaccuracies so as to give precision
to our own phraseology, lest
by conceding or denying more
than truth demands we furnish
them with the means of retorting
against our argumentation. This
is the main reason that induced
us to treat of space, duration,
and movement in a special series
of articles, as we entertained the
hope that we might thus help
in cutting the ground from under
the feet of the pantheist by uprooting
the very germ of his manifold
errors.</p>

<h3>SONGS OF THE PEOPLE.</h3>

<p>Without going back to abstruse
speculations on the origin of music
in England (there is a mania in
our century for discovering the
“origin” of everything, and theorizing
on it, long before a sufficient
number of facts has been collected
even to make a pedestal for the
most modest and limited theory),
we gather from the mention of it
in old English poems, and books
on ballads and songs, glees and
catches, that it existed in a very
creditable form at least eight hundred
years ago. Indeed, there was
national and popular music before
this, and the Welsh songs, the
oldest of all, point far back to a
legendary past as the source of
their being. The first foreign song
that mingled with the rude music
of the early Britons was doubtless
that of the Christian missionaries
in the first century of our era, and
after that there can have been little
music among the converted Britons
but what was more or less tinged
with a foreign and Christian element.
We know, too, that at
various times foreign monks either
came or were invited to the different
kingdoms in England to
teach the natives the ecclesiastical
chant. Gardiner, in his <cite>Music of
Nature</cite>, says that “as the invaders
came from all parts of the Continent,
our language and music became a
motley collection of sounds and
words unlike that of any other
people; and though we have gained
a language of great force and extent,
yet we have lost our primitive
music, as not a single song remains
that has the character of being
national.” He also says that before
music was cultivated as an
art, England, in common with
other countries, had its national
songs, but that these, with the
people who sang them, were driven
by the conquerors into Ireland,
Scotland, and Wales. This assertion
is rather a sweeping one, and
the recognized formula about the
ancient inhabitants of Britain
being <em>all</em> crowded into certain
particular districts is one that will
bear modifying and correcting.
The British Anthropological Society
has, during the last ten
years, made interesting researches
in the field of race-characteristics
in different parts of England,
and an accumulation of facts has
gone far to prove the permanence
of some Gaelic, Cymric,
and Celtic types in other parts,
exclusive of Wales and Cornwall.
Dr. Beddoe and Mr. Mackintosh
have published the result
of their observations, and the latter
concludes that “a considerable
portion of the west Midland and
southwestern counties are scarcely
distinguishable from three of the
types found in Wales&mdash;namely, the
British, Gaelic, and Cymrian. In
Shropshire, and ramifying to the
east and southeast, the Cymrian
type may be found in great numbers,
though not predominating.…
In many parts of the southwest
the prevailing type among the
working classes is decidedly Gaelic.…
North Devon and Dorset
may be regarded as its headquarters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
in South Britain.” Then,
again, the district along the borders
of Wales, especially between Taunton
and Oswestry, and as far east
as Bath, shows a population more
naturally intellectual than that of
any other part of England, and
that without any superiority of
primary education to account for
it. The people are what might be
called Anglicized Welsh, and there
is among them a greater taste for
solid knowledge than in the heart of
England. Lancashire is to a great
extent Scandinavian, and also somewhat
Cymrian, as we have seen, and
there the people are known as a
shrewd, hardy race, thoughtful and
fond of study, and great adepts in
music.</p>

<p>At a large school in Tiverton,
Devonshire, nine-tenths of the boys
presented the most exaggerated
Gaelic physiognomy; while at another,
near Chichester, the girls
were all of the most unmistakable
Saxon type. We need not go further
in this classification, and only introduced
it to show that massing
together all British types in Wales
and Cornwall is a fallacy, such as
all hasty generalizations are. It is
not so certain, therefore, that there
exists no indigenous element in
the old songs that have survived,
though in many an altered form,
in some of the rural districts of
England. Then, again, how is the
word “national” used&mdash;in the
sense of indigenous, or of popular,
or of exclusively belonging
to one given country? English
music was, before the Commonwealth,
at least as indigenous as
the English language, as that
gradually grew up and welded
itself together. As to popularity,
there was a style of song&mdash;some
specimens of which we shall give&mdash;which
was known and used by
the poorest and humblest, and a
style, too, far removed from the
plebeian, though it may have been
rather sentimental. Then glees
and catches are, though of no very
great antiquity, essentially English,
and are scarcely known in any
other country. If “national”
stands for “political,” as many
people at this day seem to take
for granted, then, indeed, England
has not much to boast of. That
music is born rather of oppression
and defeat, and loves to commemorate
a people’s undying devotion
to their own race, laws, customs,
and rulers. Irish and Welsh and
Jacobite songs exhibit that style
best, though only the first of
the three have any present significance,
the two other kinds having
long ago become more valuable
for their intrinsic or historical
merit than for their political
meaning. Certain modern
English songs, such as “Ye Mariners
of England,” “Rule Britannia,”
“The Death of Nelson,”
might be called national songs in
the political sense; but “God Save
the King,” though patriotic and
loyal, is thoroughly German in
style and composition, and therefore
hardly deserves the title national.</p>

<p>The Welsh have kept their musical
taste pure. Mr. Mackintosh, in
his paper on the <cite>Comparative Anthropology
of England and Wales</cite>,
says of the quiet and thoughtful
villagers of Glan Ogwen, near the
great Penrhyn slate quarries, that
“their appreciation of the compositions
of Handel and other great
musicians is remarkable; and they
perform the most difficult oratorios
with a precision of time and intonation
unknown in any part of
England, except the West Riding
of Yorkshire, Lancashire, Worcester,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
Gloucester, and Hereford.”
The three latter are towns where
the musical festivals are so frequent
that the taste of the people
cannot help being educated up to
a good standard. Hereford, too, is
very near the Welsh border. “The
musical ear of the Welsh is extremely
accurate. I was once present
in a village church belonging
to the late Dean of Bangor, when
the choir sang an anthem composed
by their leader, and repeated
an unaccompanied hymn-tune
five or six times without the slightest
lowering of pitch. The works
of Handel, Haydn, Beethoven,
and Mozart are republished with
Welsh words at Ruthin and several
other towns, and their circulation
is almost incredible. At book and
music shops of a rank where in
England negro melodies would
form the staple compositions,
Handel is the great favorite; and
such tunes as ‘Pop goes the Weasel’
would not be tolerated. The
native airs are in general very elegant
and melodious. Some of
them, composed long before Handel,
are in the Handelian style;
others are remarkably similar to
some of Corelli’s compositions.
The less classical Welsh airs, in 3-8
time, such as ‘Jenny Jones’ are
well known. Those in 2-4 time
are often characterized by a sudden
stop in the middle or at the
close of a measure, and a repetition
of pathetic slides or slurs.”</p>

<p>Much of this eulogium might be
equally applied to the people of
Lancashire, especially the men,
who know the great oratorios by
heart, and sing the choruses faultlessly
among themselves, not only
at large gatherings, but in casual
reunions, whenever three or four
happen to meet. Their part-singing,
too, in glees, both ancient and
modern, is admirable, and they
have scarcely any taste for the low
songs which are only too popular
in many parts of England.</p>

<p>The songs of chivalry were another
graft on the stock of English
music, and the honor paid to the
bards and minstrels was a mingling
of the love of a national institution
at least as old as the Druids&mdash;some
say much older&mdash;and of
the enthusiasm produced by the
metrical relation of heroic feats of
arms. The Crusades gave a great
impulse to the troubadours’ songs,
while the ancient British custom
of commemorating the national
history by the oral tradition and
the music of the harpers, seemed
to merge into and strengthen
the new order of minstrels. Long
before the bagpipe became the
peculiar&mdash;almost national&mdash;instrument
of Scotland, the harp held
that position, as it has not yet
ceased to do, in Ireland and Wales.
The oldest harp now in Great Britain
is an Irish one, which was already
old in 1064. It is now in
the museum of Trinity College,
Dublin. These ancient instruments
were very different from
the modern ones on which our
grandmothers used to display their
skill before the pianoforte became,
to its detriment, the fashionable instrument
for young ladies; and even
now the Irish and Welsh harps are
made exactly on the old models,
and have no pedals. But the use
of the harp was not confined to
the Welsh, and in the reign of
King John, in the XIIth century,
on the occasion of an attack made
on the old town of Chester by the
Welsh during the great yearly fair,
it is recorded in the town annals
that the commandant assembled
all the minstrels who had come to
the place upon that occasion, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
marched them in the night, with
their instruments playing, against
the enemy, who, upon hearing so
vast a sound, were filled with such
terror and surprise that they instantly
fled. In memory of this
famous exploit, no doubt suggested
by the Biblical narrative of Gideon’s
successful stratagem, a meeting
of minstrels is annually kept
up to this day, with one of the
Dutton family at their head, to
whom certain privileges are granted.
In the reign of Henry I. the minstrels
were formed into corporate
bodies, and enjoyed certain immunities
in various parts of the kingdom.
Gardiner<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> says that “the
most accomplished became the
companions and favorites of kings,
and attended the court in all its expeditions.”
Perhaps we may refer
the still extant office of poet-laureate
to this custom of retaining a
court minstrel near the person of
the sovereign. In the time of
Elizabeth the profession of a harper
had become a degraded one,
only embraced by idle, low, and
dissolute characters; and so it has
remained ever since, through the
various stages of ballad-monger,
street-singer and fiddler, in which
the memory of the once noble office
has been merged or lost. In Scotland
the piper, a personage of importance,
has taken the place of
the harper since the time of Mary,
Queen of Scots, who introduced
the pipes from France; but in
Wales the minstrel, with his harp,
upheld his respectability much longer,
and even now most of the old
families, jealous and proud of their
national customs, retain their bard
as an officer of the household.
The writer has seen and heard one
of these ancient minstrels, in the
service of a family living near Llanarth,
the mistress (a widow) making
it her special business to promote
the keeping up of all old national
customs. She was an excellent
farmer, too, and had a pet breed
of small black Welsh sheep, whose
wool she prepared for the loom herself,
and with which she clothed
her family and household. In the
neighboring town she had got up
an annual competition of harpers
and choirs for the performance
of Welsh music exclusively. The
concert was always the occasion of a
regular country festivity, ending with
a ball, and medals and other prizes
were given by her own hand to the
best instrumental and vocal artists.</p>

<p>In Percy’s <cite>Reliques</cite> a description
is given of the dress and appearance
of a mediæval bard, as personated
at a pageant given at Kenilworth
in honor of Queen Elizabeth.
The glory of the brotherhood was
already so much a thing of the past
that it was thought worth while to
introduce this figure into a mock
procession. This very circumstance
is enough to mark the decline of
the art in those days, but already
a new sort of popular song had
sprung up to replace the romances
of chivalry. “A person,” says
Percy, “very meet for the purpose,
… his cap off; his head seemly
rounded tonsure-wise, fair-kembed
[combed], that with a sponge daintily
dipt in a little capon’s grease
was finely smoothed, to make it
shine like a mallard’s wing. His
beard smugly shaven; and yet his
shirt, after the new trink, with ruffs
fair starched, sleeked and glittering
like a pair of new shoes; marshalled
in good order with a setting stick
and strut, that every ruff stood up
like a wafer.<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> A long gown of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
Kendal-green gathered at the neck
with a narrow gorget, fastened
afore with a white clasp and a
keeper close up to the chin, but
easily, for heat, to undo when he
list. Seemly begirt in a red caddis
girdle; from that a pair of capped
Sheffield knives hanging at two
sides. Out of his bosom was drawn
forth a lappet of his napkin [handkerchief]
edged with a blue lace,
and marked with a true-love, a
heart, and <em>D</em> for Damain; for he
was but a bachelor yet. His gown
had long sleeves down to mid-leg,
lined with white cotton. His doublet-sleeves
of black worsted; upon
them a pair of poynets [wristlets,
from <i lang="fr">poignet</i>] of tawny chamlet,
laced along the wrist with blue
threaden points; a wealt towards
the hand of fustian-a-napes. A pair
of red neather stocks, a pair of
pumps [shoes] on his feet, with a
cross cut at the toes for corns; not
new, indeed, yet cleanly blackt with
soot, and shining as a shoeing-horn.
About his neck a red riband suitable
to his girdle. His harp in good
grace dependent before him. His
wrest [tuning-key] tyed to a green
lace, and hanging by. Under the
gorget of his gown, a fair chain of
silver as a squire minstrel of Middlesex,
that travelled the country
this summer season, unto fairs and
worshipful men’s houses. From
his chain hung a scutcheon, with
metal and color, resplendent upon
his breast, of the ancient arms of
Islington.” The peculiarities marking
his shoes no doubt referred to
the long pedestrian tours of the
early minstrels.</p>

<p>Chaucer, in the XIVth century,
makes frequent mention of music,
both vocal and instrumental. Of
his twenty-nine Canterbury Pilgrims,
six could either play or sing, and
two, the Squire and the Mendicant
Friar, could do both. Of the
Prioress he quaintly says:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Dr. Burney thinks that part-singing
was already known and practised
in Chaucer’s time, and draws
this inference from the notice the
poet takes in his “Dream” of the
singing of birds:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“… for some of them songe lowe</div>
<div class="verse">Some high, and all of one accorde”;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and it is certain that this kind of
music was a great favorite with the
English people at a very early
period, and was indebted to them
for many improvements. The same
writer says that the English, in
their secular music and in part-singing,
rather preceded than followed
the European nations, and
that, though he could find no music
in parts, except church music, in
foreign countries before the middle
of the XVIth century, yet in England
he found Masses in four, five,
and six parts, as well as secular
songs in the vulgar tongue in two
or three parts, in the XVth and
early part of the XVIth centuries.
Ritson, it is true, in his <cite>Ancient
Songs from the Time of King Henry
III. to the Revolution</cite>, disputes
this, but Hawkins is of the same
opinion as Burney. Mr. Stafford
Smith, at the end of the last century,
made a collection of old English
songs written in score for three
or four voices; but though the oldest
music to such songs is scarcely
intelligible, the number collected
proves how popular that sort of
music was in early times. (Perhaps
the illegibility of the music is
due to the old notation, in use before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
the perfected stave of four
lines became general&mdash;the pneumatic
notation, supposed by Coussemaker,
Schubiger, Ambros, and other
writers on music to have been developed
out of the system of accents
of speech represented by
signs, such as are still used in
French.)</p>

<p>Landini, an Italian writer of the
XVth century, in his <cite>Commentary on
Dante</cite>, speaks of “many most excellent
musicians” as coming from
England to Italy to hear and study
under Antonio <i lang="it">degli organi</i> (a name
denoting his profession); while another
writer, the choir-master of
the royal chapel of Ferdinand, King
of Naples, mentions the excellence
of the English vocal music in parts,
and even (incorrectly) calls John
of Dunstable (a musician of the
middle of the XVth century) the
“inventor of counterpoint.”</p>

<p>One of the oldest compositions
of this kind is a manuscript score
in the British Museum, a canon in
unison for four voices, with the addition
of two more voices for the
<em>pes</em>, as it is called, which is a kind
of ground, and is the basis of the
harmony. The words, partially
modernized, are as follows (they
are much older than the music,
which is only four hundred years
old):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Summer is a-coming in,</div>
<div class="verse">Loud sing cuckoo;</div>
<div class="verse">Groweth seed</div>
<div class="verse">And bloweth mead,</div>
<div class="verse">And springeth the weed new.</div>
<div class="verse">Ewe bleateth after lamb;</div>
<div class="verse">Loweth after calf, cow;</div>
<div class="verse">Bullock sterteth [leaps],</div>
<div class="verse">Buckè verteth [frequents green places],</div>
<div class="verse">Merry sing cuckoo;</div>
<div class="verse">Nor cease thou ever now.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Dr. Burney says of this song that
the modulation is monotonous, but
that the chief merit lies in “the
airy, pastoral correspondence of the
melody with the words”&mdash;a merit
which many modern compositions
of the “popular” type are very far
from possessing. Under the Tudors
music made rapid strides. Dr.
Robert Fairfax was well known as
a composer in those days, and a
collection of old English songs with
their music (often in parts), made
by him, has been preserved to this
day. Besides himself, such writers
as Cornyshe, Syr Thomas Phelyppes,
Davy, Brown, Banister, Tudor,
Turges, Sheryngham, and William
of Newark are represented. Of
these, Cornyshe was the best, and
Purcell, two hundred years later,
imitated much of his rondeau style,
most of these composers being entirely
secular. Henry VIII. himself
wrote music for two Masses,
and had them sung in his chapel;
and to be able to take a part in
madrigals, and sing at sight in any
piece of concerted music, was reckoned
a part of a gentleman’s education
in those days. The invention
of printing gave a great impulse
to song-writing and composing,
though for some time after the
words were printed the music was
probably still copied by hand over
the words; for the printing of notes
was of course a further and subsequent
development of the new art.
A musician and poet of the name
of Gray became a favorite of Henry
VIII. and of the Protector Somerset
“for making certain merry ballades,
whereof one chiefly was ‘The
hunt is up&mdash;the hunt is up.’”<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>“A popular species of harmony,”
says Ritson, “arose in this reign; it
was called ‘King Henry’s Mirth,’
or ‘Freemen’s Songs,’ that monarch
being a great admirer of vocal music.
‘Freemen’s Songs’ is a corruption
of ‘Three-men’s Songs,’ from
their being generally for three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
voices.” Very few songs were
written for one voice.</p>

<p>Ballads were very popular, and
formed one of the great attractions
at fairs. An old pamphlet, published
in the reign of Elizabeth, mentions
with astonishment that “Out-roaring
Dick and Wat Winbars”
got twenty shillings a day by singing
at Braintree Fair, in Essex. It
does seem a good deal, considering
that the sum was equal to five pounds
of the present money, which again
is equivalent to about thirty dollars
currency. These wandering
singers, the lowly successors of the
proud minstrels, were in their way
quite as successful; but, what is
more wonderful, their songs were
for the most part neither coarse
nor vulgar. Good poets wrote for
music in those days; <em>now</em>, as a
general rule, it is only rhymers who
avowedly write that their words
may be set to music. As quack-doctors,
fortune-tellers, pedlers,
etc., mounted benches and barrel-heads
to harangue the people, and
thus gained the now ill-sounding
name of mountebanks, so too did
these singers call over their songs and
sing those chosen by their audience;
and they are frequently called by
the writers of those times <i lang="it">cantabanchi</i>,
an Italian compound of <i lang="it">cantare</i>
(to sing) and <i lang="it">banchi</i> (benches).
Among the headings given of these
popular songs are the following:
“The Three Ravens: a dirge”;
“By a bank as I lay”; “So woe
is me, begone”; “Three merry
men we be”; “But now he is
dead and gone”; “Now, Robin,
lend me thy Bow”; “Bonny Lass
upon a green”; “He is dead and
gone, Lady,” etc. There is a quaint
grace and sadness about the titles
which speaks well for the manners
of those who listened and applauded.
Popular taste has certainly
degenerated in many parts of England;
for such titles <em>now</em> would
only provoke a sneer among an
average London or Midland county
audience of the lower classes.
Gardiner says: “The most ancient
of our English songs are of a grave
cast, and commonly written in the
key of G minor.”</p>

<p>Among the composers of the
reigns of Elizabeth and James I.
was Birde, who wrote a still popular
canon on the Latin words
“Non nobis, Domine,” and set to
music the celebrated song ascribed
to Sir Edward Dyer, a friend
of Sir Philip Sidney, “My Mind
to me a Kingdom is.”</p>

<p>Birde’s scholar, Morley, produced
a great number of canzonets,
or short songs for three or more
voices; and Ford, who was an
original genius, published some
pieces for four voices, with an accompaniment
for lutes and viols,
besides other pieces, especially
catches of an humorous character.
George Kirbye was another canzonet
composer, and Thomas Weelkes
has been immortalized by the good-fortune
which threw him in Shakspere’s
way, so that the latter often
wrote words for his music. Yet
doubtless the fame of the one, as
that of the other, was chiefly posthumous;
and poet and musician,
on a par in those days, may have
starved in company, unknowing
that a MS. of theirs would fetch
its weight in gold a hundred years
after they were in their graves.</p>

<p>“The musical reputation of
England,” says a writer in an old
review of 1834, “must mainly rest
on the songs in parts of the period
between 1560 and 1625.” And
Gardiner says: “If we can set up
any claim to originality, it is in
our glees and anthems.” The
gleemen, who were at first a class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
of the minstrels, are supposed to
have been the first who performed
vocal music in parts, according to
set rules and by notes, though the
custom must have existed long
before it was thus technically
sanctioned. The earliest pieces
of the kind <em>upon record</em> are by the
madrigal writers, and were, perhaps,
founded upon the taste of
the Italian school; but there soon
grew up a distinction sufficient
to mark English glee-music as a
separate species of the art. It is
said that glee-singing did not become
generally popular till about
the year 1770, when glees formed
a prominent part of the private
concerts of the nobility; but their
being adopted into fashionable
circles only at that date is scarcely
a proof of their late origin. The
canzonets for three or four voices
must have been closely allied to
glees, and a family likeness existed
between these and the madrigals
for four or five voices, the ballets,
or fa-las, for five, and the songs
for six and seven parts, which are
so prodigally mentioned in a list
of works by Morley within the short
space of only four years&mdash;1593 to
1597. The number of these songs
proves their wonderful popularity,
and we incline to think, with the
writer we have quoted, that the
English, in the catches and glees,
the works of the composers of the
days of Elizabeth and James I.,
and those of Purcell, Tallis, Croft,
Bull, Blow, Boyce, etc., at a later
period, possess a music essentially
national and original&mdash;not imitative,
as is the modern English
school, and not more indebted to
foreign sources than any other
progressive and liberal art is to
the lessons given it by its practisers
in other civilized communities.
For if <em>national</em> is to mean
isolated and petrified, by all means
let us forswear nationalism.</p>

<p>Shakspere’s songs are scattered
throughout his works, and were
evidently written for music. Both
old and new composers have set
them to music, and of the latter
none so happily as Bishop Weelkes
and John Dowland, his contemporaries
and friends; the latter, the
composer of Shakspere’s favorite
song (not his own), “Awake, sweet
Love,” often wrote music for his
words. In his plays Shakspere
has introduced many fragments of
<em>old</em> songs and ballads; but Ritson
says of him: “This admirable writer
composed the most beautiful
and excellent songs, which no one,
so far as we know, can be said to
have done before him, nor has any
one excelled him since.” This
statement is qualified by an exception
in favor of Marlowe, a predecessor
of Shakspere, and the author
of the “Passionate Shepherd
to his Love”; and besides, it means
that he was the first great poet
among the song-writers, who, in
comparison with him, might be called
mere ballad-mongers. Shakspere’s
love for the old, simple,
touching music of his native land,
shown on many occasions throughout
his works, is most exquisitely
expressed in the following passage
from <cite>Twelfth Night</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,</div>
<div class="verse">That old and antique song we had last night:</div>
<div class="verse">Methought it did relieve my passion much,</div>
<div class="verse">More than light airs and recollected terms</div>
<div class="verse">Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times.</div>
<div class="verse center">…</div>
<div class="verse">O fellow, come, the song we had last night.</div>
<div class="verse">Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain;</div>
<div class="verse">The spinsters and the knitters in the sun,</div>
<div class="verse">And the free maids that weave their thread with bones,<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></div>
<div class="verse">Do use to chant it; it is silly sooth,</div>
<div class="verse">And dallies with the innocence of love,</div>
<div class="verse">Like the old age.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Though Shakspere’s plays were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
marked with the coarseness of
speech common in his time, and
therefore not, as some have thought,
chargeable to him in particular, his
songs, on the contrary, are of singular
daintiness. They are too well
known to be quoted here, but they
breathe the very spirit of music,
being evidently intended to be sung
and popularly known. The chorus,
or rather refrain, of one, beginning,
“Blow, blow, thou winter wind,”
runs thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Heigh ho! sing heigh ho! unto the green holly;</div>
<div class="verse">Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.</div>
<div class="verse indent5">Then heigh ho! the holly!</div>
<div class="verse indent5">This life is most jolly!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The “Serenade to Sylvia” is lovely,
chaste and delicate in speech
as it is playful in form; and the
fairy song “Over hill, over dale,”
is like the song of a chorus of animated
flowers. The description
of the cowslips is very poetic:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The cowslips tall her pensioners be,</div>
<div class="verse">In their gold coats spots you see&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Those be rubies, fairy favors;</div>
<div class="verse">In those freckles live their savors.</div>
<div class="verse">I must go seek some dew-drops here,</div>
<div class="verse">And hang a pearl in every cowslip’s ear.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Bishop Hall, in 1597, published a
satirical poem in which he complains
that madrigals and ballads
were “sung to the wheel, and sung
unto the pail”&mdash;that is, by maids
spinning and milking, or fetching
water; and Lord Surrey, in one of
his poems, says (not satirically, however):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“My mother’s maids, when they do sit and spin,</div>
<div class="verse">They sing a song.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now, we gather what was the style
of these songs of peasant girls and
laborers from the writings of good
old Izaak Walton, who mentions, as
a common occurrence, that he often
met, in the fields bordering the
river Lee, a handsome milkmaid
who sang like a nightingale, her
voice being good and the ditties
fitted for it. “She sang the smooth
song which was made by Kit Marlowe,
now at least fifty years ago,
and the milkmaid’s mother sang
the answer to it which was made
by Sir Walter Raleigh in his younger
days.… They were old-fashioned
poetry, but choicely good; I
think much better than that now
in fashion in this critical age.”<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
He wrote in the reign of Charles
I., and already deplored the influx
of more pretentious songs; but
those he mentions with such commendation
were the famous “Passionate
Shepherd to his Love”
and the song beginning “If all the
world and love were young,” two
exquisite lyrics of an elegance
much above what is now termed
the taste of the vulgar.</p>

<p>Izaak Walton was as fond of
music as of angling, and quotes
many of the popular songs of his
day. He was a quiet man, and
only describes the pastimes of humble
life. He used to rest from his
labors in an “honest ale-house”
and a “cleanly room,” where he
and his fellow-fishermen, and sometimes
the milkmaid, whiled away
the evenings by singing ballads and
duets. Any casual dropper-in was
expected to take his part; and
among the music mentioned as common
in these gatherings are numbers
of “ketches,” or, as we should
say, catches. The music of one of
his favorite duets, “Man’s life is but
vain, for ’tis subject to pain,” is
given in the old editions of his
book. It is simple and pretty;
the composer was Mr. H. Lawes.
Other songs, favorites of his, were
“Come, shepherds, deck your
heads”; “As at noon Dulcina
rested”; “Phillida flouts me”; and
that touching elegy, “Sweet day,
so cool, so calm, so bright,” by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
George Herbert. This is as full of
meaning as it is short:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright,</div>
<div class="verse">The bridal of the earth and sky,</div>
<div class="verse">Sweet dews shall weep thy fall to-night</div>
<div class="verse indent4">For thou must die.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Sweet rose, whose hue, angry and brave,</div>
<div class="verse">Bids the rash gazer wipe his eye,</div>
<div class="verse">Thy root is ever in its grave,</div>
<div class="verse indent4">And thou must die.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Sweet spring, full of sweet days and roses,</div>
<div class="verse">A box where sweets compacted lie,</div>
<div class="verse">My music shows you have your closes</div>
<div class="verse indent4">And all must die.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Only a sweet and virtuous soul,</div>
<div class="verse">Like seasoned timber never gives,</div>
<div class="verse">But, when the whole world turns to coal,</div>
<div class="verse indent4">Then chiefly lives.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sir Henry Wotton’s song for the
poor countryman, beginning&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Fly from our country pastimes, fly,</div>
<div class="verse">Sad troops of human misery!</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Come, serene looks,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Clear as the crystal brooks,</div>
<div class="verse">Or the pure, azured heaven that smiles to see</div>
<div class="verse">The rich attendance on our poverty!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and some verses of Dr. Donne (both
these writers being contemporaries
of James I.), are also mentioned by
Walton as popular among the lower
classes in his day. Here is another
instance of the power of song over
the peasantry in the early part of
the XVIIth century. In the spring
of 1613, on the occasion of Queen
Anne of Denmark’s return from
Bath, where she had gone for her
health, she was met on Salisbury
Plain by the Rev. George Fereby,
vicar of some obscure country parish,
who entreated that her majesty
would be pleased to listen to a
concert performed by his people.
“When the queen signified her assent,
there rose out of the ravine
a handsome company, dressed as
Druids and as British shepherds
and shepherdesses, who sang a
greeting, beginning with these words,
to a melody which greatly pleased
the musical taste of her majesty:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“‘Shine, oh! shine, thou sacred star,</div>
<div class="verse">On seely<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> shepherd swains!’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We should suppose, from the commencing
words, that this poem had
originally been a Nativity hymn
pertaining to the ancient church;
and it is possible that the melody
might be traced to the same source.…
The music, the voices, and
the romantic dresses, so well corresponding
with the mysterious
spot where this pastoral concert
was stationed, greatly captivated
the imagination of the queen.”<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
Anne of Denmark admired and
patronized the genius of Ben Jonson,
the writer of several musical
masques often performed at court
by the queen and her noble attendants.
The really classical
time of English poetry and music
was before the Commonwealth,
and popular music certainly received
a blow during the Puritan
rule. Songs and ballads were forbidden
as profane; and in 1656
Cromwell enacted that “if any of
the persons commonly called fiddlers
or minstrels shall at any
time be taken playing, fiddling,
and making music in any inn, ale-house,
or tavern, or shall be taken
proffering themselves, or designing
or entreating any to hear them
play or make music in any of the
places aforesaid,” they should be
“adjudged and declared to be
rogues, vagabonds, and sturdy
beggars.” Fines and imprisonments
were often the penalties
attached to a disregard of these
ordinances; but this opposition
only turned the course of popular
song into political channels, and it
became a point of honor among
the Royalists to listen to, applaud,
and protect the veriest scamp who
called himself a minstrel. Songs
were written with no poetical merit,
but full of political allusions, bitter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
taunts and sneers; and it was the
delight of the Cavaliers to sing
these doggerel rhymes and make
the wandering fiddlers sing them.
Many a brawl owed its origin to
this. Even certain tunes, without
any words, were considered as
identified with political principle,
and led to dangerous ebullitions
of feeling, or kept alive party prejudices
in those who heard them.
Popular music has always been a
powerful engine for good or bad,
in a political sense. Half the
loyalty of the Jacobites of Scotland
in the XVIIIth century was
due to inflammatory songs; Körner’s
lyrics fired German patriotism
against Napoleon; and
there has never been a party of
any kind that did not speedily
adopt some representative melody
to fan the ardor of its adherents.</p>

<p>But if music and poetry were
proscribed by the over-rigorous
Puritans, a worse excess was fostered
by the immoral reign of
Charles II. The Restoration polluted
the stream which the Commonwealth
had attempted to dam
up. Just as, in a spirit of bravado
and contradiction, the Cavaliers
had ostentatiously made cursing
and swearing a badge of their
party, to spite the sanctimoniousness
of the Roundheads, so they
affected to oppose to the latter’s
psalm-singing roaring and immodest
songs. Ritson says that
Charles II. tried his hand at song-writing,
and quotes a piece by
him, beginning:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I pass all my hours in a shady old grove.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Though by no means remarkable
for poetical merit,” says the critic,
“it has certainly enough for the
composition of a king.” Molière
was not more severe on the
attempts of Louis XIV. But
though the general spirit of the
age was licentious, many good
songs were still written. Sedley,
Rochester, Dorset, Sheffield, and
others wrote unexceptionable ones,
and the great Dryden flourished
in this reign. One of his odes,
“On S. Cecilia’s Day,” is thoroughly
musical in its rhythm, the refrains
at the end of each stanza
having the ring of some of the old
German Minnesongs of the XIIth
and XIIIth centuries. But his
verses were scarcely simple or
flowing enough to become popular
in the widest sense, which honor
rather belonged to the less celebrated
poets of his day. Lord
Dorset, for instance, was the
author of a sea-song said to have
been written the night before an
engagement with the Dutch in
1665, and which, from its admirable
ease, flow, and tenderness, became
at once popular with all classes.
The circumstances under which
it was supposed to be written had,
no doubt, something to do with its
popularity; but Dr. Johnson says:
“Seldom any splendid story is
wholly true. I have heard from
the late Earl of Orrery, who was
likely to have good hereditary intelligence,
that Lord Dorset had been
a week employed upon it, and only
retouched or finished it on the
memorable evening. But even
this, whatever it may subtract from
his facility, leaves him his courage.”
The anonymous writer to whom we
have referred<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> tells us that “the
shorter pieces of most of the poets
of the time of Charles II. had a
rhythm and cadence particularly well
suited to music. They were, in
short, what the Italians call <i lang="it">cantabile</i>,
or fit to be sung.… In the
succeeding reigns, with the growth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
of our literature, there was a considerable
increase in song-writing;
most of our poets of eminence, and
some who had no eminence except
what they obtained in that way, devoting
themselves occasionally to
the composition of lyrical pieces.
Prior, Rowe, Steele, Philips, Parnell,
Gay, and others contributed
a stock which might advantageously
be referred to by the composers
of our own times.” Prior was a
friend and <i lang="fr">protégé</i> of Lord Dorset,
who sent him to Cambridge and
paid for his education there. Parnell
was an Irishman. His “Hymn
to Contentment” is a sort of counterpart
to the old song “My Mind
to me a Kingdom is”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Lovely, lasting peace, appear;</div>
<div class="verse">This world itself, if thou art here,</div>
<div class="verse">Is once again with Eden blest,</div>
<div class="verse">And man contains it in his breast.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Gay, the elegant, the humorous,
and the pathetic, shows to most advantage
in this group. He it was
who wrote the famous ballad “Black-eyed
Susan,” and many others
which, though less known at present,
are equally admirable. One
of them was afterwards set to music
by Handel, and later on by Jackson
of Exeter. But music did not keep
pace with poetry; and though Purcell,
Carey, and one or two other
composers flourished in the latter
part of the XVIIth and beginning
of the XVIIIth centuries, they kept
mostly to sacred music, and the
new songs of the day were generally
set to old tunes. Gay’s <cite>Beggar’s
Opera</cite>, a collection of seventy-two
songs, could not boast of a single
air composed for the purpose. The
music was all old, but the stage,
says Dr. Burney, ruined the simplicity
of the old airs, as it invariably
does all music adapted to dramatic
purposes. Indeed, we, in
our own day, sometimes have the
opportunity of verifying this fact,
when old airs or ballads are introduced
into operas to which they
are unfitted. The “Last Rose of
Summer” put into the opera of
<cite>Martha</cite> is an instance in point;
but, worse than that, the writer once
heard “Home, Sweet Home” sung
during the music-lesson scene in
the <cite>Barbier de Seville</cite>. Adelina
Patti was the <i lang="it">prima donna</i>, and any
one who has seen and heard her
can imagine the contrast between
the simple, pathetic air and words,
and the kittenish, coquettish, Dresden-china
style of the singer! Add
to this the costume of a Spanish
<i lang="es">señorita</i> and the stage finery of
Rosina’s boudoir, not to mention
the absurd anachronism involved
in a girl of the XVIIth century
singing Paine’s touching song. Of
course the audience applauded
vigorously; for an English audience
at the opera goes into action in the
spirit of Nelson’s words, “England
expects every man to do his duty,”
and the incongruousness of the
scene never troubles its mind.</p>

<p>Carey tried to stem the downfall
of really good popular music by
writing both the words and music
of the well-known ballad of “Sally
in our Alley,” which attained a
popularity (using the word in its
proper sense) that it has never lost
and never will lose. The song was
soon known from one end of the
country to the other, and, like the
old songs, was “whistled o’er the
furrowed land” and “sung to the
wheel, and sung unto the pail.”
Addison was no less fond of it
than the common people; but the
song was an exception in its time,
and the poetry of the day never
again made its way among the great
body of the people, as it had done
under the Tudors and the early
Stuarts. Music and poetry both grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
artificial under the Hanoverian dynasty,
and the mannerisms and affectations
of rhymers and would-be musical
critics were sharply satirized by
Pope and Swift. In the reign of
Queen Anne the Italian opera was
introduced into London, and the
silly rage for foreign music, <em>because</em>
it was foreign, soon worked its way
among all classes. Handel brought
about the first salutary return to
natural and simple musical expression,
and, setting many national and
pastoral pieces to music, diffused
the taste for good music through
the intermediate orders of the people,
especially the country gentry,
but the masses still clung to interminable
ballads, with monotonous
tunes and no individuality either
of sense or of form. Although England
could boast of some good native
composers and poets in the XVIIIth
century&mdash;for instance, among the former,
Boyce, Arne, Linley, Jackson,
Shield, Arnold, etc.&mdash;still no good
music penetrated into the lower
strata of society; for these musicians
mostly confined themselves to
pieces of greater pretension than
anything which was likely to become
popular. Wales and the
North of England still kept up a
better standard, but the general
taste of the nation was decidedly
vitiated. Dibdin’s sea-songs broke
the spell and reached the heart
of the people; but this was rather
a momentary flash than a permanent
resurrection of good taste and
discernment. The custom of writing
the majority of songs for one
voice, we think, had had much to
do with destroying the genuine love
of music among the people. It
seemed to shift the burden of entertainment
upon one member of a
social gathering, instead of assuming
that music was the welcome occupation
and pastime of the greater
number; and besides this, it no
doubt fostered an undue rage for
melody, or, as it is vulgarly called,
<em>tune</em>. We have often had occasion
to notice how bald and meagre&mdash;trivial,
indeed&mdash;a mere thread of
melody can sound when sung by
one voice, which, if sung in parts,
acquires a majestic and full tone.
The fashion of solo-singing, which
obtains so much in our day, has
another disadvantage: it encourages
affectation and self-complacency in
the singer. The solo-singer is very
apt to arrogate to him or herself
the merit and effect of the piece;
to think more of the individual performance
than of the music performed;
and to spoil a good piece
by interpolating runs and shakes to
show off his or her powers of vocal
gymnastics. All this was impossible
in the old part-songs, where
attention and precision were indispensable.</p>

<p>There are hopeful indications at
present that England is not utterly
sunk into musical indifference, but,
strange to say, wherever the good
leaven <em>does</em> work, it does so from
below upwards. The lower classes
in the North of England have mainly
given the impulse; the higher
are still, on the whole, superficial in
their tastes and trivial and mediocre
in their performances. Even
as far back as 1834, the writer in
the <cite>Penny Magazine</cite> already quoted
gives an interesting account of a
surprise he met with at a small village
in Sussex. (This, be it remembered,
is an almost exclusively
Saxon district of the country.)
Being tired of the solitude of the
little inn and the dulness of a
country newspaper, he walked down
the street of the village, and, in so
doing, was brought to a pause before
a small cottage, nowise distinguished
from the other humble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
homesteads of the place, from which
proceeded sounds of sweet music.
The performance within consisted,
not of voices, but of instruments;
and the piece was one of great
pathos and beauty, and not devoid
of musical difficulty. When it was
finished, and the performers had
rested a few seconds, they executed
a German quartet of some pretensions
in very good style. This
was followed by variations on a
popular air by Stephen Storace,
which they played in excellent
time and with considerable elegance
and expression. Several
other pieces, chosen with equal
good taste, succeeded this, and the
stranger enjoyed a musical treat
where he little expected one. On
making inquiries at the inn, he
found that the performers were all
young men of the village, humble
mechanics and agricultural laborers,
who, for some considerable
time, had been in the habit of
meeting at each other’s houses in
the evening, and playing and practising
together. The taste had
originated with a young man of
the place who had acquired a little
knowledge of music at Brighton.
He had taught some of his comrades,
and by degrees they had so
increased in number and improved
in the art that now, to use the
words of the informant, “there
were eight or ten that could play
by book and in public.”</p>

<p>At that time, and in that part of
the country, this was an unusual
and remarkable proof of refinement
and good taste; but at present,
though still the exception, it
is no longer quite so rare to find
uneducated people able to a certain
degree to appreciate good music.
Much has been written to vindicate
English musical taste within the
last thirty or forty years; but still
the fact can scarcely be overlooked
that, notwithstanding all efforts to
the contrary, the standard of taste
among the masses is lower than it
was in Tudor days.</p>

<p>Every one is familiar with the
choral unions, the glee-clubs, the
carol-singing, Leslie’s choir, and
Hullah’s methods, which all go far to
raise the taste of the people and enlist
the vocal powers of many who
otherwise would have been tempted
to leave singing to the “mounseers”
and other “furriners,” as the only
thing those benighted individuals
could be good for. There is, as
there has been for many generations,
the Chapel Royal, a sort of informal
school of music; there is the
Academy of Music; there are
“Crystal Palace” and “Monday
Popular Concerts”; musical festivals
every year in the various
cathedrals, oratorios in Exeter Hall;
and there soon will be a “National
School of Music,” which is to be a
climax in musical education, the
pride of the representative bodies
of wealthy and noble England (for
princes and corporations have vied
with each other in founding scholarships);
but with all this, the palmy
days of the Tudors are dead and
gone beyond the power of man to
galvanize them into new activity.
True, every young woman plays the
pianoforte; you see that instrument
in the grocer’s best parlor and the
farmer’s keeping-room; but the sort
of music played upon it is trivial
and foreign, an exotic in the life of
the performer, a boarding-school
accomplishment, not a labor of
love. You can hear “Beautiful
Star,” and “Home, Sweet Home,”
and Mozart’s “Agnus Dei” sung
one after the other, with the same
expression, the same “strumminess,”
the same stolidity, or the same affected
languor, and you will perceive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
that, though the singer may <em>know</em>
them, she neither feels nor understands
them. Moore’s melodies,
too, you hear <i lang="la">ad nauseam</i>, murdered
and slurred over anyhow; but both
the delicacy of the poetry and the
pathos of the music are a dead-letter
to the performer. But though
a few songs by good writers are
popular in the middle classes&mdash;for
instance, Tennyson’s “Brook” and
“Come into the garden, Maud,” the
immortal and almost unspoilable
“Home, Sweet Home”&mdash;yet there is
also a dark side to the picture in
the prevalence of comic songs, low,
slangy ballads, sham negro melodies
(utterly unlike the real old
pathetic plantation-song), and other
degrading entertainments classed
under the title of “popular music.”
The higher classes give little countenance
or aid to the upward movement
in music, and still look upon
the art as an adjunct of fashion.
With such disadvantages, it is a wonder
that England has struggled back
into the ranks of music-lovers at all,
even though, as yet, she can take but
a subordinate place among them.</p>

<h3>PIOUS PICTURES.</h3>

<p>A great deterioration having
been observable for some time past
in the multitudinous little pictures
published in Paris, ostensibly with
a religious object, some of the more
thoughtful writers in Catholic periodicals
have on several recent occasions
earnestly protested against
the form these representations are
taking. Their remonstrances are,
however, as yet unsuccessful. The
“article” continues to be produced
on an increasing scale, and is daily
transmitted in immense quantities,
not only to the farthest extremities
of the territory, but far beyond, especially
to England and America,
to ruin taste, sentimentalize piety,
and “give occasion to the enemy
to” <em>deride</em> if not to “blaspheme.”</p>

<p>The bishops of France have already
turned their attention to this
unhealthy state of things in what
may be called pictorial literature
for the pious, and efforts are being
made in the higher regions of
ecclesiastical authority to arrest its
deterioration. In the synod lately
held at Lyons severe censure was
passed on the objectionable treatment
of sacred things so much in
vogue in certain quarters; and, still
more recently, Father Matignon, in
his conference on “The Artist,” condemned
these “grotesque interpretations
of religious truths, which
render them ridiculous in the eyes
of unbelievers, and corrupt the
taste of the faithful.” The eloquent
preacher at the same time
recommended the Catholic journalists
to denounce a species of commerce
as ignorant as it is mercenary,
and counselled the members
of the priesthood to “declare unrelenting
war against this school of
<em>pettiness</em>, which is daily gaining
ground in France, and which gives
a trivial and vulgar aspect to things
the most sacred.”</p>

<p>This appeal has not been without
effect. There appears in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
<cite>Monde</cite>, from the pen of M. Léon
Gautier, the author of several pious
and learned works, a Letter
“Against Certain Pictures,” addressed
“to the president of the Conference
of T&mdash;&mdash;,” in which the absurdity
of these silly compositions
is attacked with much spirit and
good sense. The <cite>Semaine Religieuse
de Paris</cite> reproduces this letter,
with an entreaty to its readers
to enroll themselves in the crusade
therein preached by the eminent
writer&mdash;a crusade the opportuneness
of which must be only too evident
to every thoughtful and religious
mind. M. Léon Gautier writes
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>You have requested me, dear
friend, to purchase for you a
“gross” of little pictures for distribution
among your poor and
their children.…</p>

<p>As to the selection of these pictures
I must own myself greatly
perplexed, and must beg to submit
to you very humbly my difficulties,
and not only my difficulties, but
also my distress, and, to say the
truth, my indignation. I have before
my eyes at this moment four
or five hundred pictures which have
been sold to me as “pious,” but
which I consider as in reality among
the most detestable and irreverent
of any kind of merchandise. A
great political journal the other
day gave to one of its leaders the
title of <cite>L’Ecœurement</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> I cannot
give a title to my letter, but, were
it possible to do so, I should choose
this one in preference to any other.
I am in the unfortunate state of a
man who has swallowed several
kilograms of adulterated honey. I
am suffering from an indigestion of
sugar; and what sugar! Whilst in
the act of buying these little horrors,
I beheld numberless purchasers
succeed each other with feverish
eagerness in the shops, which I will
not specify. Yes, I had the pain
of meeting there with Christian
Brothers and with Sisters of Charity,
who made me sigh by their
simple avidity and ingenuous delight
at the sight of these frightful
little black or rose-colored prints.
They bought them by hundreds, by
thousands, by ten thousands; for
schools, for orphanages, for missions.
Ah! my dear friend, how
many souls are going to be well
treacled in our hapless world! It
is the triumph of confectionery.
“Why are you choosing such machines
as these?” I asked of the
good Brother Theodore, whom, to
my great astonishment, I found
among the purchasers; “they are
disagreeable.” “Agreed.” “They
are stupid.” “I know it.” “They
are dear.” “My purse is only too
well aware of the fact.” “Then
why do you buy them?” “Because
I find that these only are acceptable.”
And thereupon the
worthy man told me that he had
the other day distributed among
his children pictures taken from the
fine head of our Saviour attributed
to Morales&mdash;a <i lang="fr">chef-d’œuvre</i>. The
children, however, perceiving that
there was no gilding upon them,
had thrown them aside, gaping.
Decidedly, the evil is greater than
I had supposed, and it is time to
consider what is to be done.</p>

<p>In spite of all this, I have bought
your provision of pictures; but do
not be uneasy&mdash;I am keeping them
myself, and will proceed to describe
them to you. I do not wish that
the taste of your beloved poor
should be vitiated by the sight of
these mawkish designs; but I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
take upon myself to analyze them
for your benefit, and then see if
you are not very soon as indignant
as myself.</p>

<p>In the first place we have the
“symbolical” pictures, and these
are the most numerous of all. I
do not want to say too much
against them. You know in what
high estimation I hold true symbolism,
and we have many a time
exchanged our thoughts on this
admirable form of the activity
of the human mind. A symbol
is a comparison between things
belonging to the physical and
things belonging to the immaterial
world. Now, these two worlds
are in perfect harmony with
each other. To each phenomenon
of the moral order there corresponds
exactly a phenomenon of
the visible order. If we compare
these two facts with each other, we
have a symbol. There is a life, a
breath, a whiteness, which are
material. Figurative language is
nothing else than a vast and
wonderful symbolism, and you remember
the marvellous things written
on this subject by the lamented
M. Landriot. In the supernatural
order it is the same, and all Christian
generations have made use of
symbolism to express the most
sacred objects of their adoration.
There has been the symbolism of
the Catacombs; there has been
also that of the Middle Ages.
The two, although not resembling,
nevertheless complete, each other,
and eloquently attest the fact that
the Christian race has never been
without the use of symbols.</p>

<p>Thus it is not symbolism which I
condemn, but this particular symbolism
of which I am about to
speak, and which is so odiously
silly. I write to you with the
proofs before me. I am not inventing,
but, mirror-wise, merely reflecting.
I am not an author, but
a photographer.</p>

<p>Firstly, here we have a ladder,
which represents “the way of the
soul towards God.” This is very
well, although moderately ideal;
but then who is mounting this
ladder? You would never guess.
It is a dove! Yes; the poor bird
is painfully climbing up the rounds
as if she were a hen getting back
to roost, and apparently forgetting
that she owns a pair of wings.
But we shall find this dove elsewhere;
for our pictures are full of
the species, and are in fact a very
plentifully-stocked dove-cote. I
perceive down there another animal;
it is a roe with her fawn,
and with amazement I read this
legend: “The fecundity of the
breast of the roe is the image of
the abundance and sweetness of
grace.” Why was the roe selected,
and why roe’s milk? Strange! But
here again we have a singular collection.
On a heart crowned with
roses is placed a candlestick (a
candlestick on a heart!), and this
candelabrum, price twenty-nine
sous, is surmounted by a lighted
candle, around which angels are
pressing. This, we are told underneath,
is “good example.” Does it
mean that we are to set one for the
blessed angels to follow? Next,
what do I see here? A guitar;
and this at the foot of the cross.
Let us see what can be the reason
of this mysterious assemblage; the
text furnishes it: <i lang="fr">Je me délasserai
à l’abri de la Croix</i>&mdash;“I will refresh
myself in the shelter of the cross”&mdash;from
whence it follows that one
can play the guitar upon Golgotha.
Touching emblem! And what do
you say of this other, in which our
Saviour Jesus, the Word, and, as
Bossuet says, the Reason and Interior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
Discourse of the Eternal
Father, is represented as occupied
in killing I know not what little
insects on the leaves of a rose-bush?
“The divine Gardener
destroys the caterpillars which
make havoc in his garden,” says
the legend. I imagine nothing,
but merely transcribe, and for my
part would gladly turn insecticide
to this collection of <i lang="fr">imagerie</i>.</p>

<p>This hand issuing out of a cloud
I recognize as the hand of my
Lord God, the Creator and Father
of all, who is at the same time their
comforter, their stay, and their life.
I admit this symbol, which is ancient
and truly Christian; but this
divine hand, which the Middle
Ages would most carefully have
guarded against charging with any
kind of burden; this hand, which
represents Eternal Justice and Eternal
Goodness&mdash;can you imagine
what it is here made to hold?
[Not even the fiery bolt which the
heathen of old times represented
in the grasp of their Jupiter Tonans,
but] a horrible and stupid
little watering-pot, from the spout
of which trickles a driblet of water
upon the cup of a lily. Further on
I see the said watering-pot is replaced
by a sort of jug, which the
Eternal is emptying upon souls in
the shape of doves; and this, the
legend kindly informs me, is “the
heavenly dew.” Heavenly dew
trickling out of a jug! And
there are individuals who can imagine
and depict a thing like this
when the beneficent Creator daily
causes to descend from his beautiful
sky those milliards of little
pearly drops which sparkle in the
morning sunshine on the fair mantle
of our earth! Water, it must
be owned, is scarcely a successful
subject under any form with our
picture-factors. Here is a poor
and miserably-painted thread lifting
itself up above a basin, while I
am informed underneath that “the
jet of water is the image of the
soul lifting itself towards God by
meditation.”</p>

<p>I also need to be enlightened as
to how “a river turned aside from
its course is an image of the good
use and of the abuse of grace.”
It is obscure, but still it does not
vulgarize and debase a beautiful
and Scriptural image, like the next
I will mention, in which, over the
motto, “Care of the lamp: image
of the cultivation of grace in our
hearts,” we have a servant-maid
taking her great oily scissors and
cutting the wick, of which she scatters
the blackened fragments no matter
where.</p>

<p>The quantity of ribbon and
string used up by these symbol-manufacturers
is something incalculable.
Here lines of string
unite all the hearts of the faithful
(doves again!) to the heart of Our
Blessed Lady; there Mary herself,
the Immaculate One and our own
incomparable Mother, from the
height of heaven holds in leash,
by an interminable length of string,
a certain little dove, around the
neck of which there hangs a scapular.
This, we are told, means that
“Mary is the directress of the obedient
soul.” Elsewhere the string
is replaced by pretty rose-colored
or pale-blue ribbons, which have
doubtless a delicious effect to those
who can appreciate it. Here is a
young girl walking along cheerfully
enough, notwithstanding that her
heart is tied by one of these elegant
ribbons to that of the Blessed
Mother of God, apparently without
causing her the slightest inconvenience.
Her situation, however, is, I
think, less painful than that of this
other young person, who is occupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
in carving her own heart into
a shape resembling that of Mary.
Another young female has hoisted
this much-tormented organ (her
own) on an easel, and is painting
it after the same pattern. But let
us hasten out of this atelier to
breathe the open air among these
trees. Alas! we there find, under
the form and features of an effeminate
child of eight years old, “the
divine Gardener putting a prop to
a sapling tree,” or “grafting on the
wild stock the germ of good fruits.”
This is all pretty well; but what
can be said of this ciborium which
has been energetically stuck into a
lily, with the legend, “I seek a
pure heart”? These gentlemen, indeed,
treat you to the Most Holy
Eucharist with a free-and-easyness
that is by no means fitting or
reverent. It is forbidden to the
hands of laics to touch the Sacred
Vessels, and it is only just that the
same prohibition should apply to
picture-makers. They are entreated
not to handle thus lightly and
irreverently that which is the object
of our faith, our hope, and our love.</p>

<p>Hitherto I have refrained from
touching upon that very delicate
subject which it is nevertheless
necessary that I should approach&mdash;namely,
the representation of the
Sacred Heart. And here I feel
myself at ease, having beforehand
submitted to all the decisions of
the church, and having for long
past made it my great aim to be
penetrated with her spirit. Like
yourself, I have a real devotion to
the Sacred Heart, nor do I wish
to conceal it. When any devotion
takes so wide a development in the
Holy Church, it is because it is willed
by God, who watches unceasingly
over her destinies and the
forms of worship which she renders
to him. All Catholics are agreed
upon this point. It is true that
certain among them regard the Sacred
Heart as the symbol of Divine
Love, and that others consider it
under the aspect of a very adorable
part of the Body of the God-Man,
and, if I may so express it, as
a kind of centralized Eucharist.
Well, I hold that to be accurate
one ought to admit and harmonize
the two systems, and therefore I
do so. You are aware that it is
my belief that physiology does not
yet sufficiently understand the mechanism
of our material heart, and
I await discoveries on that subject
which shall establish the fact of its
necessity to our life. The other
day, at Baillère’s, I remained a long
time carefully examining a fine engraving
representing the circulation
of the blood through the veins
and arteries, and I especially contemplated
the heart the source and
receptacle of this double movement,
and said to myself, “The worship
of the Sacred Heart will be
one day justified by physiology.”
But why do I say this, when it is
so already? Behold me, then, on
my knees before the Sacred Heart
of my God, in which I behold at
the same time an admirable symbol
and a yet more admirable reality.
But is this a reason for representing
the Sacred Heart in a manner alike
ridiculous and odious? I will not
here enter upon the question as to
whether it is allowable to represent
the Sacred Heart of Jesus otherwise
than in his Sacred Breast, and
I only seek to know in order to accept
unhesitatingly whatever with
regard to this may be the thought
of the church. But that which to
my mind is utterly revolting is the
sight of the profanations of which
these fortieth-rate picture-manufacturers
are guilty. What right
have they, and how do they dare,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
to represent hundreds of consecrated
Hosts issuing from the Sacred
Heart, and a dove pecking at them
as they are dropping down? What
right have they to make the Heart
of our Lord God a pigeon-house,
a roosting-place for these everlasting
doves, or into a vase out of
which they are drinking? What
right have they to insert a little
heart (ours) into the Divine Heart
of Jesus? What right have they
to represent to us [a Pelion, Ossa,
and Olympus on a small scale]
three hearts, the one piled upon
the other, and cascades of blood
pouring from the topmost, which is
that of Our Lord; upon the second,
which is that of his Blessed Mother;
and thence upon the third, which
is our own? What right have they
to make the Sacred Heart shed
showers of roses, or to give its
form to their “mystic garden”?
Lastly, what right have they to
lodge it in the middle of a full-blown
flower, and make the latter
address to it the scented question,
“What would you desire me to do
in order that I may be agreeable
to you?” Ye well-meaning picture-makers!
beware of asking me the
same question; for both you and I
very well know what would be the
answer.</p>

<p>The truth is that these clumsy
persons manage to spoil everything
they touch, and they have dishonored
the symbolism of the dove, as
they have compromised the representations
of the Sacred Heart.
The dove is undoubtedly one of the
most ancient and evangelical of all
the Christian symbols; but a certain
discretion is nevertheless necessary
in the employment of this
emblem of the Holy Spirit of God.
This discretion never failed our
forefathers, who scarcely ever depicted
the dove, except only in
the scene of Our Lord’s baptism
and in representations of the Blessed
Trinity. In the latter the Eternal
Father, vested in pontifical or
imperial robes, holds between his
arms the cross, whereon hangs his
Son, while the Holy Dove passes
from the Father to the Son as the
eternal love which unites them.
This is well, simple, and even fine.
But there is a vast difference between
this and the present abuse
and vulgarization of the dove as an
emblem, where it is made use of to
represent the faithful soul. No,
truly, one is weary of all this. Do
you see this flight of young pigeons
hovering about with hearts in their
beaks? The beaks are very small
and the hearts very large, but
you are intended to understand by
this that “fervent souls rise rapidly
to great perfection.” These other
doves, lower down, give themselves
less trouble and fatigue; they are
quietly pecking into a heart, and I
read this legend: “The heart of
Love is inexhaustible; let us go to
it in all our wants.” The pigeon
that I see a little farther off is not
without his difficulties; he is carrying
a stout stick in his delicate
beak, and&mdash;would you believe it?&mdash;the
explanation of this remarkable
symbol is, “Thy rod and thy staff
have comforted me.” Here again
are carrier-pigeons, bringing us in
their beaks nicely-folded letters in
charming envelopes. One of these
birds [who possibly may belong to
the variety knows as tumbler pigeons]
has evidently fallen into the
water; for he is shown to us standing
to recover himself on what appears
to be a heap of mud in the
middle of the ocean, with the motto,
“Saved! he is saved!” Next I
come upon a party of doves again&mdash;always
doves!&mdash;whose occupation
is certainly no sinecure. Oars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
have been fitted to their feeble
claws, and these hapless creatures
are rowing. Here is another unfortunate
pigeon. She is in prison
with a thick chain fastened to
her left foot, and we are told
that she is “reposing on the damp
straw of the dungeon.” Further
on appears another of this luckless
species, on its back with its
claws in the air. It is dead. So
much the better. It is not I who
will encourage it to be so unwise
as to return to life. True,
in default of doves, other symbols
will not be found lacking. Here
are some of the tender kind&mdash;little
souvenirs to be exchanged between
friend and friend, wherein one finds
I know not what indescribable conglomerations
of religious sentiment
and natural friendship. Flowers,
on all sides flowers: forget-me-nots,
pansies, lilies, and underneath all
the treasures of literature: “It
is a friend who offers you these”;
“Near or far away, yours ever”;
“These will pass; friendship will
remain.” “C’est la fleur de Marie
Que je vous ai choisie.” (N.B.&mdash;This
last is in verse.)</p>

<p>I know not, my dear friend,
whether you feel with me on this
point. While persuading myself
that all these playfulnesses are
very innocent, I yet find in them a
certain something which strikes me
as interloping, and I do not like
mixtures.</p>

<p>We have also the politico-religious
pictures. Heaven forbid
that I should speak evil of the
<i lang="fr">fleurs-de-lys</i> which embalmed with
their perfume all the dear Middle
Ages to which I have devoted so
much of my life; but we have in
these pictures of which I am speaking
mixtures which are, to my
mind, detestable, and I cannot endure
this pretty little boat, of which
the sails are covered with <i lang="fr">fleurs-de-lys</i>,
its mast is the Pontifical Cross,
and its pilot the Sacred Heart. Is
another allusion to legitimacy intended
in this cross surrounded
with flowers and bearing the legend,
“My Beloved delights himself
among the lilies”? I cannot tell;
but if we let each political party
have free access to our religious
picture-stores, we shall see strange
things, and then <i lang="fr">Gare aux abeilles!</i>&mdash;“Beware
of the bees.”</p>

<p>One characteristic common to
all these wretched picturelings is
their insipidity and petty childishness.
They are a literature of
nurses and nursery-maids. The
designers must surely belong to the
female portion of humanity; for
one is conscious everywhere of the
invisible hand of woman. One is
unwilling to conceive it possible
that any one with a beard on the
chin could bring himself to invent
similar meagrenesses. These persons
are afraid of man, and have
wisely adopted the plan of never
painting him, and of making everybody
under the age of ten years.
Never have they had any clear or
serious idea of the Word, the
God made man&mdash;of him, the
mighty and terrible One, who
pronounced anathema on the
Pharisees and the sellers in the
Temple. They can but represent
a little Jesus in wax, or sugar,
or treacle; and alarmed at the loftiness
of Divinity, and being incapable
of hewing his human form in
marble, they have kneaded it in
gingerbread.</p>

<p>And yet our greatest present
want is manliness. Truly, truly, in
France we have well-nigh no more
men! Let us, then, have no more
of these childishnesses, but let us
behold in the divine splendor and
perfect manhood of the Word made
flesh the eternal type of regenerated
humanity.</p>

<h3>THE KING OF METALS<br />
<span class="smaller">FROM THE FRENCH.</span></h3>

<p>There once lived a widow named
Mary Jane, who had a beautiful
daughter called Flora. The widow
was a sensible, humble woman;
the daughter, on the contrary, was
very haughty. Many young persons
desired her in marriage, but
she found none to please her; the
greater the number of her suitors,
the more disdainful she became.
One night the mother awoke, and,
being unable to compose herself
again to sleep, she began to say her
rosary for Flora, whose pride gave
her a great deal of disquietude.
Flora was asleep near her, and she
smiled in her sleep.</p>

<p>The next day Mary Jane inquired:</p>

<p>“What beautiful dream had you
that caused you to smile in your
sleep?”</p>

<p>“I dreamed that a great lord conducted
me to church in a copper
coach, and gave me a ring composed
of precious stones that shone
like stars; and when I entered the
church, the people in the church
looked only at the Mother of God
and at me.”</p>

<p>“Ah! what a proud dream,”
cried the widow, humbly drooping
her head.</p>

<p>Flora began to sing. That same
day a young peasant of good reputation
asked her to marry him.
This offer her mother approved,
but Flora said to him:</p>

<p>“Even were you to seek me in a
coach of copper, and wed me with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
a ring brilliant as the stars, I would
not accept you.”</p>

<p>The following night Mary Jane,
being wakeful, began to pray, and,
looking at Flora, saw her smile.</p>

<p>“What dream did you have
last night?” she asked Flora.</p>

<p>“I dreamed that a great lord
came for me in a coach of silver,
gave me a coronet of gold, and
when I entered the church those
present were more occupied in
looking at me than at the Mother
of God.”</p>

<p>“O poor child!” exclaimed the
widow, “what an impious dream.
Pray, pray earnestly that you may
be preserved from temptation.”</p>

<p>Flora abruptly left her mother,
that she might not hear her remonstrances.</p>

<p>That day a young gentleman
came to ask her in marriage. Her
mother regarded this proposal as
a great honor, but Flora said to
this new aspirant:</p>

<p>“Were you to seek me in a
coach of silver and offer me a coronet
of gold, I would not wed you.”</p>

<p>“Unfortunate girl!” cried Mary
Jane, “renounce your pride.
Pride leads to destruction.”</p>

<p>Flora laughed.</p>

<p>The third night the watchful mother
saw an extraordinary expression
on her child’s countenance,
and she prayed fervently for her.</p>

<p>In the morning Flora told her
of her dream.</p>

<p>“I dreamed,” she said, “that a
great lord came to seek me in a
coach of gold, gave me a robe of
gold, and when I entered the church
all there assembled looked only
at me.”</p>

<p>The poor widow wept bitterly.
The girl left her to escape seeing
her distress.</p>

<p>That day in the court-yard of
the house there stood three equipages,
one of copper, the other of
silver, and the third of gold. The
first was drawn by two horses, the
second by four, the third by eight.
From the first two descended pages
clothed in red, with green caps;
from the third descended a nobleman
whose garments were of gold.
He asked to marry Flora. She
immediately accepted him, and ran
to her chamber to decorate herself
with the golden robe which he presented
to her.</p>

<p>The good Mary Jane was sorrowful
and anxious, but Flora’s
countenance was radiant with delight.
She left her home without
asking the maternal benediction,
and entered the church with a
haughty air. Her mother remained
on the threshold praying and weeping.</p>

<p>After the ceremony, Flora entered
the golden equipage with her husband,
and they departed, followed
by the two other equipages.</p>

<p>They drove a long, a very long
distance. At last they arrived at a
rock where there was a large entrance
like the gate of a city.
They entered through this door,
which soon closed with a terrible
noise, and they were in midnight
darkness. Flora was trembling
with fear, but her husband said:</p>

<p>“Reassure yourself; you will
soon see the light.” In truth, from
every side appeared little creatures
in red clothes and green caps&mdash;the
dwarfs who dwell in the cavities
of the mountains. They carried
flaming torches, and advanced
to meet their master, the King of
Metals.</p>

<p>They ranged themselves around,
and escorted him through long
valleys and subterranean forests.
But&mdash;a very singular thing&mdash;all the
trees of these forests were of lead.</p>

<p>At last the cortége reached a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
magnificent prairie or meadow; in
the midst of this meadow was a
château of gold studded with diamonds.
“This,” said the King of
Metals, “is your domain.” Flora
was much fatigued and very hungry.
The dwarfs prepared dinner,
and her husband led her to a table
of gold. But all the meats and all
the food presented to her were of
this metal. Flora, not being able
to partake of this food, was reduced
to ask humbly for a piece of
bread. The waiters brought her
bread of copper, of silver, and of
gold. She could not bite either of
them. “I cannot give you,” her
husband said, “the bread that you
wish; here we have no other kind
of bread.”</p>

<p>The young woman wept, and the
king said to her:</p>

<p>“Your tears cannot change your
fate. This is the destiny you have
yourself chosen.”</p>

<p>The miserable Flora was compelled
to remain in this subterranean
abode, suffering with hunger,
through her passion for wealth.
Only once a year, at Easter, she is
allowed to ascend for three days to
the upper earth, and then she goes
from village to village, begging from
door to door a morsel of bread.</p>

<p class="center">(From <cite>Le Contemporain</cite>.)</p>

<p>I. <i>Renewed Working of the Holy Spirit
in the World.</i>&mdash;We are, in a religious,
social, and political point of view, in
times of transition which we are not able
to understand, for the same reason that
no one can follow the movements of the
battle-field who is in the midst of the engagement.</p>

<p>To judge from appearances, especially
those which are nearest at hand, we are on
the brink of an abyss. The Catholic religion,
openly persecuted in Germany,
prostrated now for several years in Italy
and Spain by the suppression of the religious
congregations, attacked in all
countries, abandoned by all sovereigns,
appears, humanly speaking, to be on the
brink of destruction. There are not
wanting prophets who predict the collapse
of Christianity and the end of the
world. There are, however, manly souls
who do not allow themselves to be discouraged,
and who see grounds for hope
in the very events which fill ordinary
hearts with terror and consternation.</p>

<p>Of this number is an American religious,
Father Hecker, who has just issued
a pamphlet in English, wherein, without
concealing the difficulties of the present,
he avows his expectation of the approaching
triumph of religion.</p>

<p>His motives are drawn from the deep
faith he professes in the action of the
Holy Spirit in the church, outside of
which he does not see any real Christianity.
It is the Holy Spirit whom we
must first invoke; it is the Holy Spirit
of whom we have need, and who will
cure all our ills by sending us his gifts.</p>

<p>“The age,” he says, “is superficial; it
needs the gift of wisdom, which enables
the soul to contemplate truth in its ultimate
causes. The age is materialistic;
it needs the gift of intelligence, by the
light of which the intellect penetrates into
the essence of things. The age is captured
by a false and one-sided science; it
needs the gift of science, by the light of
which is seen each order of truth in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
true relations to other orders and in a
divine unity. The age is in disorder,
and is ignorant of the ways to true progress;
it needs the gift of counsel, which
teaches how to choose the proper means
to attain an object. The age is impious;
it needs the gift of piety, which
leads the soul to look up to God as the
heavenly Father, and to adore him with
feelings of filial affection and love. The
age is sensual and effeminate; it needs
the gift of force, which imparts to the will
the strength to endure the greatest burdens,
and to prosecute the greatest enterprises
with ease and heroism. The age
has lost and almost forgotten God; it
needs the gift of fear to bring the soul
again to God, and make it feel conscious
of its great responsibility and of its destiny.”</p>

<p>The men to whom these gifts have
been accorded are those of whose services
our age has need. A single man with
these gifts could do more than ten thousand
who possessed them not. It is to
such men, if they correspond with the
graces which have been heaped upon
them, that our age will owe its universal
restoration and its universal progress.
This being admitted, since, on the other
hand, it is of faith that the Holy Spirit
does not allow the church to err, ought
we not now to expect that he will direct
her on to a new path?</p>

<p>Since the XVIth century, the errors
of Protestantism, and the attacks upon
the Catholic religion of which it gave
the signal, have compelled the church to
change, to a certain extent, the normal
orbit of her movement. Now that she
has completed in this direction her line
of defence,<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> it is to be expected that she
will resume her primitive career, and enter
on a new phase, by devoting herself
to more vigorous action. It is impossible
to dispute the fresh strength which the
definition lately promulgated by the
Council of the Vatican has bestowed
upon the church. It is the axis on
which now revolves the church’s career&mdash;the
renewal of religion in souls, and the
entire restoration of society.</p>

<p>Do we not see an extraordinary divine
working in those numerous pilgrimages
to authorized sanctuaries, in those multiplied
novenas, and those new associations
of prayer? And do they not give
evidence of the increasing influence of
the Holy Spirit on souls?</p>

<p>What matter persecutions? It is they
which purify what remains of the too human
in the church. It is by the cross
we come to the light&mdash;<i lang="la">Per crucem ad
lucem</i>.</p>

<p>A little farther on the author explains
in what the twofold action of the Holy
Spirit consists.</p>

<p>He acts at one and the same time in
an intimate manner upon hearts, and in
a manner quite external on the church
herself.</p>

<p>An indefinite field of action conceded
to the sentiments of the heart, without a
sufficient knowledge of the end and object
of the church, would open the way
for illusions, for heresies of every kind,
and would invite an individual mysticism
which would be merely one of the forms
of Protestantism.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the exclusive point
of view of the external authority of the
church, without a corresponding comprehension
of the nature of the operations
of the Holy Spirit within the heart of
every one of the faithful, would make
the practice of religion a pure formalism,
and would render obedience servile, and
the action of the church sterile.</p>

<p>Moreover, the action of the Holy Spirit
made visible in the authority of the
church, and of the Holy Spirit dwelling
invisibly in the heart, form an inseparable
synthesis; and he who has not a clear
conception of this double action of the
Holy Spirit runs the risk of losing himself
in one or other of the extremes
which would involve the destruction and
end of the church.</p>

<p>In the external authority of the church
the Holy Spirit acts as the infallible interpreter
and the criterion of the divine
revelation. He acts in the heart as giving
divine life and sanctification.</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit, who, by means of the
teachings of the church, communicates
divine truth, is the same Spirit which
teaches the heart to receive rightly the
divine truth which he deigns to teach.
The measure of our love for the Holy
Spirit is the measure of our obedience to
the authority of the church; and the
measure of our obedience to the authority
of the church is the measure of our
love for the Holy Spirit. Whence the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
saying of S. Augustine: <i lang="la">Quantum quisque
amat ecclesiam Dei, tantum habet Spiritum
Sanctum</i>.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that no pope has done
so much for the despised rights of human
reason as Pope Pius IX.; that no
council has done better service to science
than that of the Vatican, none has better
regulated its relations to the faith; that
none has better defined in their fundamental
principles the relations of the
natural and the supernatural; and the
work of the pontiff and of the council is
not yet finished.</p>

<p>Every apology for Christianity must
henceforth make great account of the intrinsic
proofs of religion, without which
people of the world would be more and
more drawn to see the church only on her
human side.</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit, by means of the sacraments,
consummates the union of the soul
of the believer with God. It is this end
which true religion should pursue. The
placing in relief the internal life, and the
constitution of the church, and the intelligible
side of the mysteries of the
church&mdash;in short, the intrinsic reasons
of the truths of the divine revelation combined
with the external motive of credibility&mdash;will
complete the demonstration
of Christianity. Such an exposition of
Christianity, founded on the union of
these two categories of proofs, will have
the effect of producing a more enlightened
and intense conviction of religion in
the souls of the faithful, and of stimulating
them to more energetic action; and
it will have, as its last result, the opening
of the door to their wandering brethren,
and gathering them back into the bosom
of the church. With the vigorous co-operation
of the faithful, the ever-augmenting
action of the Holy Spirit will
raise the human personality to such an
intensity of strength and greatness that
there will result from it a new era for the
church and for society&mdash;an admirable era,
which it would be difficult to describe in
human expressions, without having recourse
to the prophetic language of the
inspired Scriptures.</p>

<p>II. <i>The Mission of Races.</i>&mdash;In pursuing
his study upon the action of the Holy
Spirit in the world, the author says that a
wider and more explicit exposition of the
dogmatic and moral verities of the church,
with a view to the characteristic gifts of
every race, is the means to employ in order
to realize the hopes he has conceived.</p>

<p>God is the author of the different races
of men. For known reasons of his providence,
he has impressed on them certain
characteristic traits, and has assigned to
them from the beginning the places
which they should occupy in his church.</p>

<p>In a matter in which delicate susceptibilities
have to be carefully handled, it is
important not to exaggerate the special
gifts of every race, and, on the other
hand, not to depreciate them or exaggerate
their vices.</p>

<p>It would, however, be a serious error,
in speaking of the providential mission
of the races, to suppose that they were
destined to mark with their imprint religion,
Christianity, or the church. It is,
on the contrary, God who makes the
gifts and qualities with which he has endowed
them co-operate in the expression
and development of the truths which he
created for them.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, no one can deny the
mission of the Latin and Celtic races
throughout the greater part of the history
of Christianity. The first fact which
manifested their mission and established
the influence they were to exercise was
the establishment of the chair of S.
Peter at Rome, the centre of the Latin
race. To Rome appertained the idea of
the administrative and governmental
organization of the whole world. Rome
was regarded as the geographical centre
of the world.</p>

<p>The Greeks having abandoned the
church for schism, and the Saxons having
revolted against her by heresy in
the XVIth century, the predominance
which the Latin race, united later on to
the Celtic race, assumed in her bosom,
became more and more marked.</p>

<p>This absence of the Greeks and of a
considerable part of the Saxons&mdash;nations
whose prejudices and tendencies are in
many respects similar&mdash;left the ground
more free for the church to complete her
action, whether by her ordinary or normal
development, or by the way of councils,
as that of Trent and that of the
Vatican.</p>

<p>That which characterizes the Latin and
Celtic races, according to our author, is
their hierarchical, traditional, and emotional
tendencies.</p>

<p>He means, doubtless, by this latter expression,
that those races are very susceptible
to sensible impressions&mdash;to those
which come from without.</p>

<p>As to the hierarchical sentiment of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
Celtic and Latin races, it appears to us
that for upwards of a century it has been
much weakened, if it be not completely
extinct.</p>

<p>In the following passage the author is
not afraid to say of the Saxon race:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is precisely the importance given to the
external constitution and to the accessories of
the church which excited the antipathies of
the Saxons, which culminated in the so-called
Reformation. For the Saxon races and the
mixed Saxons, the English and their descendants,
predominate in the rational element, in
an energetic individuality, and in great practical
activity in the material order.”</p>

</div>

<p>One might have feared, perhaps, a
kind of hardihood arising from a certain
national partiality in regard to which the
author would find it difficult to defend
himself against his <em>half-brethren</em> of Germany,
if he had not added:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“One of the chief defects of the Saxon mind
lay in not fully understanding the constitution
of the church, or sufficiently appreciating the
essential necessity of her external organization.
Hence their misinterpretation of the providential
action of the Latin-Celts, and their charges
against the church of formalism, superstition,
and popery. They wrongfully identified the
excesses of those races with the church of
God. They failed to take into sufficient consideration
the great and constant efforts the
church had made in her national and general
councils to correct the abuses and extirpate the
vices which formed the staple of their complaints.</p>

<p>“Conscious, also, of a certain feeling of repression
of their natural instincts, while this work of
the Latin-Celts was being perfected, they at the
same time felt a great aversion to the increase
of externals in outward worship, and to the
minute regulations in discipline, as well as to
the growth of papal authority and the outward
grandeur of the papal court. The Saxon
leaders in heresy of the XVIth century, as well
as those of our own day, cunningly taking advantage
of those antipathies, united with selfish
political considerations, succeeded in making
a large number believe that the question
in controversy was not what it really was&mdash;a
question; namely, between Christianity and infidelity&mdash;but
a question between Romanism
and Germanism!</p>

<p>“It is easy to foresee the result of such a
false issue; for it is impossible, humanly
speaking, that a religion can maintain itself
among a people when once they are led to believe
it wrongs their natural instincts, is hostile
to their national development, or is unsympathetic
with their genius.</p>

<p>“With misunderstandings, weaknesses, and
jealousies on both sides, these, with various
other causes, led thousands and millions of
Saxons and Anglo-Saxons to resistance, hatred,
and, finally, open revolt against the authority
of the church.</p>

<p>“The same causes which mainly produced
the religious rebellion of the XVIth century
are still at work among the Saxons, and are
the exciting motives of their present persecutions
against the church.</p>

<p>“Looking through the distorted medium of
their Saxon prejudices, grown stronger with
time, and freshly stimulated by the recent definition
of Papal Infallibility, they have worked
themselves into the belief&mdash;seeing the church
only on the outside, as they do&mdash;that she is purely
a human institution, grown slowly, by the
controlling action of the Latin-Celtic instincts,
through centuries, to the present formidable
proportions. The doctrines, the sacraments, the
devotions, the worship of the Catholic Church,
are, for the most part, from their stand-point,
corruptions of Christianity, having their source
in the characteristics of the Latin-Celtic races.
The papal authority, to their sight, is nothing
else than the concentration of the sacerdotal
tendencies of these races, carried to their culminating
point by the recent Vatican definition,
which was due, in the main, to the efforts
and the influence exerted by the Jesuits. This
despotic ecclesiastical authority, which commands
a superstitious reverence and servile
submission to all its decrees, teaches doctrines
inimical to the autonomy of the German
Empire, and has fourteen millions or more of
its subjects under its sway, ready at any moment
to obey, at all hazards, its decisions.
What is to hinder this Ultramontane power
from issuing a decree, in a critical moment,
which will disturb the peace and involve, perhaps,
the overthrow of that empire, the fruit of
so great sacrifices, and the realization of the
ardent aspirations of the Germanic races? Is
it not a dictate of self-preservation and political
prudence to remove so dangerous an element,
and that at all costs, from the state? Is it not
a duty to free so many millions of our German
brethren from this superstitious yoke and
slavish subjection? Has not divine Providence
bestowed the empire of Europe upon the
Saxons, and placed us Prussians at its head, in
order to accomplish, with all the means at our
disposal, this great work? Is not this a duty
which we owe to ourselves, to our brother Germans,
and, above all, to God? This supreme
effort is our divine mission!”</p>

</div>

<p>It would be impossible to enter into
the idea of the Bismarckian policy in a
manner more ingenious, more exact, and
more striking.</p>

<p>It is by presenting to Germany this
monstrous counterfeit of the church that
they have succeeded in provoking its
hatred of her, and the new empire proposes
to be itself the resolution of a
problem which can be only formulated
thus: “Either adapt Latin Christianity,
the Romish Church, to the Germanic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
type of character and to the exigences
of the empire, or we will employ all the
forces and all the means at our disposal
to stamp out Catholicity within our dominions,
and to exterminate its existence
as far as our authority and influence extend.”</p>

<p>This war against the Catholic religion
is formidable, and ought not to leave us
without alarm and without terror.</p>

<p>Truth is powerful, it is said, and it
will prevail. But truth has no power of
itself, in so far as it is an abstraction.
It has none, except on the condition of
coming forth and showing itself living
in minds and hearts.</p>

<p>What is to be done, then?</p>

<p>No thought can be entertained for a
moment of modifying Catholic dogmas,
of altering the constitution of the church,
or of entering, to ever so small an extent,
on the path of concessions. What is
needed is to present religious truth to
minds in such a manner as that they
shall be able to see that it is divine. It
is to prove to them that our religion
alone is in harmony with the profoundest
instincts of their hearts, and can alone
realize their secret aspirations, which
Protestantism has no power to satisfy.
For that, the Holy Spirit must be invoked
in order that he may develop the interior
life of the church, and that this development
may be rendered visible to the persecutors
themselves, who hitherto see
nothing in her but what is terrestrial and
human. Already a certain ideal conception
of Christianity exists amongst non-Catholics
of England and of the United
States, and puts them in the way of a
more complete conversion. As to the
Saxons, who, in these days, precipitate
themselves upon an opposite course, we
should try to enlighten their blindness.
Already we have seen the persecutors,
whether Roman or German, become themselves
Christian in their turn. We shall
see the Germans of our days exhibiting
the same spectacle. It is a great race,
that German race. Now, “the church
is a divine queen, and her aim has always
been to win to her bosom the imperial
races. She has never failed to do it, too.”</p>

<p>Already we can perceive a very marked
return movement amongst the demi-Saxons,
or Anglo-Saxons. It is a great
sign of the times.</p>

<p>At different epochs there have been
movements of this kind in England. But
none exhibited features so serious as
that of which we are witnesses in these
days. Conversions to the church multiply
without number, above all amongst
the most intelligent and influential classes
of the nation; and that in spite of the
violent cry of alarm raised by Lord John
Russell, and in spite of the attacks of
the ex-minister Gladstone, who has the
reputation of being the most eloquent
man in England.</p>

<p>The gravitation towards the Catholic
Church exhibits itself in a manner still
more general and more clear in the bosom
of the United States.</p>

<p>The Catholics in that country amounted
to scarcely a few hundreds at the
commencement of this century. They
form now a sixth of the population of
the United States. They number about
7,000,000. And the Catholic is the only
religion which makes any real progress.</p>

<p>It is, then, true “that the Catholic religion
flourishes and prospers wherever
human nature has its due liberty. Let
them but give to the church rights only
equal to those of other confessions, and
freedom of action, and we should see her
regain Europe, and, with Europe, the
world.”</p>

<p>Now, might we not conclude that these
two demi-Saxon nations, England and
the United States, are predestined by
Providence to lead the Saxons themselves
in a vast movement of return towards
the Catholic Church?</p>

<p>Before concluding, the author returns
to the Latin and Celtic nations, and directs
towards them a sorrowful glance.</p>

<p>As for France, he regrets that a violent
reaction against the abuses of the
ancient régime, of which he gives a
somewhat exaggerated picture, has
brought about an irreligious revolution
and a political situation which oscillates
ceaselessly between anarchy and despotism,
and despotism and anarchy. He
deplores still more that the progressive
movement has been diverted from its
course in Spain and in Italy by the evil
principles imported from France.</p>

<p>“At this moment,” says the author,
“Christianity is in danger, on the one
hand, of being exterminated by the persecution
of the Saxon races; on the other,
of being betrayed by the apostasy of
the Celto-Latins. This is the great tribulation
of the church at the present
time. Between these two perils she labors
painfully.”</p>

<p>According to human probabilities, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
divine bark should be on the point of perishing.
But perish it cannot. God cannot
abandon the earth to the spirit of
evil. “Jesus Christ came to establish
the kingdom of God on the earth, as a
means of conducting men to the kingdom
of God in heaven.”</p>

<p>It is thus, in his last chapter, our author
surveys the future:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“During the last three centuries, from the
nature of the work the church had to do, the
weight of her influence had to be mainly exerted
on the side of restraining human activity.
Her present and future influence, due to the
completion of her external organization, will be
exerted on the side of soliciting increased action.
The first was necessarily repressive and unpopular;
the second will be, on the contrary, expansive
and popular. The one excited antagonism;
the other will attract sympathy and cheerful
co-operation. The former restraint was exercised,
not against human activity, but against
the exaggeration of that activity. The future
will be the solicitation of the same activity
towards its elevation and divine expansion,
enhancing its fruitfulness and glory.</p>

<p>“These different races of Europe and the
United States, constituting the body of the
most civilized nations of the world, united in
an intelligent appreciation of the divine character
of the church, with their varied capacities
and the great agencies at their disposal, would
be the providential means of rapidly spreading
the light of faith over the whole world, and of
constituting a more Christian state of society.</p>

<p>“In this way would be reached a more perfect
realization of the prediction of the prophets,
of the promises and prayers of Christ,
and of the true aspiration of all noble souls.</p>

<p>“This is what the age is calling for, if
rightly understood, in its countless theories
and projects of reform.”</p>

</div>

<p>The zealous religious who is the author
of this important manifesto traversed
the seas in order to submit it to the Holy
Father. [A mistake. Father Hecker
went to Europe for other reasons, and
took advantage of the opportunity to
submit his pamphlet to the examination
of the Roman censors and other eminent
theologians.] If we are well informed,
the Roman Curia found in it neither error
nor rashness.<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> It is a complete plan of
action proposed to the apostolate of the
church for the future. The old era
would close, a new one would open.</p>

<p>On this ground all ancient differences
should disappear. Bitter and useless recriminations
would be laid aside. All
would be moving towards the same future,
in accord not only as to the end, but
as to the means.</p>

<p class="center">(From <cite>Le Monde</cite>.)</p>

<p>The <i lang="de">Culturkampf</i> advances daily. Its
war-cry in precipitating itself upon
the church, bent upon her destruction,
is: “The doctrine of infallibility has
made spiritual slaves of Catholics, who
are thus a hindrance to civilization.” In
presence of so furious an attack, every
voice which suggests means of safety deserves
our best attention.</p>

<p>Of this kind is a pamphlet published
lately in London, and which has been
already translated into French, German,
and Italian, and of which the journals of
different countries, of the most opposite
views, have given very favorable opinions.</p>

<p>The lamented M. Ravelet would, had
he been spared, have introduced it to the
readers of the <cite>Monde</cite>; for he had met its
author at Rome, and knew how to appreciate
the breadth of his views. Father
Hecker, its author, the founder of the
Paulists of New York, is celebrated in
his country for a style of polemics admirably
adapted to the genius of his fellow-countrymen.
Does he understand Europe,
to which he has made prolonged
visits, equally well? On that point our
readers will soon be able to judge.</p>

<p>How is it that the Catholic religion,
which reckons more adherents than any
other Christian religion, does not succeed
in making itself respected? Evidently
because many Catholics are not
on a level with the faith which they profess.
“We want heroes,” said J. de
Maistre at the beginning of our century.
At this moment is not the demand the
same? There is no lack of religious
practices; a number of exterior acts of
exterior piety are performed; but the interior
life of souls is not exalted; they
seem to be afflicted with a kind of spiritual
dyspepsia. The crises which threaten
terrify them, instead of inflaming beforehand
their courage and their confidence
in God. It is in the sources of religion
itself we shall find energy; it is to them
we must betake ourselves to reinvigorate
our strength, in the direct action of God
upon our consciences, and in the operation
of the Holy Spirit upon our souls.
From this source issues the true religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
life, and our external practices are
availing only so far as they are inspired
by this internal principle, itself inspired by
the Spirit of God. Herein are the primal
verities of Christianity. At every epoch
of decadence the voices of saints remind
the world of them; the spirit of the
church inclines us to them; but, distracted
by external agitations, we forget
to correspond with its suggestions. We
do not possess enough of God! Here is
our weakness. A little more of divinity
within us! Lo, the remedy!</p>

<p>Father Hecker has well written upon the
gifts of the Holy Spirit, and upon the
men our age wants. Intelligences illuminated
from on high, wills divinely
strengthened&mdash;is not that what is wanted
to maintain the struggle? Is he not right
when he asserts that one soul adorned
with these gifts would do more to promote
the kingdom of God than a thousand
deprived of them?</p>

<p>This urgent call to a more intensely
spiritual life will touch Christian hearts.
But the pamphlet foresees an objection.
Does not this development of our
faculties and of our initiative under the
divine influence expose us to some of
the dangers of Protestantism? Do we
not run the risk of the appearance of
strong individualities who, filled with
their own ideas, will think themselves
more enlightened than the church, and
so be seduced into disobeying her authority?</p>

<p>This eternal question of the relation of
liberty to authority! Catholics say to
Protestants: “Liberty without the control
of the divine authority of the church
leads insensibly to the destruction of
Christianity.” Protestants reply: “Authority
amongst you has stifled liberty.
You have preserved the letter of the
dogmas; but spiritual life perishes under
your formalism.” We are not estimating
the weight of these reproaches; we
merely state the danger. The solution
of the religious problem consists in
avoiding either extreme.</p>

<p>No Catholic is at liberty to doubt that
the Holy Spirit acts directly in the soul
of every Christian, and at the same time
acts in another way, indirect, but no less
precious, by means of the authority of
the church. Cardinal Manning has
written two treatises on this subject, one
on the external, the other on the internal,
working of the Holy Spirit. It is
these two workings which Father Hecker
endeavors to connect in a lofty synthesis,
and this is the main object of his
work.</p>

<p>The first step of the synthesis is the
statement that it is one and the same
spirit which works, whether by external
authority or by the interior impulse of
the soul, and that these two workings,
issuing from a common principle, must
agree in their exercise and blend in
their final result. The liberty of the soul
should not dispute the authority of the
church, because that authority is divine;
the church, on the other hand, cannot
oppress the liberty of the soul, because
that liberty is also divine. The second
step is to prove that the interior action
of the Holy Spirit in the soul alone accomplishes
our inward sanctification and
our union with God. The authority of the
church, and, generally, the external observances
of religion, having only for
their aim to second this interior action,
authority and external practices occupy
only a secondary and subordinate place
in the Catholic system, contrary to the
notion of Protestants, who accuse us of
sacrificing Jesus Christ to the church,
and of limiting Christianity to her external
action. The completion of the synthesis
is in the following: The individual
has not received for his interior
life the promise of infallibility; it is to
Peter and his successors&mdash;that is to say,
to the church&mdash;that Jesus Christ has conceded
this privilege. The Christian thus
cannot be sure of possessing the Holy
Spirit, excepting in so far as he is in
union with the infallible church, and that
union is the certain sign that the union
of the two workings of the Holy Spirit
is realized in him.</p>

<p>We have no doubt that this theory is
one of the most remarkable theological
and philosophical conceptions of our age.
Father Hecker is no innovator, but he
seizes scattered ideas and gathers them
into a sheaf of luminous rays; and this
operation, which seems so simple, is the
result of thirty years’ laborious meditation.
One must read the pamphlet itself to appreciate
its worth. The more we are
versed in the problems which agitate
contemporary religious thought, the better
we shall understand the importance
of what it inculcates.</p>

<p>We shall briefly dispose of the application
the author makes of his synthesis.
One most ingenious one is that Protestantism,
by denying the authority of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
church, obliges her to put forth all her
strength in its defence.</p>

<p>If Luther had attacked liberty, the
church would have taken another attitude,
and would have defended with no
less energy the free and direct action of
the Holy Spirit in souls. It is this necessary
defence of divine authority which
gave birth to the Jesuit order, and which
explains the special spirit which animates
that society. If, however, the defence
of assailed authority has been, for
three centuries, the principal preoccupation
of the church, she has not on that
account neglected the interior life of
souls. It is sufficient to name the spirituality,
so deep and so intense, of S. Philip
Neri, S. Francis of Sales, S. John of
the Cross, and S. Teresa. Moreover,
does not the support of authority contribute
to the free life of souls by maintaining
the infallible criterion for testing,
in cases of doubt, the true inspirations
of the Holy Spirit?</p>

<p>The church, in these days, resembles
a nation which marches to its frontiers
to repel the invasion of the foreigner and
protect its national life; its victory secured,
it recalls its forces to the centre,
to continue with security and ardor the
development of that same life.</p>

<p>According to Father Hecker, the church
was in the last extremity of peril. He
sees in the proclamation of the infallibility
of the Pope the completion of the
development of authority provoked by
the Reformation, and believes that nothing
now remains but its application.</p>

<p>If, since the XVIth century, external
action has predominated in the church,
without, however, ever becoming exclusive,
so now the internal working will
predominate, always leaving to the external
its legitimate share. Only, this
new phase will be, in a way, more normal
than the preceding, because, in religion
as in man, the internal infinitely
surpasses the external, without, however,
annihilating it, as does Protestantism.
This internal is the essence of Christianity;
it is the kingdom of heaven within
us, and whose frontiers it is our duty to
extend. It is the treasure, the hidden
pearl, the grain of mustard-seed, of the
Gospel. It is to this interior of the soul
that our Lord addressed the beatitudes
of the Sermon on the Mount. The external
church&mdash;the priesthood, the worship,
the sacraments&mdash;are only means divinely
instituted to help the weakness of man
to rise to the worship in spirit and in
truth announced by our Saviour to the
Samaritan woman. And the time has
come for a fuller expansion of this internal
life, for the more general development
of the spirit of S. Francis of Sales
and of the other saints of whom we spoke
above.</p>

<p>As to those outside the church, they
will never believe in this evolution, because
they suppose that the doctrine of
infallibility has condemned us to a kind
of petrifaction. But if they study the
actual situation, events will undeceive
them from this present moment.</p>

<p>The persecutions which deprive the
church of her temporalities, of her exterior
worship, of her religious edifices,
which go the length even of depriving
the faithful of their priests and bishops,
which suppress as far as they can the
external part of Catholicity, do they not
reveal the power of its interior?</p>

<p>In the parts of Switzerland and Germany
where the populations are robbed
of their clergy and worship, do we not
see faith developing in sacrifice, and piety
becoming more serious and fervent in
the privation of all external aid? This
example is an additional proof of the opportuneness
of Father Hecker’s pamphlet.
If God wills that the persecution
should increase, we must be prepared to
do without the external means which he
himself has instituted, and which he accords
to us in ordinary times. For we
must not forget that no human power can
separate us from God, and that so long
as this union exists religion remains entire
as to its substance.</p>

<p>The merit of the Christian is in the intention
which inspires his acts. Religion
exists only in the idea which clothes
its rites; the sacraments, the channels
of grace, are only effective in us as they
are preceded by the dispositions of our
soul. For a religion not to degenerate,
it must perpetually renew the internal
life, in order to resist the encroachments
of routine.</p>

<p>Here the author asks what is the polemic
best suited to help the people of
these times to escape from their unbelief,
which often proceeds from regarding the
church as having fallen into formalism
and into a debasing authoritativism.
He believes they might be undeceived
by disclosing to them the inner life of religion
and the internal proofs of her
divinity&mdash;an idea he shares with the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
illustrious writers of our age. Lacordaire
wrote to Mme. Swetchine that he
had reversed the point of view of the
controversy in scrutinizing matters from
within, which manifested truth under a
new aspect.</p>

<p>Father Hecker quotes in this sense the
striking words of Schlegel: “We shall
soon see, I think, an exposition of Christianity
appear which will bring about
union among all Christians, and convert
the unbelieving themselves.” Ranke
said with no less decision: “This reconciliation
of faith and science will be more
important, as regards its spiritual results,
than was the discovery, three centuries
ago, of a new hemisphere, than that of
the true system of the universe, or than
that of any other discovery of science, be
it what it may.”</p>

<p>The pamphlet ends with a philosophy
of race. And here the author, whilst
acknowledging his fear of wounding susceptibilities,
expresses the hope that none
of his views will be exaggerated. He
inquires what natural elements the several
races have offered to the church in
the successive phases of her history;
and, starting from the principle that God
has endowed the races with different aptitudes,
he examines in what way those
aptitudes may co-operate in the terrestrial
execution of the designs of Providence.
The Latin-Celtic races, who almost alone
remained faithful to the church in the
XVIth century, have for authority and
external observances tastes which coincide
with the more special development
of the church since that epoch.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the Anglo-Saxon
races have subjective and metaphysical
instincts which, in a natural point of view,
should attract them to the church in the
new phase on which she is entering.
Father Hecker has been accused with
some asperity of predicting that the direction
of the church and of the world
will pass into the hands of the Saxon
races, whose conversion, sooner or later,
he anticipates. But he does not in any
sense condemn the Latin races to inferiority.
He merely gives it as his opinion
that the Latin races can only issue from
the present crisis by the development of
that interior life of independent reason
and deliberate volition which constitutes
the force of the Saxon races. God has
not given the church to the Latin races.
He has not created for nothing the Saxon,
Sclavonic, and other races which cover
the surface of the globe. They have their
predestined place in the assembly of all
the children of God, and are called to
serve the church according to their providential
aptitudes.</p>

<p>Father Hecker and Dr. Newman are not
the only ones who think that the absence
of the Saxon races has been, for some
centuries, very prejudicial to the church.
J. de Maistre, whose bias cannot be suspected,
expressed himself even more explicitly
to that effect. The Latin genius,
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit,
has been and will continue to be of the
utmost value to the church. Under the
divine influence, the Saxon genius will, in
its way, effect equally precious conquests.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we summarize thus the
ideas of Father Hecker:</p>

<p>1. We have need of a spiritual awakening.</p>

<p>2. The definition of infallibility has
lent such strength to the church that
henceforth personality may become as
powerful as possible without the risk, as
in the XVIth century, of injuring unity.</p>

<p>3. This definition having completed
the external system of Catholicity, the
initiative of the church proceeds logically
to concentrate itself on the aggrandizement
of the interior life, which is the essence
of religion.</p>

<p>4. This is proved by the persecutions,
which augment and strengthen the religious
life of Catholics.</p>

<p>5. The result of these persecutions
will be to unveil to Protestants and unbelievers
the interior view of Catholicity,
and to prepare the way for religious
unity.</p>

<p>6. This unity will be effected when
Protestants and unbelievers see that
Catholicity, far from being opposed to
the aspirations of their nature, understands
them and satisfies them better
than Protestantism and free-thinking.</p>

<p>7. This expansion of Catholicity advances
slowly, because it meets few souls
great enough to admit of the full development
of its working, and of showing
what it is capable of producing in them.</p>

<p>8. The way to multiply these souls is
to place ourselves more and more under
the influence of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Whatever opinion may be formed of
certain details, on the whole, this work
manifests a high grade of philosophical
thought and theological insight. But to
appreciate it fully it must be read and
studied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span></p>

<p>Exceptions have been taken to it, on
the ground that one meets nothing in it
but theories, without any practical conclusion.
Yet what can be more practical
than the exhortation which confronts us
on every page, to seek in all our religious
acts, in sacraments, worship, and discipline,
the divine intention involved therein?
What more practical than to urge
us to develop all the forces of our nature
under the divine influence, and to tell
us that the more conscientious, reasonable,
and manly we are, the more completely
men we are, so much the more
favorable ground will the church find
within us for her working?</p>

<p>Far from urging any abrupt change,
Father Hecker recommends that everything
should be done with prudence,
consideration being had for the manners
of every country. He is persuaded that,
by placing more confidence in the divine
work in souls, they will become insensibly
stronger, and will increase thus indefinitely
the force and energy of the
whole body of the church. Such a future
will present us with the spectacle
of the conversion of peoples who at present
are bitterly hostile to her&mdash;a future
which we shall purchase at the cost of
many sacrifices. But our trials will be
full of consolations if we feel that they
are preparing a more general and abundant
effusion of divine illumination upon
the earth. <i lang="la">Per crucem ad lucem.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Personal Recollections of Lamb, Hazlitt,
and Others.</span> The Bric-à-Brac
Series. Edited by R. H. Stoddard.
New York: Scribner, Armstrong &amp;
Co. 1875.</p>

</div>

<p>This volume is a compendium of one
of those books of memoirs or personal
recollections bequeathed to us by the
survivors of the English Renaissance of
the beginning of the century&mdash;<cite>My Friends
and Acquaintances</cite>, by P. G. Patmore.
This the editor has supplemented, in the
case of Hazlitt, by some letters and reminiscences
culled from the <cite>Memoirs</cite> published
by his grandson, W. Carew Hazlitt.
These works, it might be fairly
supposed, would be of themselves light
enough for the most jaded and flippant
appetite. However, the aid of the “editor”
is called in&mdash;heaven forgive the man
who first applied that title, honored by a
Scaliger and a Bentley, to the modern
compiler of scandal!&mdash;the most entertaining
and doubtfully moral tidbits are
picked out; and the result is the class
of books before us, which is doing for
the national intellect what pastry has
done for its stomach. The mutual courtesies&mdash;honorable
enough when rightly
understood&mdash;existing between publishers
and the periodical press make honest
criticism seem ungracious; and thus the
public judgment is left uninstructed by
silence, or its frivolous tastes are confirmed
by careless approval.</p>

<p>The motives impelling the awful scissors
of the “editor” not only deprive
the original works which fall under them
of the modicum of value they may possess,
but affirmatively they do worse.
They give an absolutely false impression
of the persons represented. Thus, in the
case before us the character and genius
of Lamb are as ridiculously overrated as
his true merits are obscured; and the
same may be said with even more justice
of the portrait given of Hazlitt. Singularly
enough, though the editor derives
all he knows, or at least all he presents
to the reader, from Mr. Patmore and Mr.
Carew Hazlitt, he speaks in the most
contemptuous terms of both. One he
pronounces “not a man of note,” and
the other he terms, with a delightful unconsciousness
of self-irony, “a bumptious
bookmaker, profusely addicted to
scissors and paste”; and both he bids, at
parting, to “make room for their betters.”
If such be the character of Mr.
Patmore and Mr. Hazlitt, what opinion,
we may ask, is the reader called upon to
entertain of the “editor” who is an accident
of their existence? Nor is it in
relation only to the authors after whom
he gleans that the “editor” shows bad
taste and self-sufficiency. The immortal
author of the <cite>Dunciad</cite>, speaking of a
kindred race of authors, tells us,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Glory and gain the industrious tribe provoke,</div>
<div class="verse">And gentle Dulness ever loves a joke.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“The ricketty little papist, Pope,” is
the witticism the editor levels at the
brightest and most graceful poet of his
age&mdash;a master and maker of our English
tongue, and a scourge of just such dunces
as himself.</p>

<p>Of the writers whose habits and personal
characteristics are treated of in
this volume we have little or no room to
speak, nor does the work before us afford
any sufficient basis to go upon. Lamb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
occupies a niche in the popular pantheon,
as an essayist, higher than posterity will
adjudge him. His essays are pleasing
and witty, and the style is marvellously
pure; but they want solidity; they are
idealistic, humorous, subjective; they
fail to present that faithful transcript of
manners, or to teach in sober tones those
lessons of morality, which make the older
essayists enduring. Lamb’s other works
are already forgotten. He was an amiable
man in the midst of unhappy surroundings,
and his unassuming manners
have enshrined his name with affection
in the works of his contemporaries.</p>

<p>Hazlitt’s was not a character to be admired,
nor in many ways even to be respected.
He was devoured with vanity
and grosser passions. His work was
task-work, and therefore not high. ’Tis
true Horace tells us,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“… paupertas impulit audar</div>
<div class="verse">Ut versus facerem.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;poverty has often been the sting which
urged genius to its grandest efforts. But
Hazlitt, though undoubtedly a man of
genius, was not gifted with that genius
of the first order, which abstracts itself
wholly from the miserable circumstances
about it. The great body of his work is
criticism, brilliant, entertaining, even instructive
at the moment in which it was
produced, but substantially only the fashion
of a day.</p>

<p>Of the poet Campbell and Lady Blessington
it would be an impertinence to
say anything on the slight foundation
this volume gives us.</p>

<p>The editor of the “Bric-à-Brac” Series
has placed on the cover of each volume
this motto:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Civil Government of the States,
and the Constitutional History of
the United States.</span> By P. Cudmore,
Esq., Counsellor-at-Law, Author of the
<cite>Irish Republic</cite>, etc., etc. New York:
P. Cudmore. 1875.</p>

</div>

<p>The author of this work informs us in
the preface that his object has been to
condense into one volume the colonial,
general, and constitutional history of the
United States. This volume professes to
be a digest of the writings and speeches of
the fathers of the Constitution of the United
States, the statutes of the several States,
the statutes of the United States, of the
writings and speeches of eminent American
and foreign jurists, the journals and
annals of Congress, the <cite>Congressional
Globe</cite>, the general history of the United
States, the decisions of the Supreme
Courts of the several States, the opinions
of the attorneys-general of the United
States, and the decisions of the Supreme
Court of the United States; of extracts
from De Tocqueville, the Madison Papers,
the <cite>Federalist</cite>, Elliott’s <cite>Debates</cite>, the
writings of Jefferson, Adams, Hamilton,
and Vattel, and of extracts from Jefferson
and other eminent authors on parliamentary
law. The platforms of political parties
are also given. This list is copied
<i lang="la">verbatim</i> from the author. It will be seen,
therefore, that Mr. Cudmore has set himself
no contemptible task to accomplish,
and, as he has executed it in a thin octavo
of 254 pages, it may reasonably be
conjectured that he possesses a talent for
condensation that Montesquieu might have
envied. Mr. Vallandigham finds a powerful
advocate in this author, and his
philippics against Mr. Stanton are proportionately
severe. Mr. Cudmore has
a fondness for notes of exclamation; and
such is the ardor of constitutionalism
with which he pursues this latter-day
“tyrant of the blackest dye” (we quote Mr.
Cudmore) that it often takes three notes
of admiration to express his just abhorrence
of his measures. The bulk of the
work is taken up by a civil and military
history of the late conflict, and the disputes
that preceded it. If we might venture
a hint to Mr. Cudmore, we would
say that his tone is a little too warm for
this miserably phlegmatic age, which
affects a fondness for impartiality in great
constitutional writers. The fact is, the
questions which the author discusses with
the greatest spirit are dead issues. They
still preserve a faint vitality for the philosopher
and speculative statesman, but
they have sunk out of sight for the practical
politician and man of to-day. The
<i lang="la">vis major</i> has decided them. We might
as usefully begin to agitate for a re-enactment
of the Agrarian Laws. Mr. Cudmore’s
Chapters IV. and V., containing a
digest of State and Federal law, show
much meritorious industry. The history
of land-grants, the homestead law, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
the laws pertaining to aliens and naturalization,
will be found useful.</p>

<p>It gives us great pleasure to express,
with slight qualifications, our entire approval
of this work, so far as its moral
purport is concerned. Its plot and incidents
are all within the range of ordinary
life and experience, and therefore not
calculated to foster in the youthful reader
extravagant anticipations in regard to his

at the weaknesses and inconsistencies of
human nature, and faithful pictures of
the vices and miseries to which an unscrupulous
ambition leads. Selfishness
and injustice prosper for a time, but
eventually reap their reward; while integrity
and true manliness, even in the
rude and uncultivated, are recognized

Almanac for 1876.</span> New York: The
Catholic Publication Society.</p>

</div>

<p>“Almanac,” when applied to this publication,
seems to us a misnomer. The
popular notion of an almanac is a thin,
badly-printed pamphlet, containing incomprehensible
astrological tables, delusive
prophecies as to the weather, tradesmen’s
advertisements, and a padding of
stale jokes or impracticable recipes gathered
from country newspapers; whereas
the <cite>Illustrated Catholic Family Almanac</cite>
is an annual of 144 pages, containing
each year enough solid, well-digested information
to furnish forth an ordinary
volume of three hundred pages, to say
nothing of the many fine engravings&mdash;and
this, too, at a price which should extend
its circulation to equal that of the once-famous
<cite>Moore’s Almanac</cite> (published in
England about the beginning of the
XVIIIth century), which is said at one
time to have sold annually more than
four hundred thousand copies.</p>

<p>The several volumes of the <cite>Family Almanac</cite>
form a valuable manual for Catholics,
containing, as they do, articles of
great interest to the literary student, the
antiquarian, and the archæologist. Much
of the information could be gathered only
from exceedingly well-furnished libraries;
some of it appears here for the first
time in print.</p>

<p>In the <cite>Almanac</cite> for 1876, among other
good things, we find an extended and
very interesting biographical sketch of
His Eminence Cardinal McCloskey;
also, biographical sketches of Cardinals
Wiseman and Altieri, of Bishops Bruté
and Baraga, of Rev. Father Nerinckx
and the Cura Hidalgo&mdash;the Washington
of the Mexican revolution&mdash;and of Eugene
O’Curry, the eminent Irish scholar&mdash;all
of these being illustrated with portraits.
The approaching centenary has
not been forgotten, for in “Centennial
Memorials” is shown the part&mdash;a glorious
one, which received the public endorsement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
of the “Father of his Country,”
as will be seen by perusal of the article&mdash;taken
by Catholics of Irish origin in the
Revolutionary struggle. In the same
article are numerous statistics showing
the temporal growth of our country during
the century just closing; the article
closes with an account of the wonderful
growth of the Catholic Church during
the same period&mdash;the whole being valuable
for future reference. “About the
Bible” and “The Bible in the Middle
Ages” contain information of interest to
every Christian, and which is to be got
elsewhere only by much reading; the latter
article also contains an ample refutation
of the old slander that the Catholic
Church of the middle ages kept the
Scriptures from the laity. Besides the
foregoing, there is much curious and entertaining
prose and verse, and several
pictures of churches and other edifices
(among them one of old S. Augustine’s
Church, Philadelphia, destroyed in the
riots of 1844, and toward the building of
which, in 1796, Washington contributed
$150; Stephen Girard, $40; George
Meade, father of Gen. Meade, $50; and
Commodore Barry, $150), a complete
and authentic list of the Roman pontiffs
translated from the Italian, the American
hierarchy, and the usual astronomical
and church calendars, postal guide, etc.</p>

</div>

<p>This volume will doubtless be welcome
to those already familiar with the <cite>Memoirs</cite>
previously published. The work is
largely made up of letters which are of
no particular interest, except so far as
they throw light on the character of the

beauty, and possessing that
knowledge of public events and skill in
their interpretation which seems a special
gift of Frenchwomen, Mme. Récamier
became the centre of an admiring group
of statesmen and <i lang="fr">littérateurs</i> who sought
the benefit of her intuitive wisdom.</p>

<p>A very strong testimony to Mme. Récamier’s
many virtues is found in the
warm friendship which existed between
herself and other ladies holding a similar
position in French society; in the loving
devotion of the child of her adoption,
who subsequently became her biographer;
and&mdash;in the fear and jealousy of the First
Napoleon, who paid her the compliment
of a temporary exile. The personal attention
she gave to her adopted daughter’s

<p>Father Moriarty’s work has one merit
on which editors place a high value&mdash;brevity.
A book of travels is not properly
a history or topography of the

The interlarded extracts with which
some authors swell their volumes are
often wearisome reading. In the above
work the reverend traveller narrates all
the important incidents of his journey,
with descriptions of the various shrines
on his route, in so picturesque a manner,
and in so few words, that the reader will
have no difficulty in laying up in his
memory many pleasant subjects for reflection.</p>

<p>An entertaining volume for youthful

useful lessons. The same charming
freshness which won for <cite>Little Women</cite> its

a favorite, notwithstanding its defects&mdash;one
of which is a spirit of self-assertion
in the heroine which is only too true to
nature in the average American girl.
However reluctant we may be to acknowledge
the fact, we cannot fail to see
that our so-called progress has had a
tendency to weaken veneration for age
and respect for authority. Miss Alcott
shows her sympathy with this fault by
sometimes placing age in a ludicrous
light before her juvenile readers. The
young people of this generation do not
need any encouragement in the belief
that age does not always bring wisdom,
and we the more regret this mistake in a
book otherwise commendable. Destroy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>

<p>This is a new volume added to the already

<h3>THE PRESIDENT’S SPEECH AT DES MOINES.</h3>

<p>The utterances of any person
occupying so lofty a station as that
of President of the United States
demand attention and respect, by
reason of the source from whence
they emanate. The deliberate
judgments of such a man as President
Grant have in themselves a
special claim to the consideration
of his fellow-citizens. He has had
opportunities to study the length
and breadth of the land. His private
convictions have matured
amidst the most varied experience
of all classes and sections of our
people&mdash;first in a profession affording
ample leisure and abundant
means of observation from an independent
stand-point, and afterwards
in commercial life, which
placed him in the midst of daily
events, no longer as a theorist, but
as one actively concerned in their
course and development. His position
in military affairs has been
that of one of the most celebrated
commanders of the age, and his
political career has been that of
an independent statesman, always
wielding supreme influence, and
quite beyond the need of vulgar
trickery, in order to maintain its
power. Having almost completed
an illustrious public life, he is now
able to express the results of his
observations, and no one can lightly
question the validity of his conclusions.
The country is prepared
to receive anything he may have
to say to it, with solicitous, intelligent,
and earnest consideration.</p>

<p>Those who may differ from him
in political convictions, or who may
retain a partiality for some of his
less successful competitors for the
highest prize of military glory, and
even those who go so far as to
question his greatness&mdash;all must
admit that he is a true American,
formed and moulded by the events
in which he has moved, and truly
representing the country and the
times.</p>

<p>We are disposed, therefore, to
attach the fullest importance to his
words, whether spoken officially or
from the convictions of his heart,
and to ponder them respectfully and
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>On the 29th of September last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
His Excellency attended, at Des
Moines, the capital city of Iowa, a
convention of the “Army of the
Tennessee,” one of those military
organizations composed of veterans
of the late war. The nature of
these and kindred associations is
not political. Their aim is to keep
up a brotherly spirit among those
who formerly stood shoulder to
shoulder on the battle-field. Nevertheless,
the gallant men, who thus
risked life and limb for the integrity
of the national government, are
supposed to retain their patriotism,
and to look with pride and zeal
upon the continuance and healthy
growth of those institutions, which
are vitally connected with the nation’s
greatness.</p>

<p>In the midst of such an assembly,
composed of men of all creeds,
our chief magistrate felt called upon
to utter a prophetic warning, which
has excited much comment at home,
and has been extensively published
abroad. We print his speech, delivered
at the evening session of
the “Army of the Tennessee,” as
currently reported in the daily
press. President Grant, being called
for, came forward and said:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Comrades</span>: It always affords me
much gratification to meet my comrades
in arms of ten and fourteen years ago,
and to tell over again from memory the
trials and hardships of those days&mdash;of
hardships imposed for the preservation
and perpetuation of our free institutions.
We believed then, and we believe now,
that we have a government worth fighting
for, and, if need be, dying for. How
many of our comrades paid the latter
price for our preserved Union! Let their
heroism and sacrifice be ever green in
our memory. Let not the result of their
sacrifices be destroyed. The Union and
the free institutions for which they died
should be held more dear for their sacrifices.
We will not deny to any of those
who fought against us any privilege under
the government which we claim for
ourselves. On the contrary, we welcome
all such who come forward in good faith
to help build up the waste places, and
to perpetuate our institutions against all
enemies, as brothers in full interest with
us in a common heritage; but we are not
prepared to apologize for the part we took
in the war.</p>

<p>“It is to be hoped that like trials will
never again befall our country. In this
sentiment no class of people can more
heartily join than the soldier who submitted
to the dangers, trials, and hardships
of the camp and the battle-field, on whichever
side he fought. No class of people
are more interested in guarding against a
recurrence of those days. Let us, then,
begin by guarding against every enemy
threatening the prosperity of free republican
institutions. I do not bring into
this assemblage politics, certainly not
partisan politics; but it is a fair subject
for the soldiers, in their deliberations, to
consider what maybe necessary to secure
the prize for which they battled. In a
republic like ours, where the citizen is
the sovereign and the official the servant,
where no power is exercised except by
the will of the people, it is important that
the sovereign, the people, should foster
intelligence&mdash;that intelligence which is
to preserve us as a free nation. If we are to
have another contest in the near future of
our national existence, I predict that the
dividing line will not be Mason and
Dixon’s, but between patriotism and intelligence
on the one side, and superstition,
ambition and ignorance on the
other.</p>

<p>“Now, the centennial year of our national
existence, I believe, is a good time
to begin the work of strengthening the
foundations of the structure commenced
by our patriotic forefathers one hundred
years ago at Lexington. Let us all labor
to add all needful guarantees for the security
of free thought, free speech, a free
press, pure morals, unfettered religious
sentiments, and of equal rights and privileges
to all men, irrespective of nationality,
color, or religion. Encourage free
schools, and resolve that not one dollar
appropriated for their support shall be
appropriated to the support of any sectarian
schools. Resolve that neither the
State nor nation, nor both combined, shall
support institutions of learning other
than those sufficient to afford every child
growing up in the land the opportunity
of a good common-school education, unmixed
with sectarian, pagan, or atheistical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
dogmas. Leave the matter of religion
to the family altar, the church, and the
private school, supported entirely by private
contributions. Keep the church
and the state for ever separate. With
these safeguards, I believe the battles
which created the Army of the Tennessee
will not have been fought in vain.”</p>

</div>

<p>Taking all things into consideration,
the speech is fully equal to
any written production of the President.
It is direct. It is plain. It
is manly and vigorous, and far superior
to any other oration which
we have heard of from the same
distinguished quarter. Beyond all
things it expresses, better than many
imagine, the common sentiments
of the American people.</p>

<p>We have not been surprised at
the general applause with which
it has been greeted; and we think
that all our readers will agree in
the judgments which we are about
to express with regard to it.</p>

<p>An impression has been spread
abroad that the views of President
Grant are hostile to the Catholic
Church, and that the speech was
fulminated by his zeal against it.
It has been averred that he was
talked into making a public manifestation
of his feelings by the
mayor of the city of Des Moines,
who called his attention to the political
campaign in Ohio, where
Catholics were vainly struggling for
equal rights in the matter of the
public schools. His Excellency is
said to have been strongly moved,
and hastened home from his ride,
in order to prepare his speech for
the evening. We have no means
of definitely ascertaining the motives
of the President’s speech. If
he meant to hurl a thunderbolt at
us, we honor him for using language,
in the main, so just and courteous.
But if his friends have sought to
make use of him to stir up feeling
against us, they must be sadly disappointed
at his words; for, if they
now repeat them too freely, for the
purpose of injuring us, they will
find themselves “hoist by” their
“own petard.”</p>

<p>Trying as hard as we can to lash
ourselves into fury; trying to fancy
ourselves insulted, by representing
to ourselves that the head of this
nation has gone out of his way and
abased his dignity, in order to cast
an aspersion at a large and respectable
class of the community, we
are forced to give it up, and to lay
down our pen; for we find nothing
in the oration with which we are in
the least disposed to take issue.
On the contrary, we are prepared
to join our tribute to the burst of
applause which echoes through the
land. We are convinced that, if it
meets with the attention which it
merits, the country at large, and
Catholics in particular, will treasure
the “Des Moines speech”
among the “Sayings of the Fathers.”
Like Washington’s Farewell,
and Webster’s mighty peroration,
and Lincoln’s noble and pathetic
Inaugural, it will pass from
the vulgar atmosphere of party
strife into the pure and serene empyrean
of immortality.</p>

<p>We have given the speech at
length. We now propose to explain
our decision with regard to it, and
to examine at greater length those
portions of it which seem to us most
true, most wise, and most remarkable.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Encourage free schools</span>,”
the President says, “<span class="smcapuc">AND RESOLVE
THAT NOT ONE DOLLAR APPROPRIATED
FOR THEIR SUPPORT SHALL
BE APPROPRIATED FOR THE SUPPORT
OF ANY SECTARIAN SCHOOLS</span>.”</p>

<p>Do we hear aright? Does the
President of the United States maintain
the proposition which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
brought us so much contempt and
derision?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">What is a free school?</span> A
free school is one in which every
scholar can obtain an education
without violating the honest convictions
of conscience, or&mdash;to use
the words of the President&mdash;a free
school is one where education can
be obtained “unmixed with sectarian,
pagan, or atheistical dogmas.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Are our so-called common
schools free?</span> Let us glance at
the general history of the controversy
concerning them. As soon
as the public schools had ceased
to be purely charitable institutions,
a new policy was inaugurated by
our people. The government assumed
that it was bound to ensure
an intelligent use of the franchise,
by encouraging the mental activity
of its citizens. To this all Catholics
agreed, and still agree. But our
Protestant fellow-citizens, rightly
desiring that some religious instruction
should be given their children,
wrongly insisted upon having the
Bible read in the schools. The
government might have permitted
such a custom to continue, when
no protest was made against it.
But it soon became evident that
the schools were essentially Protestant
institutions, and served as
an instrument to prevent the growth
of “Popery.” This was no secret.
It was openly preached.</p>

<p>About this time Catholics began
to see what everybody else was rejoicing
over, and were, naturally,
alarmed. They had assisted to
found and build up the republic,
or they had immigrated under the
assurance of equal rights. To find
it proclaimed a Protestant country
was news to them. They insisted
that the Government was bound to
deny this imputation, and they
registered an universal protest
against the design of the falsely so-called
“common” schools.</p>

<p>We have demanded either that
we be relieved from taxation for
these sectarian schools, or that
such arrangement be devised as
shall render them equally desirable
for Catholics and non-Catholics.</p>

<p>We were not called upon to explain
why we so earnestly desired
this. It was nobody’s business but
our own. The public schools are
not held to be eleemosynary institutions.
They are ostensibly for
the benefit of all. And even if they
were places for the confinement of
criminals, or almshouses, both criminals
and paupers have consciences,
however dull or uninformed.
What, then, is the objection to
our having a right to direct the policy
on which public institutions are
to be conducted? None. But if we
were to have taken such a position
as this, we should, at once, have
been indicted, for an insidious and
damnable conspiracy.</p>

<p>Therefore we have openly stated
the grounds of our convictions, relying
on the inherent force of truth
to secure our rights. We regard
morality as inseparable from religion.
In this we merely echo the
sentiments of the greatest American
statesmen, and notably, of the
Father of our republic. We say
that, if we are to pay for the education
of our children, we should
like to have the worth of our money.
What fairer demand can a
Yankee make? We ask nothing
to which every citizen has not a
right. We have never met a fair
reply to our demands, or a fair discussion
of their merits. First we
were greeted with silent scorn.
The practical operation of the laws
was found to force our children
into Protestant schools. We proclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
claimed them to be Protestant
schools. It was unblushingly denied.
We put the question to the
test, by endeavoring to stop the
Protestant Bible from being read in
them. There was not enough power
in our voice, nor enough fairness
in our opponents, to enforce
even an appearance of consistency.
The schools were pronounced “un-sectarian,”
a Protestant service was
daily carried out, and we were bidden
to hold our tongues, and to be
thankful. And, now, that we are
not willing, either to hold our peace,
or to be grateful to those who deny
us our equal rights, a loud outcry
is raised, and every manner of evil
is predicted, unless we are forcibly
restrained. The party of malevolence
seeks to create an issue where
none exists, and to force us into a
strife, in which it can avail itself
of superior numbers to strike us a
cruel and unjust blow. Now, neither
this design nor the clamor with
which it is urged, can be defended
by any true or just plea. And we
venture to predict that there is too
much intelligence and love of fair
play in the American people, to allow
it to succeed in its sinister purpose.</p>

<p>What is our position once more?
Here we stand, on the same basis
with all other American citizens.
Is it not so? Where, then, is any
legal disability proved against us?
We ask for nothing which we are not
willing to concede to all our fellow-citizens&mdash;viz.,
the natural right to
have their children brought up according
to their parents’ conscientious
convictions. We want, and
we will have, our children brought up
Catholics. It can be done in various
ways. The state can pay the
salaries of our teachers, and the
cost of our buildings, and other expenses,
securing proper guarantees
that the money will be honestly
laid out, and the children receive
their due amount of secular instruction.
Again, the state may
pay a <i lang="la">pro rata</i>, and allow teachers
to compete for scholars. This is
done in Protestant England and
Prussia, as well as in Catholic
France and Austria, and is, obviously,
most in harmony with democratic
principles. Other ways may
be devised which will secure justice
to all parties. There is no practical
difficulty, except in the smallest
country school districts. These
are always settled by the citizens
themselves. Or, we can educate
our children, without the state.
The state may let us alone, and
may do away entirely with public education,
except for those who are utterly
without means&mdash;in other words,
change the common schools into
charitable institutions, and let parents
provide. But this, we are
persuaded, is full of practical difficulties.</p>

<p>But the plan actually adopted
has been to tax all alike for the common
good, and yet maintain a system,
which perfectly suits Protestants,
but to which Catholics cannot
honestly or conscientiously agree.
<span class="smcap">Our so-called common schools
are not free.</span> Millions of the people
rise up and proclaim it. Let
those who like them send their children
to them. Let those support
them who like them by their
“private contributions.” Then all
honor to President Grant when he
says “that not one dollar should
be appropriated to the support of
any sectarian schools.”</p>

<p>The President further says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Resolve that neither State
nor Nation, nor both combined,
shall support Institutions
of Learning other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
than those sufficient to afford
every Child growing up
in the Land the opportunity
of a good Common-school
Education, unmixed with Sectarian,
Pagan, or Atheistical
Dogmas.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>Now, what is it that Catholics
complain of, except that the state
has supported, and does support,
“institutions of learning” mixed
“with sectarian, pagan, and atheistical
dogmas”?</p>

<p>There is no doubt about this
fact. Protestants insist upon having
the Bible read in the public
schools, lest they become irreligious.
Catholics maintain that the
version used is garbled, and that,
even if it were not, no one has a
right to teach it, except those who
have compiled it, and are to-day
the only responsible witnesses to
its true meaning. The Jews maintain
that the New Testament part
of it is not true. Infidels deny it
altogether. What right has any
school board, or any other purely
human institution to decide this
controversy; and what right has
any man under the Constitution to
enforce his religious views or his
denial of religion upon others? It
is an outrage. It is an inconsistency,
which cannot be stated in
any terms without transparently
manifesting its absurdity. Under
the Constitution, and according to
the spirit of our government, all men
are equal. Under the present system
of common schools, and, according
to the spirit of those who uphold
them, men are not equal, and there
is no such thing as regard for conscience;
but every majority has a
right to enforce upon any minority,
no matter how large, its peculiar
ideas of instruction, involving, as this
always does, the question of religion
itself. We have repeated our protest,
until we are almost sick and
tired of hearing the outrage mentioned;
we have never seen our
position manfully approached within
beat of drum; and, yet, we have
constantly been forced to ask ourselves,
“Will the American people
never see this? Can it be that
our enemies are, as some of them
hold themselves to be, totally depraved?”</p>

<p>Some time ago, after considerable
agitation, the Chicago School Board
prohibited the reading of the Sacred
Scriptures in the public
schools of that city.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the protest of Catholics
had something to do with
this. But the action of the board
was certainly based upon the idea,
that the reading of the Protestant
Bible made the schools Protestant,
“sectarian” institutions, and therefore
unjust towards all other religious
bodies. Let it be thoroughly
understood, that we fully appreciate
the desire of our Protestant fellow-citizens,
to hallow secular instruction.
But the reading of the Scriptures
as a public ceremony is as distinctive
to them, as the celebration
of Mass would be to Catholics. No
one can evade the argument which
forces this conclusion. “Such
schemes are glass; the very sun
shines through them.” And yet it
is not a little remarkable, how
slowly the light breaks in upon
the seat of the delusion.</p>

<p>It is a satisfaction, however, to
note the few acknowledgments,
tardy and incomplete as they are,
of the principle which we have always
maintained. Prof. Swing, alluding
to the action of the Chicago
School Board to which we have referred,
gives voice to the following
observations of common sense:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The government has no more right to
teach the Bible than it has to teach the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
Koran. My idea is that the government
did, in its earlier life, run according to a
sort of Christian common law; but now
the number of Jews, Catholics, and infidels
has become so greatly increased, the
government has to base itself squarely
upon its constitutional idea that all men
are religiously equal. Even if the genius
of the country permitted the teaching
of the Bible, I should doubt the propriety
of continuing the custom, because
no valuable moral results can ever come
from reading a few verses hurriedly in a
school-house, and social strifes will be
continually springing up out of the practice.”</p>

</div>

<p>The government, then, according
to the professor, has no rights in
the spiritual domain&mdash;a proposition
which we have been condemned to
universal derision for maintaining,
and yet one that is self-evident to
any person who will pause for a
moment to consider our institutions.</p>

<p>An ardent advocate of what are
called liberal principles, commenting
upon the position of Prof.
Swing, very properly styles it the
only one defensible. The purpose
of the Liberal League is, unquestionably,
to procure the complete
secularization of our public schools,
which would, of course, be as unjust
towards Catholic tax-payers
as any other system. This class is
no less hostile to justice and true
liberty than any other set of meddlers.
Nevertheless, it is not a little
amusing to see the unmistakable
fear with which it regards the issue
of the present anti-Catholic policy.
It waves, as its flag of hostility to
the Catholics, the threadbare pretext,
that we are secretly opposed
to all education. It is not necessary
for us to repeat the indignant
denial and protest, with which we
have ever met this gratuitous calumny.
We quote from the Boston
<cite>Index</cite> of Oct. 28:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The public-school system is to-day
in the greatest danger, not so much from
the fact that it is openly attacked from
without by the Catholics, as from the fact
that a great inherent injustice to all non-Protestants
is made part and parcel of it
by its distinctively Protestant character.
What is built on wrong is built on the
sand; and our school system will certainly
fall in ruins by and by, unless it
can be grounded on equal justice to all.”</p>

</div>

<p>When the avowed heathen, who
reap the fullest harvest, fear for the
destruction of our present unjust
system of education, on the ground
that it is too iniquitous to last, is it
not time, for people who call themselves
Christians, to give a moment’s
heed to the petition, which
we have for years addressed to
them, as most advantageous to all
of us, and as doing injustice to
none?</p>

<p>It appears, however, that this
idea has infiltrated into other
minds. <cite>Zion’s Herald</cite>, a Methodist
journal, quoted by the liberal paper
to which we have referred,
says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The state deals only with temporal
affairs, and does not attempt to usurp
spiritual functions. Therefore the objects
and methods of public education
are wholly secular, but by no means necessarily,
or at all, immoral or irreligious.
On the contrary, they are decidedly favorable
to piety and morality. But composed
denominationally as the American
people is, the state ought not to impart
religious education. The moment such
an attempt should be made, the community
would be in conflict as to what form
it should take. It may be conceded,
without danger perhaps, that the state
should not teach ethics, except so far as
the great fundamental principles of morals
and politics, as to which all Americans
are agreed, are concerned. <em>The religious
education of children may and should
be remitted to the family, the Sabbath-school,
and the church</em>&mdash;the natural and divinely-appointed
guardians of religion and
ethics.”</p>

</div>

<p>In the face of this growing acknowledgment
of the “sectarian”
character of our public schools, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
knowing that they must give religious
instruction or else be “pagan
and atheistical,” we are pleased to
hear the demand that “neither the
State nor nation, nor both combined,”
shall support such schools.</p>

<p>The fact is, that a people cannot
wholly escape from its national traditions,
without forgetting its language,
or undergoing some violent
revolution. If our fellow-citizens
will study the meaning of the terms
which they habitually use, they will
not lose their traditions of freedom
and equal rights, nor will they
throw themselves into a violent,
perilous departure from them. But
we hasten to comment upon another
sentence, which is frequently
quoted from the President’s oration:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Leave the matter of religion
to the family altar, the
church, and the private school
supported by private contributions.</span>”</p>

<p>Precisely so. If it must come to
this; if no arrangement can be
made, by which religion and morality
can be taught in the public
schools, then, leave the matter to
the family altar and the church,
and allow it to be done by private
contributions.</p>

<p>In other words, either furnish
the people with that which you
pretend to tax them for&mdash;viz., a fair
and equitable system of public
schools&mdash;or allow them to provide
for themselves. But, whatever you
do, keep your hands off the sacredness
of the “family altar.” Do not
set foot into the hallowed precincts
of the domestic sanctuary. The
family, though subordinate, is not
to be violated by the state. Parents
have rights, which no government
can usurp. You have no
more right to force the education
of their children out of their hands,
than to define the number of offspring
by law. You have no more
right to establish a system, to which
you will endeavor to secure their
conformity by violent measures,
than you have to establish public
wet-nurseries, or, require that voters
shall be brought up on government
pap and be fed out of a government
spoon.</p>

<p>Keep from meddling with religion;
you have no authority to
teach it.</p>

<p>What a bitter rebuke these words
of the President contain for that
party, small and contemptible in
itself, but powerful by reason of the
times, which has ever sought to
widen the gulf between us and our
true-hearted countrymen! It is not
enough that we should be estranged
by the traditions of three hundred
years. It is not enough to whisper
into the popular ear every stale and
loathed calumny. It is not enough
to bring our holiest rites and beliefs
into the obscene literature now circulating
amongst the depraved
youth of our country. It is not
enough to drown with a thousand
noisy, insolent tongues, every attempt
we make at explanation. It
is not enough for this malignant,
persecuting power to drop its poison
into every crevice of our social
and religious system, from the parlor
to the sewer, from the temple
to the lupanar; but the nation must
be organized against us. Our religion
must, in some way or other, be
dragged into politics. For shame!
we cry, with the President. In a
country of such varied religious beliefs
as ours, there is but one way
to order and peace&mdash;“<span class="smcap">Keep the
church and the state for ever
separate.</span>”</p>

<p>To sum up: We agree with the
President:</p>

<p>1st. No “sectarianism” in our
common schools; and, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
“not one dollar” to our present
system of schools, because they are
sectarian.</p>

<p>2d. “Not one dollar” to “pagan”
schools, in which God is ignored.</p>

<p>3d. “Not one dollar” to “atheistical”
schools, in which God is denied
in the name of “science falsely
so-called.”</p>

<p>We now turn to consider the
prophecy in which the President
warns the American people of its
future dangers:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">If we are to have another
Contest in the near future
of our national existence, I
predict that the Dividing
Line will not be Mason and
Dixon’s, but between Patriotism
and Intelligence on the
one side, and Superstition,
Ambition, and Ignorance On
the other.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>What is meant by superstition?</p>

<p>Formerly it meant seeking for
power or knowledge, by dealing
with the impure spirits.</p>

<p>Does the President mean to warn
us against the delusions and uncleanness
of modern spiritism? If
so, we are agreed.</p>

<p>But we do not really suppose
that the President means any such
thing. What does he mean?</p>

<p>We find in the dictionary four
other meanings of the word which
he has used. Superstition means
“an excessive reverence or fear
of that which is unknown or mysterious.”
But, we observe no
such phenomenon among our people;
if anything, rather the reverse.
Or it means “The worship
of false gods.” We see no signs
of this except in the “Joss
Houses” of San Francisco. Nor
do we behold any great belief “in
the agency of superior powers in
certain extraordinary or singular
events, or in omens, or prognostics.”
Nor, further, do we behold
any “excessive nicety or scrupulous
exactness,” as an alarming feature
of our present moral condition.
There remains but one meaning
(and this, we are persuaded, is
the sense which the President intended
to convey): “Especially,
an ignorant or irrational worship of
the supreme Deity.”</p>

<p>An ignorant worship of God is
one which knows not what to believe
concerning him, or one which
is unable to state what it does believe;
or, further, one which can give
no conclusive reason for believing
anything. But, outside the Catholic
Church, there is no religious body
which can tell precisely what it
ought to believe, or precisely what
it does believe, or precisely why it
ought to believe anything. Again,
an irrational belief in God is one
which recognizes his existence, and,
at the same time, denies his attributes.
For instance, it is an irrational
belief in God, which denies
his wisdom; which asserts, that he
has not chosen means adequate to
accomplish his ends; which represents
him, when he has made a revelation
to man, as leaving his divine
truth in scattered and mysterious
writings in an obscure language,
requiring men to find them, collect
them, and believe their true meaning
in order to be saved; or which
fancies that reading daily a few
pages from these writings, to little
children, will be sufficient to prepare
them for the duties of life. It
is an irrational belief in God which
represents him as immoral, as creating
man simply to damn him, or,
which denies his justice, by wickedly
imagining that he will not
punish oppression and calumny and
those who sow discord in the midst
of a free and happy people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span></p>

<p>Here again we agree with the
President in denouncing such impiety,
and in predicting that, if the
liberties and institutions of this republic
are soon to be jeopardized,
it will be by irreverence towards
God and the contempt of charity
and justice towards men, ever practised
by this “ignorant and irrational
worship of the supreme Deity.”</p>

<p>Another item of danger which
the President foresees in the near
future is “ignorance.” Here, again
we find him sounding the note of
warning, to which we have always
given voice. His Excellency says:
“In a republic like ours, …
where no power is exercised except
by the will of the people, it is important
that the sovereign, the
people, should foster intelligence&mdash;that
intelligence which is to preserve
us as a free nation.” The
liberties of this republic will not be
maintained, we say, by an ignorant,
debauched, and corrupted generation.
Our common people must be
educated. They must possess
“that intelligence which is to preserve
us as a free nation.” They
must know something more than
simply how to read and write and
“cipher.” Nor will it be sufficient,
to add to this a knowledge of music.
They must have a sound and thorough
moral training. Their conscientious
convictions must be
grounded on truth daily taught and
daily enforced. They must be
daily taught to control their passions;
they must be taught honesty,
and be required to give back that
which is unjustly gotten. They
must be taught the true purpose of
life.</p>

<p>But this training, as the President
affirms, belongs not to the state,
but to the “family altar and the
church.” Either assist <em>all</em> families
and <em>all</em> churches, or else encourage
them to help themselves. These are
our sentiments. But when sectarian
bigotry has gotten hold of a system
of the falsely so-called “common
schools,” and with obstinate purpose,
and clamorous intensity and
ever-swelling declamation, manifests
its resolve to maintain this
system, even though it conflicts with
the conscientious rights of millions
of the people of our country; when,
further, it is determined to force a
large minority to accept this state
of things, or to go without instruction,
we, as American citizens, denounce
the system as tyrannous; in
the full sense of the word, as a reckless
and immoral oppression. We
assert that those who uphold it, do
not desire intelligence, but prefer
ignorance; that their aim is not to
promote knowledge, but to destroy
the religious convictions of our children,
and to keep us from growing
in the land. We affirm that such
self-delusion originates in ignorance,
is perpetuated by ignorance, tends
to still deeper degradation of ignorance;
and we predict that it will
bring forth the fruits of ignorance,
not only in morality, but in the
lower sciences.</p>

<p>We, for our part, will never relax
our efforts to show up the dishonesty
of this party; we will never
withdraw our protest, until justice
has been done; and knowing to
what lengths men can go when
they start without principle, we fully
share in the alarm of our chief
magistrate, as to the danger of “ignorance.”
Have we not, therefore,
reason to hope that, in the midst of
the struggle, which his sagacious
mind perceives to be at hand, we
shall find him on the side of patriotism
and intelligence, with all true
Americans, against that “superstition”
and “ignorance,” whose aim
is to destroy the “security of unfettered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
religious sentiments and equal
rights” of his fellow-citizens?</p>

<p>There is another item of the future
contest, which, according to
our President, is</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Ambition</span>.” <span class="smcap">What is ambition?</span></p>

<p>A man has been elected to the
highest office in the gift of a free
people, the limits of which have
been fixed by a custom handed
down by the fathers of the nation,
and which, to the minds of true patriots,
has the force of law. When
such a trust does not satisfy the
honored recipient, and he, yielding
to personal motives, strains every
nerve, and seeks by every means at
his command, to break down all
barriers to continuation of power,
thereby abusing the dignity of his
post and the confidence of the people&mdash;that
is ambition.</p>

<p>We do not fully share the apprehension
with which the President
foresees this threat to the “near
future” of our national welfare.
But if it be true, we fully agree with
him when he says: “Now, the centennial
year of our national existence,
I believe, is a good time to
begin the work of strengthening
the foundations of the structure
commenced by our patriotic forefathers
one hundred years ago at
Lexington.”</p>

<p>“Language,” according to a great
diplomatist, “was given to man, in
order that he might conceal his
ideas.” But this maxim has never
been accepted by honorable men.
In examining, thus briefly, the
“Des Moines speech,” we have followed
that other canon of criticism,
which requires that words shall be
interpreted in their literal sense, as
far as possible. Submitted to this
just criticism, the language appears
to us immortal, and worthy of the
high place which is even now being
prepared for it. Some may marvel,
and may wonder how the President
came to be filled with so high a degree
of the prophetic spirit. Like
Balaam, the son of Beor, he was
expected to curse us; unlike Balaam,
he was not stayed, but rather
urged on by the faithful servant
with whom he previously conversed.
But there is no mystery about it.
He has grown up with the instincts
of a true American, and he
has spoken accordingly. Not only
are the words on which we have
commented true, but they are in accordance
with sound Catholic principles.
We are ready to take him at
his word, and his words in their true
meaning. To those who will join
us we say, without disguise or reserve:
“Gentlemen, you will never
regret having trusted us, and dealt
fairly with us, according to the laws
and Constitution of this country.”
We believe with the President, that,
if the only honest meaning of his
language be as honestly carried
out, “the battles which created the
Army of the Tennessee” (which, by
the way, a Catholic general once
commanded and in whose ranks
hundreds of Catholic hearts bled)&mdash;we
believe, we say, that these battles
“will not have been fought in
vain.” The children of the soldiers
of the Union will at least be the
peers of those whom their fathers
overcame. The nations’ heroes
will not look down, to see their
heirs defrauded of equal rights in
“the Union and the free institutions
for which they died.” The President
will yield to his comrades in
arms, at least as much as he is so
ready to accord to his late opponents.
And as for our countrymen
throughout the Union, we are prepared
to wait, trusting that when
fully enlightened, they will agree to
our obtaining, independently of all
political agitations or party organizations,
our just and equal rights
as American citizens.</p>

<h3>A MESSAGE.</h3>

<p>Is there anything more tantalizing
than to be caught with a toothache
and swelled face just at Christmas
time, when one’s hands are
full of work that must be finished,
of plans that have been begun in
time and carried on prosperously
to within a few days of their fulfilment?
This is just what befell Mr.
Stephen Walpole on the 20th of
December in the year of grace
1870. You remember what a terrific
winter that was? How the
bleak north wind blew over ice and
snow, and added tenfold horrors to
the poor soldiers fighting in that
terrible Franco-German war&mdash;how
all our hearts shuddered in pity for
them, as we sat stitching and knitting
in their service by the glow of
our Christmas fires! This 20th of
December was, perhaps, the bitterest
day of the whole season. The
snow was deep on the ground, the
ice hung in long spikes from rails
and roofs, and the east wind blew
cruelly over all. Stephen Walpole
ought to have been out breasting
it, but, instead of this, he sat at
home moaning, in a voice that
sounded like a fog-bell at sea,
through poultices, wadding, and
miles of flannel that swelled his
head out of all human proportions.</p>

<p>“To think of a man being knocked
down by a thing no bigger than
a pin’s point!” he grumbled. “A
prick of that miserable atom one
calls a nerve turns the seat of one’s
intellect into a monster calf’s head,
and makes one a spectacle to gods
and men. I could whip myself for
being such a milksop as to knock
under to it. I’d rather have every
tooth in my head pulled out than
play the woman like this.… Och!
Whew!”</p>

<p>“Serves you right, sir, for your
impertinence!” protested Nelly
Walpole, bridling up and applying
a fresh hot poultice to her brother’s
cheek, which she bade him hold;
but Stephen, in his manly inability
to bear the toothache with composure,
dropped the soft mess under
a sudden sting that jerked it out of
his hand.</p>

<p>“What an unmanageable baby it
is!” cried Nelly, catching the poultice
in time to save her pretty violet
cashmere dress. “I told you to
hold your cheek while I fastened
the bandage; make haste now before
it cools.”</p>

<p>“O my unfortunate brother!
Ill-fated man! Is this how I find
you, bound and poulticed in the
hands of the Philistines?”</p>

<p>This was from Marmaduke, Nelly’s
younger brother, who entered
while the operation was going on,
and stood surveying the victim in
serene compassion.</p>

<p>“Yes,” cried Stephen, “and all
the pity a poor devil gets is being
bullied for not holding his jaw.”</p>

<p>“Oh! come, you’re not so bad,
since there’s vice enough in you for
a pun!” said Marmaduke. “How
did you catch the thing?”</p>

<p>“What thing&mdash;the pun?”</p>

<p>“The toothache.”</p>

<p>“It caught me,” said Stephen resentfully.</p>

<p>“Then it caught you in some of
those villanous cut-throat places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
where you go pottering after beggars
and blackguards and the Lord
knows what!” said Marmaduke with
airy contempt, drawing his slim, beringed
fingers gracefully through a
mass of remarkably fine curls that
clustered over his high, white forehead,
and gave a boyish look to his
handsome young face, and added
to its attractions. He was
extremely prepossessing, this perfumed,
patent-leather-booted young
gentleman of two-and-twenty. You
could not look at him without
liking him. His eye was as clear
as a child’s, his smile as frank,
his laughter as joyous and catching.
Yet, as it sometimes happens
with the graces of childhood, these
things were a deceptive promise.
The frankness and the joy were
genuine; but there was a cold
gleam of contempt, a cold ring of
selfishness, in the bright eyes and
the merry voice that were very disappointing
when you found them
out. But people were slow to find
them out. Even those who lived
with Marmaduke, and thus had
ample opportunities of judging,
remained under the spell of his
attractive manners and personal
charms until some accident revealed
their worthlessness. A false coin
will go on passing current through
many hands, until one day some
one drops it to the ground, and the
glittering sham is betrayed. He
had not a bad heart; he was kind
even, when he could be brought to
forget himself for a moment and
think of others. But it required a
shock to do this; and shocks are,
happily, rare in every-day life. So
Marmaduke slept on undisturbed
in his egotism, hardening unconsciously
in self-absorbed enjoyment.
He had never taken trouble
about anything, made a genuine
effort of any sort except for his
amusement. He had just the kind
of brains to enable him to get
through college with a decent
amount of success easily&mdash;tact,
ready repartee, a quick, retentive
memory that gave the maximum of
result for the minimum of work.
He would pass for clever and well
informed where an awkward, ugly
youth, who had ten times his intellect
and studied ten times harder,
would pass for knowing nothing.
Stephen was eight years older than
he, and had not yet discovered
his brother’s real value. Perhaps
this arose partly from Stephen’s
not being of a particularly observant
or analytical turn of mind.
He took people pretty much at
their own valuation, as the world is
rather apt to do. Marmaduke set
a very high price on his handsome
face and limited attainments, and
his brother had never dreamed of
disputing it. He would sometimes
naïvely express his surprise that
people were so fond of Duke when
he did so little to please them;
and wonder how popular he was,
considering that he never gave
himself the smallest trouble to
oblige or humor people.</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s his handsome face
that mankind, and womankind in
particular, find so taking,” Stephen
would remark to Nelly. “He certainly
has a wonderful knack for
getting on with people without caring
twopence whether they like him
or not. I wish I knew his secret.
Perhaps it’s his high spirits.”</p>

<p>Nelly would sometimes suggest
that Marmaduke’s fine temper
might count for something in the
mystery. And Stephen never contradicted
her. His temper was not
his best point. He had a heart of
gold; he had energy, patience, and
endurance to any extent&mdash;except
in case of toothache; he was unselfish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
and generous; but he was
sensitive and exacting. Like most
persons who dispense liberally, he
was impatient of the selfishness and
ingratitude of men who take all
they can get and return nothing.
Marmaduke had no such accounts
to square with human beings, so he
never felt aggrieved, never quarrelled
with them. Stephen was working
hard at his profession&mdash;he was
an engineer&mdash;and so far he had
achieved but moderate success.
Marmaduke had been called to the
bar, but it was a mere formality so
far; he spent his time dawdling
about town, retailing gossip and
reading poetry, waiting for briefs that
never came&mdash;that never do come
to handsome young gentlemen who
take it so easy. His elder brother
laid no blame on him for this
want of success. He was busy all
day himself, and took for granted
that Marmaduke was busy on his
side. The law was up-hill work,
besides; the cleverest and most
industrious men grew gray in its
service before they made a name
for themselves; and Duke was
after all but a boy&mdash;he had time
enough before him. So Stephen
argued in his brotherly indulgence,
in ignorance of the real state of
things.</p>

<p>Nelly was, as yet, the only person
who had found out Marmaduke, who
knew him thoroughly. She knew
him egotistical to the core, averse
to work, to effort of every sort, idle,
self-indulgent, extravagant; and the
knowledge of all this afforded
much anxious thought to her little
head of nineteen years. They
lived alone, these three. Nelly was
a mother to the two young men,
watching and caring for them with
that instinctive child-motherhood
that is so touching in young girls
sometimes. She was a spirited,
elfin little creature, very pretty,
blessed with the sweetest of tempers,
the shrewdest of common
sense, and an energy of character
that nothing daunted and few
things resisted. Marmaduke described
this trait of Nelly’s in brother-like
fashion as “a will of her
own.” He knew his was no match
for it, and, with a tact which made
one of his best weapons of defence,
he contrived to avoid clashing with
it. This was not all policy. He
loved his pretty sister, and admired
her more than anything in the
world except himself. And yet he
knew that this admiration was not
mutual; that Nelly knew him thoroughly,
saw through him as if he
were glass; but he was not afraid
of her. His elder brother was
duped by him; but he would have
staked his life on it that Nelly
would never undeceive him; that
she would let Stephen go on believing
in him so long as the deceiver
himself did not tear off the
mask. Yet it was a source of bitter
anxiety to the wise little mother-maiden
to watch Marmy drifting
on in this life of indolence and
vacuity. Where was it to end?
Where do such lives always end?
Nothing but some terrible shock
could awake him from it. And
where was the shock to come from?
Nelly never preached&mdash;she was far
too sensible for that&mdash;but when the
opportunity presented itself she
would say a few brief words to
the culprit in an earnest way that
never irritated him, if they worked
no better result. He would admit
with exasperating good-humor that
he was a good-for-nothing dog; that
he was unworthy of such a perfection
of a sister and such an irreproachable
elder brother; but that,
as nature had so blessed him, he
meant to take advantage of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
privilege of leaving the care of his
perfection to them.</p>

<p>“If I were alone on my own
hook, Nell, I would work like a
galley-slave,” he protested once to
her gentle upbraiding. “But as it
is, why need I bother myself?
You will save my soul, and pray
me high and dry into heaven; and
Stephen&mdash;Stephen the admirable,
the unimpeachable, the pink of respectability&mdash;will
keep me out of
mischief in this.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe in vicarious salvation
for this world or the next,
and neither do you, Marmy. You
are much too intelligent to believe
in any such absurdity,” replied
Nelly, handing him a glove she had
been sewing a button into.</p>

<p>Marmaduke did not contradict
her, but, whistling an air from the
<cite>Trovatore</cite>, arranged his hat becomingly,
a little to one side, and,
with a farewell look in the glass
over the mantel-piece, sauntered
out for his morning constitutional
in the park. Nelly went to the
window, and watched the lithe
young figure, with its elastic step,
until it disappeared. She was conscious
of a stronger solicitude about
Marmaduke this morning than she
had ever felt before. It was like
a presentiment. Yet there was nothing
that she knew of to justify it.
He had not taken to more irregular
hours, nor more extravagant habits,
nor done anything to cause her
fresh anxiety; still, her heart beat
as under some new and sudden
fear. Perhaps it was the ring of
false logic in his argument that
sounded a louder note of alarm and
warned her of worse danger than
she had suspected. One might
fear everything for a man starting
in life with the deliberate purpose
of shifting his responsibility on to
another, setting his conscience to
sleep because he had two brave,
wakeful ones watching at his side.</p>

<p>“If something would but come
and wake him up to see the monstrous
folly, the sinfulness, of it!”
sighed Nelly. “But nothing short
of a miracle could do that, I believe.
He might, indeed, fall ill
and be brought to death’s door; he
might break his leg and be a cripple
for life, and that might serve the
purpose; but oh! dear, I’m not
brave enough to wish for so severe
a remedy.”</p>

<p>Two months had passed since
this little incident between the brother
and sister, and nothing had occurred
to vindicate Nelly’s gloomy
forebodings. Marmaduke rose late,
read the newspaper, then Tennyson,
Lamartine, or the last novel, made
an elaborate toilet, and sauntered
down to the courts to keep a lookout
for the coming briefs. But it
was near Christmas now, and this
serious and even tenor of life had
been of late broken in upon by the
getting up of private theatricals
in company with some bachelor
friends. What between learning
his own part, and hearing his fellow-actors
and actresses theirs, and
overseeing stage arrangements, Marmaduke
had a hard time of it. His
hands were full; he was less at home
than usual, seldom or never of an
evening. He had come in very
late some nights, and looked worn
and out of spirits, Nelly thought,
when he came down to his late
breakfast.</p>

<p>“I wish those theatricals were
over, Marmy. They will kill you
if they last much longer,” she said,
with a tender, anxious look on her
pretty little face. This was the
day he came home and found Stephen
in the hands of the Philistines.</p>

<p>“’Tis hard work enough,” assented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
the young man, stretching
out his long limbs wearily; “but
the 26th will soon be here. It will
be too bad if you are laid up and
can’t come and applaud me, Steevy,”
he added, considering his elder
brother’s huge head, that looked as
if it would take a month to regain
its natural shape.</p>

<p>“Humph! That’s the least of
my troubles!” boomed Stephen
through his poultice.</p>

<p>“Civil! Eh, Nell? I can tell
you it’s as bad as any toothache,
the labor I’ve had with the business&mdash;those
lazy dogs, Travers and
Milford, throwing all the weight of it
on me, under pretext of never having
done that sort of thing before.”</p>

<p>“That’s always the fate of the
willing horse,” said Stephen, without
the faintest idea of being sarcastic.
“That’s just what I complain
of with those idle fellows X&mdash;&mdash;
and W&mdash;&mdash;; they throw the burden
of all the business on me, because,
forsooth, I understand things
better! I do understand that people
can’t get work done unless they
bestir themselves and attend to
it.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be such an ass as to
let myself be put on in that way,”
said Marmaduke resentfully. “I
would not be fooled into doing the
work of three people instead of
one.”</p>

<p>“And yet that’s what you are
doing at present,” replied Stephen.</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s different; it is only
<i lang="fr">en passant</i>,” explained Marmaduke;
“and then, you see, it.…”</p>

<p>“Amuses you,” Nelly had it on
the tip of her tongue to say; but
she checked herself, and finished
the sentence for him with, “It is
not the same thing; people cannot
make terms for a division of labor,
except it be in the case of real business.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” assented Stephen.
Marmaduke looked at his
boots, and inwardly voted Nelly
“no end of a trump.”</p>

<p>Did she guess this mental vote,
and did she take advantage of it to
ask him a favor?</p>

<p>“Perhaps Marmy would go and
see that poor man for you, Stephen?”
she said in the most natural
way possible, without looking up
from her work.</p>

<p>“I wish he would; I should be
ever so much obliged to him.
Would you mind it, Duke?”</p>

<p>“Mind what?”</p>

<p>“Taking a message for me to a
poor fellow that I wanted badly to
go and see to-day.”</p>

<p>“Who is he? Where does he
hang out?”</p>

<p>“His name is John Baines, and
he hangs out in Red Pepper Lane,
ten minutes from here, at the back
of the square.”</p>

<p>“Some abominable slum, no
doubt.”</p>

<p>“The locality is not Berkeley
Square or Piccadilly, but it would
not kill you to walk through it
once,” rejoined Stephen.</p>

<p>“Do go, there’s a dear boy!”
coaxed Nelly, fixing her bright eyes
on Marmaduke’s face, with a smile
that would have fascinated a gorilla.</p>

<p>Marmaduke rose, stretched his
arms, as if to brace himself for an
effort.</p>

<p>“Who’s your friend John
Baines?” he said. “A ticket-of-leave
man?”</p>

<p>“Nothing so interesting; he’s
only a rag-and-bone man.”</p>

<p>Marmaduke said nothing, but his
nose uttered such an unmistakable
<em>pshaw!</em> that Nelly, in spite of herself,
burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“What the deuce can make him
cultivate such company?” he exclaimed,
appealing to Nelly, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
joining good-humoredly in her
merriment.</p>

<p>“To help them and do them
good; what else?” she replied.</p>

<p>“Every man to his taste; I confess
I have none for evangelizing
rag-and-bone men, or indeed men
of any station, kind, or degree,”
observed Marmaduke emphatically.</p>

<p>“Then you won’t go?” said
Stephen.</p>

<p>“I didn’t say I wouldn’t. I don’t
mind devoting myself for once to
oblige you. What’s your message
for John Baines? Not a leg of
mutton or a bottle of port? I
won’t bargain for carrying that sort
of article.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to carry anything
that will encumber you,” replied
the elder brother. “Tell him
I cannot get to see him to-day, and
why, and that I am very sorry for
it. Meantime, you can say I have
done his commission. See if he
wants anything, and, if so I will
send it at once.”</p>

<p>“What ails him?” enquired Marmaduke
with a sudden look of
alarm.</p>

<p>“Poverty: hunger, and cold, and
misery.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s all! I mean it’s not
a case of typhus or small-pox. I
should not care to imperil my valuable
life by running in the way of
that sort of thing,” observed Marmaduke.</p>

<p>“Have no fear. The complaint
is not catching,” replied his brother.
“Whatever good he may do
you, he’ll do you no harm.”</p>

<p>“Dear Marmy! it’s very good
of you!” whispered Nelly, as she
tripped down-stairs after the reluctant
messenger, and helped him on
with his fur coat in the hall.</p>

<p>“It’s not a bit good; it’s an infernal
bore, and I’m only doing it
to please you, Nell,” protested Marmaduke.
“What a fool’s errand it
is! I sha’n’t know from Adam what
to say to the man when I get
there. <em>What</em> am I to say to him?”</p>

<p>“Oh! anything,” suggested Nelly.
“Say you have come to see
him because Stephen is ill, and ask
him how he is. You’re never at a
loss for something to say, you know
that right well; and whatever you
say is sure to be right.”</p>

<p>“When I know who I’m talking
to; but I don’t know this interesting
party, or what topics of conversation
he particularly affects. He
won’t expect me to preach him a
sermon, eh?” And Marmaduke
faced round with a look of such
comical terror at the thought that
Nelly again burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“Heaven forbid! That’s the
last thing you need dream of,” she
cried. “He is much more likely to
preach to you.”</p>

<p>“Oh! indeed; but I didn’t bargain
for that. I would very much
rather be excused,” protested Marmaduke,
anything but reassured.</p>

<p>“You foolish boy! I mean that
he will preach to you as the poor
always do&mdash;by example; by their
patience, and their gratitude for the
least thing one does for them.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to do anything
for John Baines that I can see;
only bothering him with a visit
which he would very likely rather I
spared him.”</p>

<p>“You will give him Stephen’s
message,” suggested Nelly, “and
then let him talk. There is nothing
poor people enjoy so much as a
good listener. They are quite happy
when they can pour out their
grievances into a willing ear. The
sympathy of the rich is often a
greater comfort to the poor than
their alms.”</p>

<p>“Humph! That’s lucky, anyhow,”
grunted Marmaduke. “Well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
I’ll let the old gentleman have his
head; I’ll listen till he pulls up
of his own accord.” He had his
hand on the door-latch, when Stephen’s
muffled tones were heard
calling from the room above. Nelly
bounded up the stairs, and was
back in an instant.</p>

<p>“He says you are to give Baines
half a sovereign from him; he had
nearly forgotten it.”</p>

<p>“Where is it?” said Marmaduke,
holding out his hand.</p>

<p>“Stephen has not his purse about
him, so he begs you will give it for
him.”</p>

<p>“Neither have I mine,” said the
young man.</p>

<p>“Well, run up for it; or shall
I? Where is it?” inquired willing
Nelly.</p>

<p>Marmaduke hesitated for a moment,
and then said abruptly: “It
doesn’t matter where it is; there’s
nothing in it.”</p>

<p>“What have you done with your
money? You had plenty a few
days ago!” exclaimed Nelly in
childlike surprise.</p>

<p>“I have lost it; I haven’t a brass
farthing in the world!” He said
this in a reckless, dogged sort of
way, as if he did not care who
knew it; and yet he spoke in an undertone.
For one moment Nelly
looked at him in blank astonishment.</p>

<p>“Lost it?” she repeated, and
then, the truth flashing on her suddenly,
she cried in a frightened
whisper: “O Marmaduke! you
have not been gambling? Oh!
tell me it’s not true.” She caught
hold of his arm, and, clinging to it,
looked into his face, scared and
white.</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Nell! I thought you
were a girl of sense,” he exclaimed
pettishly, disengaging himself and
pushing back the bolt. “Let me be
off; tell Stephen I had not change,
so his friend must wait till he can
go and tip him himself.”</p>

<p>“No, no; he may be hungry,
poor man. Stay, I think I have ten
shillings here,” said Nelly; and she
pulled out her porte-monnaie, and
picked four half-crowns from the
promiscuous heap of smaller coins.
“Take these; I will tell Stephen
you will give the ten shillings.”</p>

<p>Her hand trembled as she dropped
the money into Marmaduke’s
pocket. He was about to resist;
but there was something peremptory,
a touch of that will of her own,
in her manner that deterred him.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry I said anything about
it; I should not if I thought you
would have minded it so much,” he
observed.</p>

<p>“Minded it? O Marmaduke!
Minded your taking to gambling?”</p>

<p>“Tush! Don’t talk nonsense!
A man isn’t a gambler because
once in a way he loses a twenty-pound
note.”</p>

<p>And with this he brushed past
her, and closed the hall-door with
a loud bang.</p>

<p>Nelly did not sit down on one of
the hall chairs and cry. She felt
mightily inclined to do so; but she
struggled against the weakness and
overcame it. Walking quietly up
the stairs, she hummed a few bars
of a favorite air as she passed the
door of Stephen’s sitting-room, and
went on to her own room on the
story above. But even here, safe
and alone, the tears were bravely
held back. She would not cry;
she would not be seen with red eyes
that would betray her brother; she
would do her very utmost to rescue
him, to screen him even now.
While she is wrestling and pleading
in the silence of her own room, let
us follow the gambler to Red Pepper
Lane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span></p>

<p>Marmaduke had described the
place accurately when he called it
an abominable slum. Red Pepper
Lane was one of those dismal, frightful
dens of darkness and dirt that
cower at the back of so many of our
wealthy squares and streets&mdash;poison-pits
for breeding typhus and every
social plague that desolates great
cities. The houses were so high
and the lane so narrow that you
could at a stretch have shaken
hands across from window to window.
There was a rope slung half-way
down the alley, with a lantern
hanging from it which looked more
like a decoration or a sign than a possible
luminary; for the glass was
too thickly crusted with dirt to admit
of the strongest light piercing it.
In the middle of the lane was a gutter,
in which a few ragged, begrimed,
and hungry-looking little mortals
were playing in the dirty snow.
The east wind whistled through the
dreary tenements with a sharp, pitiless
cry; the sky was bright outside,
but here in Red Pepper Lane its
brightness did not penetrate. Nothing
but the wind could enter,
and that came with all its might,
through the crannies in the walls,
through the rickety doors, through
the window-frames glazed with
brown paper or battered old hats&mdash;any
rag that could be spared to
stuff the empty panes. Not a head
was seen anywhere protruding from
windows or doors; the fierce blast
kept every one within who had a
roof to cover them. If it were not
for the sooty little objects disporting
themselves in the gutter, the
lane might have been the precincts
of the jail, so deserted and silent
was it. Marmaduke might have
wandered up and down for an hour
without meeting any one whom he
could ask to direct him to where
John Baines lived, but luckily he
recognized the house at once by
Stephen’s signal of an old broom
nailed over the door. He searched
for a knocker or a bell; but seeing
neither, he sounded a loud rat-ta-ta-tat
with the gold knob of his
walking-stick, and presently a voice
called out from somewhere to “lift
the latch!” He did so, and, again
left to his own devices, he followed
Stephen’s injunctions and went
straight up to the second story,
where he knocked, and in obedience
to a sharp “Come in!” entered.</p>

<p>The gloom of the lane had prepared
him gradually for the deeper
gloom of the room, and he at once
distinguished a person, whom he
rightly surmised to be the rag-and-bone
man, sitting at the farther end,
near the fire-place, wrapped up in
a brown blanket, with his feet resting
on the hearth-stone, as if he
were toasting them. If he was, it
was in imagination; for there was
no fire&mdash;only the ghost of one as
visible in a mass of gray ashes, and
they did not look as if even a glow
of the late warmth remained in
them. He had his back to the
door, and, when it opened, he turned
his head in that direction, but
not sufficiently to see who came in.
Marmaduke, as he stood on the
threshold, took in the surroundings
at a glance. There was a bed on
the floor in one corner, with no bed-clothes
to speak of, the blanket being
just now in requisition as a
cloak; a miserable-looking table
and two chairs&mdash;an unoccupied one
and the one Baines sat in; a bag
and a basket were flung under the
window, and some dingy old utensils&mdash;a
saucepan, kettle, etc.&mdash;lay
about. There was nothing particularly
dreadful in the scene; it was,
compared with many such, rather a
cheerful one on the whole; but
Marmaduke, who had no experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
of the dwellings of the poor, thought
it the most appalling picture of
misery and desolation that could
be conceived. He was roused
from the stupor of horror into
which the sudden spectacle had
thrown him by hearing the figure
in the blanket ask rather sharply a
second time “Who’s there?”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said Marmaduke,
advancing within a step of
the chair. “My name is Walpole; I
have come to see if there is anything
I can do for you&mdash;anything
that you … that …” he stammered,
not knowing how to put it.</p>

<p>“Oh! Mr. Walpole, I am obliged
to you for calling, sir. I want
nothing; but I am glad to see you.
It is very kind of you. Pray take a
chair. You must excuse me for not
getting up; my leg is still very painful.”</p>

<p>“I am only the brother of the
Mr. Walpole whom you know,” said
Marmaduke, surprised beyond measure
at the good address of the
man. “My brother is laid up with
a violent face-ache. He was greatly
put out at not being able to keep
his appointment with you this afternoon,
and sent me to see how you
were getting on, and to tell you he
had done something that you commissioned
him to do.”</p>

<p>“Your brother is extremely
kind,” said the man. “I am sorry
to hear he is ill. This weather is
trying to everybody.”</p>

<p>“You seem to be a severe sufferer
from it,” remarked Marmaduke.
He had opened his fur coat, and sat
back in the rickety chair, in mortal
fear all the while that it would
go to smash under him. This was
the most extraordinary specimen of
the rag-and-bone tribe&mdash;he could
not say that he had ever known,
for he had never known one in his
life, but&mdash;that he could have imagined.
He spoke like an educated
man, and, even in his blanket, he
had the bearing of a gentleman. If
it were not for his swollen nose and
the glare of his red eye-balls, which
were decidedly not refined, there
was nothing in his appearance to
indicate that he belonged to the
very dregs of human society. It
was impossible to say how old he
was, but you saw at a glance that
he was more broken than aged.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am suffering rather
severely just now,” he replied in a
quiet, conversational way; “I always
do when the cold sets in. But,
added to my chronic complaint of
sciatica, I slipped on the ice some
time ago, and sprained my left foot
badly. Your brother made my acquaintance
at the hospital where I
was taken to have it set right.”</p>

<p>“And has it been set right?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I can’t get about easily
yet, but it will be all right by and
by.” And then, dismissing the
selfish subject, he said: “I am distressed,
sir, that you should have
had the trouble of coming to such
a place as this; pray don’t let me
detain you longer.”</p>

<p>“I’m in no hurry,” replied Marmaduke,
whose interest and curiosity
were more and more excited.
“Is there nothing I can do for you?
It’s dismal work sitting here all day
with a sprained ankle, and having
nothing to do; would you care to
have some books?” It did not
occur to him to ask if he knew how
to read; he would as soon have inquired
if he knew how to speak.</p>

<p>Baines looked at him with a curious
expression.</p>

<p>“I don’t look like a man to lend
books to, do I?” he said. “There’s
not much in common between
books and a rag-and-bone man.”</p>

<p>“Quite as much, I should say, as
there is between some men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
rags and bones,” retorted Marmaduke,
meeting the man’s eyes with a
responsive question in his own.</p>

<p>Baines turned away with a short
laugh. Perhaps it was mere accident
or the force of habit that
made him look up at the space over
the mantel-piece; but there was
something in the deliberate glance
that made Marmaduke follow it,
and, doing so, he saw a faded but
originally good engraving of Shakspere
hung in a frame against the
wall. Repressing the low whistle
which rose involuntarily to his lips,
he said, looking at the portrait:</p>

<p>“You have a likeness of Shakspere,
I see. Have you read his
plays?”</p>

<p>“Ay, and acted them!”</p>

<p>“Acted them! You were originally
on the stage, then? I saw at
once that you were not what you
seem to me,” said Marmaduke, with
that frankness that seemed so full
of sympathy and was so misleading,
though never less so, perhaps,
than at this moment. “Would it be
disagreeable to you to tell me
through what chapters of ill-luck
or other vicissitudes you came to
be in the position where I now see
you?”</p>

<p>The man was silent for a few
minutes; whether he was too deeply
offended to reply at once, or
whether he was glancing over the
past which the question evoked, it
was impossible to say. Marmaduke
fancied he was offended, and,
vexed with himself for having questioned
him, he stood up, and laying
Nelly’s four half-crowns on the
chimney-piece, “I beg your pardon
if I seemed impertinent; I assure
you I did not mean it,” he said. “I
felt interested in you, and curious
to know something more of you;
but I had no right to put questions.
Good-morning.” He made a step
towards the door, but Baines, rousing
himself, arrested him by a sign.</p>

<p>“I am not offended,” he said.
“I saw quite well what made you
ask it. You would have every
right to catechise me if I had
come to you for help; as it is, your
kindness and your brother’s makes
a claim which I am in no mind to
dispute. If you don’t mind shivering
in this cold place for half an
hour, pray sit down, and I will tell
you my story. I have not a cigar
to offer you,” he added with a
laugh, “but perhaps you don’t affect
that vice?”</p>

<p>“I do indeed very considerably,”
said Marmaduke, and, pulling
out a handsome cigar-case, he
handed it to Baines, and invited
him to help himself; the rag-man
hesitated just for a moment, and
then, yielding to the instinct of his
good-breeding, took one.</p>

<p>“It’s not an amusing story,” he
began, when they had sent up a
few warm puffs from their fragrant
weeds, “but it may not be uninteresting
to you. You are very
young; would it be rude to ask
how young?”</p>

<p>“Two-and-twenty next week, if
I live so long,” replied Marmaduke.</p>

<p>“Humph! I was just that age
when I took the fatal turn in the
road that led to the honorable career
in which I am now embarked.
My father was an officer in the line.
He had no fortune to speak of; a
couple of thousand pounds left
him by an aunt was all the capital
he possessed. When he was still
young, he married, and got three
thousand pounds with his wife. I
was their only child. My father
died when I was ten years old, and
left me to the sole care of my
mother, who made an idol of me
and spoiled me to my heart’s content.
I was not a bad boy, I had no evil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
propensities, and I was not deficient
in brains. I picked up things
with little or no effort, and got on
better at school than many who
had twice the brains and four
times the industry. I was passionately
fond of poetry, learned pages
of Byron and Shelley by heart, and
declaimed with a good deal of
power. There could not have
been a greater curse than such a
gift to a boy of my temperament
and circumstances. When I left
school, I went to Oxford. My poor
mother strained every nerve to give
me a university education, with a
view to my becoming a barrister;
but instead of repaying her sacrifices
by working hard, I spent the
greater part of my time acting. I
became infatuated about Shakspere,
and took to private theatricals with
a frenzy of enthusiasm. As ill-luck
would have it, I fell in with a
set of fellows who were drama-mad
like myself. I had one great chum
named Hallam, who was stark mad
about it, and encouraged me in the
folly to the utmost. I soon became
a leading star in this line. I was
sought for and asked out by everybody
in the place, until my head
got completely turned, and I fancied
I had only to walk on to the
stage to take Macready’s place and
achieve fame and fortune. The
first thing that roused me from the
absurd delusion was seeing Charles
Kean in Macbeth. I felt utterly
annihilated under the superiority
of his acting; it showed me in an
instant the difference there is between
ordinary taste and talent
and the divine afflatus of genius.
And yet an old friend who happened
to meet me in the theatre that
night assured me that the younger
Kean was not a patch upon his
father, and that Macready outshone
the elder Kean. I went
back to Oxford a crestfallen man,
and for a time took refuge from my
disappointment in real work. I
studied hard, and, when the term
came for going up for my degree,
I was confident of success. It was
a vain confidence, of course. I
had only given myself to study for
a period of two months or so, and
it would have been little short of
a miracle if I had passed. My
mother was terribly disappointed;
the sight of her tears cut me up
more than the failure on my own
account, and I determined to succeed
or die in the effort, if she consented
to let me make one more.
She did consent, and I succeeded.
That was the happiest day of my
life, I think.” He drew a long
breath, and repeated in an undertone,
as if he forgot Marmaduke’s
presence, and were speaking aloud
to himself: “Yes, the happiest day
of my life!”</p>

<p>“You worked very hard to pull
up for lost time!” observed Marmaduke.</p>

<p>“Lost time! Yes, that was it&mdash;lost
time!” said Baines, musing;
then he continued in his former tone:
“My poor mother was very happy.
She declared I had repaid her amply
for all her sacrifices. She saw me
already at the top of my profession,
a Q.C., a judge, the chief of all the
judges, seated in robes on the woolsack.
I came home, and was in
due time called to the bar. I was
then just twenty-four. We lived
in a pretty house on the road to
Putney; but my mother thought it
now desirable to move into London,
that I might have an office in
some central neighborhood, where
my clients would flow in and out
conveniently. I remember that I
strongly opposed the plan, not from
dislike, but from some feeling like
a presentiment, a dread, that London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
would be a dangerous place
for me, and that I was taking the
road to ruin by leaving the shelter
of our secluded home, with its garden
and trees, away from a thousand
temptations that beset a young
man in the great city. But my
mother’s heart was set on it. She
was convinced my character had
thoroughly changed, that I had
broken off for ever from old habits
and old propensities, and that I
was strong enough to encounter
any amount of temptation without
risk. Poor mother! It was no
fault of hers if she was blinded by
love. The fault was all mine. I
fed her with false hopes, and then
I betrayed them. She gave in so
far to my wishes as to consent only
to let the house, instead of selling
it, as she first intended; so that our
removal to London took the appearance
more of an essay than
a permanent arrangement. I was
thankful for this, and set about
the change in high spirits. We
were soon comfortably settled in a
very small house in Wimpole Street.
I found it rather like a bird-cage
after our airy, roomy abode in the
suburbs; but it was very snug, and
my mother, who had wonderful
taste, soon made it bright and pretty.
She was the brightest and prettiest
thing in it herself; people used
to take her for my elder sister when
she took me to parties of an evening.
I was very proud of her, and
with better reason than she was of
me.”</p>

<p>He paused again, looking up at
the Shakspere print, as if he saw
his mother’s likeness there. The
sunken, red eyes moistened as he
gazed on it.</p>

<p>“It is a great blessing to have
a good mother,” said Marmaduke.
“I lost mine when I was little more
than a child.”</p>

<p>“So much the better for both of
you,” retorted Baines bitterly; “she
did not live for you to break her
heart, and then eat out your own
with remorse. But I am talking
wildly. You would no doubt have
been a blessing to her; you would
have worked like a man, and she
would have been proud of you to
the end. It was not so with me. I
was never fond of work. I was not
fond of it then; indeed, what I did
was not worthy of being called work
at all. I moped over a law-book
for an hour or so in the morning,
and then read Shakspere or some
other favorite poet, by way of refreshing
myself after the unpalatable
task, and getting it out of my
head as quickly as possible. I went
down regularly to the courts; but as
I had no legal connection, and nothing
in myself to make up for the
want of patronage, or inspire confidence
in my steadiness and abilities,
the attorneys brought me no
business; and as I was too lazy,
and perhaps too proud, to stoop to
court them, I began to feel thoroughly
disgusted with the profession,
and to wish I had never entered
it. I ceased to go through
the farce of my law-reading of a
morning, and devoted myself entirely
to my dilettante tastes, reading
poetry, and occasionally amusing
myself with writing it. My old
longing for the stage came back,
and only wanted an opportunity to
break out actively. This opportunity
was not far off. My mother
suspected nothing of the way I was
idling my time; she knew the bar
was up-hill work, and was satisfied
to see me kept waiting a few years
before I became famous; but it was
matter of surprise to her that I
never got a brief of any description.
She set it down to jealousy
on the part of my rivals at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
courts, and would now and then
wax wroth against them, wondering
what expedient could be devised
for showing up the corrupt state of
the profession, and forcing my enemies
to recognize my superiority as
it deserved. Don’t laugh at her
and think her a fool; she was wise
on every subject but this, and I
fear I must have counted for something
in leading her to such ridiculous
conclusions. I held very
much to preserving her good opinion,
but, instead of striving to justify
it by working on to the fulfilment
of her motherly ambition, I took
to cheating her, first tacitly, then
deliberately and cruelly. Things
were going on in this way, when
one day, one ill-fated day, I went
out as usual in the afternoon, ostensibly
to the courts, but really to
kill time where I could&mdash;at my club,
in the Row, or lounging in Pall
Mall. I was passing the Army and
Navy Club, when I heard a voice
call out:</p>

<p>“‘Halloo, Hamlet!’ (This was
the name I went by at Oxford, on
account of my success in the part.)
‘How glad I am to see you, old boy!
You’re the very man I’ve been on
the look-out for.’</p>

<p>“‘Hallam!’ I cried, returning
his friendly grasp, and declaring
how delighted I was to see him.</p>

<p>“‘I’ve been beating about for
you ever since I came to town, ten
days ago,’ he said. ‘I wrote to your
old address, but the letter was sent
back to me. Where have you migrated
to; and what are you doing?’</p>

<p>“I told him the brief history of
my existence since we had parted
at Oxford, he to enter the army, I
to begin my course of dinners-eating
at the Temple. He was now on
leave; he had just come from the
north, where his regiment was quartered,
and he was in high spirits at
the prospect of his month’s holiday.
I asked him what it was he had
been wanting me so particularly
for.</p>

<p>“‘I wanted to see you, first of all,
for your own sake, old boy,’ he answered
heartily; ‘and in the next
place I want you badly to help us
to get up some private theatricals
at the Duchess of B&mdash;&mdash;’s after
Easter. I suppose you are a perfect
actor&mdash;a Garrick and Charles
Mathews combined&mdash;by this time.
You have had plenty of practice, I’ll
be bound.’</p>

<p>“I assured him that I had not
played since the last time he and I
had brought down the house together.
He was immensely surprised,
and loudly deplored my mistake
in burying such a talent in the
earth. He called me a conceited
idiot to have let myself be crushed
by Kean, and vowed a year’s training
from a professional would bring
me out a better actor than ever
Kean was. Amateur acting was all
very well, but the finest untaught
genius ever born could no more
compete successfully with a man
who had gone through the regular
professional drill than a civilian
could with a trained soldier in executing
a military manœuvre.</p>

<p>“‘I told you before, and I tell
you again,’ he continued, as arm in
arm we paced a shady alley of the
park&mdash;‘I tell you that if you went
on the stage you would cut out the
best actor we have; though that is
not saying much, for a more miserable,
ignorant lot of drivelling idiots
no stage ever saw caricaturing the
drama than our English theatres
can boast at this moment.’</p>

<p>“My heart rose high, and my
vanity swelled out like a peacock’s
tail, pluming itself in this luxurious
air of flattery. I knew Hallam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
meant what he said; but I knew
that he was a light-headed young
fellow, not at all competent to judge
dramatic power, and still less to
counsel me. Yet such is the intoxicating
effect of vanity that I
swallowed his praise as if it had
been the purest wisdom. I opened
my whole heart to him, told him
how insufferably bored I was at the
bar, that I had no aptitude for it,
that I was wasting my time waiting
for briefs that never came&mdash;I did
not explain what pains I took to
prevent their coming&mdash;until, kindling
with my own exaggerated statement
as I went on, I ended by cursing
the day I took to the bar, and
declaring that if it were not for my
mother I would abandon the whole
thing and try my luck on the stage
to-morrow.</p>

<p>“‘And why should you let your
mother stand in your way?’ said
Hallam. ‘If she is too unreasonable
to see the justice of the case,
why, then … well, I can’t for the
life of me see why your happiness
and fortune should be sacrificed to
it.’</p>

<p>“He was not a bad fellow&mdash;far
from it. He did not mean to play
the devil’s advocate. I am certain
he thought he was giving me excellent
advice, using his superior
knowledge of the world for my
benefit. But he was a fool&mdash;an ignorant,
silly, well-meaning fool.
Such men, as friends, are often
worse than knaves. If he had proposed
anything obviously wicked,
dishonest, or unprincipled, I should
have scouted it indignantly, and
walked off in contempt. But he
argued with a show of reason, in a
tone of considerate regard for my
mother’s wishes and feelings that
deceived and disarmed me. He
represented to me the folly of sticking
to a life that I hated and that I
had next to no chance of ever succeeding
in; he had a score of examples
at his fingers’ ends of young
fellows teeming with talent, patient
as asses, and hard working as
negroes, who had gone for the bar
and given it up in despair. My
mother, like all fond mothers, naturally
expected me to prove an exception
to the general rule, and to
turn out a lord chancellor of the
romantic sort, rising by sheer force
of merit, without patronage, without
money, without any of the essential
helps, by the power of my
unaided genius. ‘This is simply
bosh, my dear fellow&mdash;innocent maternal
bosh,’ persisted Hallam, ‘but
as dangerous as any poison. Cut the
bar, as your better genius prompts
you to do, and take to your true
calling&mdash;the drama.’</p>

<p>“‘For aught I know, I may have
lost any talent I had,’ I replied;
‘it is two years, remember, since I
acted at all.’</p>

<p>“‘That is very easily ascertained,’
said my friend. ‘You will take
a part in these theatricals we are
going to get up, and we will soon
see whether your talent has evaporated
or not. My own impression
is that it will come out stronger
than ever; you have studied, and
you have seen something, if not
very much, of life since your last
attempts.’</p>

<p>“‘My mother has a horror of the
theatre,’ I said, unwilling to yield
without a show of resistance; ‘it
would break her heart to see me
take to the stage.’</p>

<p>“‘Not if you succeed; hearts
are never broken by success.’</p>

<p>“‘And how if I fail?’</p>

<p>“‘You are sure not to fail,’ he
urged. ‘But look here: do nothing
rashly. Don’t say anything about
this business until you have tried
your hand at it in private. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
have not settled yet what the play
is to be; they left it to me to select,
and I will choose one that will
bring out your powers best&mdash;not
tragedy; that never was your line, in
my opinion. At any rate, you must
for the present confine yourself to
light parts, such as.…’</p>

<p>“I interrupted him in high dudgeon.</p>

<p>“‘Why, if I’m not tragic, I’m
nothing!’ I exclaimed. ‘Every
one who ever saw me in Hamlet
declared they had never seen the
part so well rendered! And you
said many a time that my Macbeth
was.…’</p>

<p>“‘First-rate&mdash;for an amateur;
and I will say it again, if you like,’
protested Hallam; ‘but since then,
I have seen real acting.…’</p>

<p>“‘Then mine was not real? I
can’t for the life of me see, then
…’ I broke in.</p>

<p>“‘Don’t get so infernally huffy,’
said Hallam, shaking my arm with
good-humored impatience. ‘If
you want to know what real, trained,
professional acting is, you must go
abroad, and see how the actors of
the Théâtre Français, for instance,
study and train and drill. If you
will start with the English notion
that a man can take to the stage as
he does to the saddle, give up the
plan at once; you will never rise
above an amateur. But to come
back to our present purpose; we
will select a part to suit you, and
if the rehearsals promise a genuine
success&mdash;as I have not a doubt they
will&mdash;we will invite your mother to
come and see you, and she will be
so proud of your triumph that the
cause will be won.’</p>

<p>“‘My dear Hallam, it was some
good fairy sent you in my way
assuredly this morning!’ I cried,
grasping his arm in delight.</p>

<p>“I was highly elated, and took to
the scheme with enthusiasm. We
spent the afternoon discussing it.
It was settled that the play should
be <cite>The Taming of the Shrew</cite>; the
part of Benedict would suit me to
perfection, Hallam declared, and I
was so subdued by the amount of
worldly wisdom and general knowledge
of life which he had displayed
in his arguments about my change
of profession that I yielded without
difficulty, and consented to forego
tragedy for the present.</p>

<p>“For the next week I was in a
whirl of excitement. He took me
to the Army and Navy Club, and
introduced me to a number of
swells, all military men, who were
very agreeable and treated me with
a soldier-like cordiality that charmed
me. I fancied life must be a delightful
thing in such pleasant,
good-natured, well-bred company;
that I was now in my proper sphere;
and that I had been hitherto out
of place amidst rusty lawyers and
hard-working clerks, etc. In fact,
I was a fool, and my head got turned.
I spent all my time in the day
lounging about with Hallam and
his aristocratic captains and colonels,
and the evenings I devoted to
the business of rehearsal, which
was carried on at Lady Arabella
Daucer’s, the married daughter of
the duchess at whose house the
theatricals were to be performed.
I had been very graciously received
by her grace, and consequently all
the lords and ladies who composed
her court followed suit. I was
made as much of as if I had been
‘one of them,’ and my acting soon
established me as the leading star
of the select company. I suppose
Hallam was right in saying that
more mature reading and so on had
improved my dramatic talent; for
certainly it came out with a brilliancy
that surprised myself. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
artistic, high-bred atmosphere that
surrounded me seemed to infuse
fresh vigor into me. I borrowed or
revealed a power that even my
vanity had never suspected. Hallam
was enchanted, and as proud
of my success as if it had been his
own.</p>

<p>“‘I can fancy how your mother
will enjoy this!’ he exclaimed one
evening, as I walked home with him
to his chambers in Piccadilly. ‘She
will be beside herself with pride in
you, old fellow. Fancy what it will
be the night of your first public
representation! I expect a seat in
her box, mind!’</p>

<p>“It was just two days before the
grand night, and we were having
our last rehearsal&mdash;the final one&mdash;in
the theatre at B&mdash;&mdash; House, which
was lighted up and filled with a select
few, in order to judge of the
general effect for the following
night. I was in great spirits, and
acted better than I had done yet.
The audience applauded warmly,
the ladies clapping their white-kid
hands and shaking their handkerchiefs,
that filled the air with the
perfumes of Arabia, while the gentlemen,
more audible in their demonstrations,
cheered loudly.</p>

<p>“When it was over, we sat down
to supper, about a hundred, of us.
I sat next the duchess, and my
beautiful Katharina on the other
side of me. She was a lovely girl
of twenty, a cousin of the duchess.
I had been struck by her beauty at
the first, but the more I saw of her
the less she pleased me; she was a
vain, coquettish young lady, and
only tolerated me because I was
useful as a good set-off to her acting,
which, to be just, was excellent.
I never saw anything so good off
the stage, and very seldom saw it
equalled even there. Flushed with
her recent triumph, which had borrowed
additional lustre from mine
she was more gracious and conversational
than I had yet known her.
I was flattered, though I knew perfectly
how much the caprice was
worth, and I exerted myself to the
utmost to be agreeable. We were
altogether a very merry party; the
champagne flowed freely, and with
it the spirits of the guests rose to
sparkling point. As we rose from
the table, some one called out for a
dance before we broke up. The
musicians had gone to have refreshments
after the rehearsal, but they
were still in the house. The duchess,
a good-natured, easy-going person,
who always agreed with everybody
all round, at once ordered them in;
people began to engage partners,
and all was laughing confusion
round the supper-table. I turned
to my pretty neighbor, and asked
if she was engaged; she replied,
laughing, that being neither a sibyl
nor a clairvoyant, she could not
have known beforehand that there
was to be dancing. ‘Then may I
have the honor of claiming you for
the first dance, whatever it may
be?’ I said; and she replied that I
might. I offered her my arm, and
we took our way back into the
theatre, which was still brilliantly
illuminated. We were to dance on
the stage. As we were pushing on
with the crowd, I felt a strong
hand laid on my arm, and, before I
had time to prevent it, Lady Caroline’s
hand was withdrawn, and the
intruder stood between us. He
was a square-built, distinguished-looking
man, not very young, but
handsome and with the <i lang="fr">beau</i> stamped
all over him.</p>

<p>“‘Excuse my want of ceremony,’
he said in an easy, supercilious
tone to me. ‘I claim the first
dance with Lady Caroline.’</p>

<p>“‘On what grounds?’ I demanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
stiffly. We were still moving on,
carried with the crowd, so it was
impossible to make him stand aside
or to regain my post next Lady
Caroline.</p>

<p>“‘On the grounds of her promise,’
he replied haughtily.</p>

<p>“Lady Caroline uttered a laughing
‘O Lord George!’ but did not
draw away the hand which he
had so unceremoniously transferred
from my arm to his.</p>

<p>“‘Lady Caroline made no engagement
before she came here to-night,’
I said, ‘and she promised
this dance to me. I refer you to
herself whether this be true or not.’</p>

<p>“‘Gentlemen are not in the habit
of catechising ladies as to their
behavior&mdash;not, at least, in our set;
and while you happen to be in it
you had better conform to its
customs,’ observed Lord George,
without looking towards me.</p>

<p>“I felt my blood boil so that it
was an effort not to strike him.
Two ladies near me who had heard
the passage between us cried,
‘Shame! No gentleman would have
said that!’ This gave me courage
to maintain my self-command. We
were now in the theatre; the orchestra
was playing a brilliant prelude
to a waltz, and Lord George,
as if he had forgotten all about me,
prepared to start. I laid my hand
peremptorily on his arm.</p>

<p>“‘In my set,’ I said, and my voice
shook with agitation, ‘gentlemen
don’t tolerate gratuitous impertinence;
you either make me an apology,
or I shall exact reparation of
another kind.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh! indeed. I shall be happy
to hear from you at your convenience,’
sneered Lord George, with
a low bow. He turned away, and
said in a voice loud enough to be
heard by me or any one else near,
‘The puppy imagines, I suppose,
that I would meet him in a duel.
The next thing will be we shall
have our footmen sending us challenges.
Capital joke, by Jove!
Come, we are losing time, Lady
Caroline! The waltz is half over.’</p>

<p>“They were starting this time,
when a voice behind me called out
imperiously: ‘A moment, Lord
George Halberdyne! The gentleman
whom you have insulted is a
friend of mine and a guest of the
Duchess of B&mdash;&mdash;; two conditions
that qualify him, I think, to be an
adversary of yours.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh! he’s a friend of yours,
is he?’ repeated Lord George, facing
around. ‘That’s a natural phenomenon
that I shall not stop to
investigate just now; but it certainly
puts this gentleman in a new
light. Good-evening, sir. I shall
have the pleasure, probably, of seeing
you to-morrow.’</p>

<p>“‘You shall, my lord,’ I replied;
and allowing Hallam to link my
arm in his and draw me away, I
turned my back on the brilliant
scene, and hurried out of the house,
feverish, humiliated, desperate.</p>

<p>“‘The idiot! The snob! You
shall give him a lesson that he’ll
not forget in a hurry,’ said Hallam,
who seemed nearly as indignant
and excited as myself. ‘Are you a
good shot? Have you ever stood
fire?’</p>

<p>“I answered both questions in
the negative. He was evidently
put out; but presently he said in a
confident tone:</p>

<p>“‘Well, it does not so much
matter; you are the offended party,
and consequently you have the
choice of weapons. It shall be
swords instead of pistols. I suppose
you’re a pretty good swordsman?’</p>

<p>“‘My dear Hallam,’ I said, ‘you
forget that these things are not in
my line at all. I never handled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
a sword since we flourished them
in the fencing hall at Oxford. In
fact, if the choice be mine, as you
say it is, I think I would do better
to choose pistols. I have a chance
with them; and if Lord George be
a swordsman, I have none with the
other.’</p>

<p>“Hallam seemed seriously disconcerted.</p>

<p>“‘It’s not quite such an affair of
chance as you appear to imagine,’
he said. ‘Halberdyne is one of the
best shots in the service; he never
misses his mark; and he is a first-rate
swordsman. ’Pon my honor I
don’t know what to advise you.’</p>

<p>“‘I must stand advised by myself
then, and here goes for pistols,’
I said, trying to put a bold face on
it, though I confess I felt anything
but cheerful at the prospect. ‘You
will stand by me, Hallam, will you
not?’</p>

<p>“‘Of course I will! I’ve committed
myself to as much already,’
he answered cordially; but I saw
he was uncomfortable. ‘I shall
take your card to the scoundrel
to-morrow morning. I wonder who
he’ll have for second&mdash;that bully
Roper, very likely,’ he went on,
talking more to himself than to me.</p>

<p>“‘Is the meeting to take place to-morrow
morning?’ I inquired; and
a sudden rush of anguish came on
me as I put the question. I
thought of my mother, of all that
might be in store for her so soon.</p>

<p>“‘We must try and put it off for
a day,’ said Hallam. ‘It is deucedly
awkward, you see, if it comes off
to-morrow, because of the play.
You may get hit, and it would be
a terrible business if you were <i lang="fr">hors
de concours</i> for the evening.’ There
was something so grimly comical
in the earnestness with which he
said this that, though I was in no
merry mood, I burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“‘A terrible business indeed!’ I
said. ‘How exceedingly unpleasant
for Lady Caroline particularly
to be left in the lurch on such an
occasion! However, if I go to the
wall, and Lord George comes off
safe, he might get up the part in a
hurry and replace me, eh?’ I had
hit the mark without knowing it.
It was jealousy that had provoked
Lord George to the gratuitous attack.
I suppose there was something
sardonic in my voice that
struck Hallam with the inappropriateness
of his previous remarks.
He suddenly stopped, and grasping
my arm warmly&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘I’m used to this sort of thing,
my dear fellow,’ he said; ‘but
don’t fancy from that that my feelings
are turned to stone, or that I
forget all that is, that may be, unpleasant
in the matter. But there
is no use talking of these things;
they unman a fellow, and he wants
all his nerves in working order at a
moment like this. Take my advice
and go home now, and cool
yourself by a quiet night for to-morrow’s
work, if it is to be to-morrow.
You may have some letters
to write or other things to attend
to, and they had better be
done at once.’</p>

<p>“I replied that I had no letters
to write and no business instructions
to leave. The idea of facing
my home, passing my mother’s door,
and then going to bed as if the world
had not turned right round; as if all
life, the present and the future, were
not revolutionized&mdash;this was what
I did not, at this moment at least,
feel equal to, and I said so.</p>

<p>“‘I would rather go for an hour
to the club,’ I said, ‘if you don’t
mind, and we will have a game of
billiards. I don’t feel inclined to
go home, and I should not sleep if
I went to bed.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Just as you like,’ he said;
‘but the night is so fine we may
as well take a few more turns in the
open air. It does one good after
those heated rooms.’</p>

<p>“It did me no good. I felt the
most miserable man in this miserable
world. I would have given
any happiness the world could have
offered me to undo this night’s
work, to be as I was an hour ago,
free, guiltless of projected murder
or suicide. I repeated to myself
that it was not my fault; that I had
been gratuitously provoked beyond
endurance; that as a gentleman I
could not have done otherwise;
but these sophistries neither calmed
nor strengthened me. Truer
voices rose up and answered them
in clear and imperious tones that
drowned the foolish comforters.
Why had I ever entered the society
where my position exposed
me to such results? What business
had I there? What good could
it do myself or any one else to
have been tolerated, even courted,
as I fancied I was, by these fine
people, who had nothing of any
sort in common with me? I had
forsaken my legitimate place, the
profession that my mother had
made such heavy sacrifices to open
to me. I had deliberately frittered
away my life, destroyed my prospects
of honorable success; and
this is what it had brought me to!
I was going either to shoot a man
who had done me no graver injury
than offend my pride and punish
my folly, or to be shot down by
him&mdash;and then? I saw myself
brought home to my mother dangerously
wounded, dead perhaps.
I heard her cry of agony, I saw
her mortal despair. I could have
cried out loud for pity of her. I
could have cursed myself for my
folly&mdash;for the mad, sinful folly that
had rewarded her by such an awakening.</p>

<p>“There is an electric current
that runs from mind to mind, communicating
almost like an articulate
voice the thoughts that are
passing within us at certain moments.
I had not spoken for several
minutes, as we paced up and
down Pall Mall, puffing our cigars
in the starlight; but this current I
speak of had passed from my brain
to Hallam’s, and informed him of
what my thoughts were busy on.</p>

<p>“‘Don’t let yourself down, old
boy,’ he said good-naturedly. ‘No
harm may come of it after all;
I’ve known a score of duels where
both sides came off with no more
than a pin-scratch, sometimes with
no scratch at all. Not that I suspect
you of being faint-hearted&mdash;I
remember what a dare-devil you
were at Oxford&mdash;but the bravest
of us may be a coward for others.’</p>

<p>“I felt something rise in my
throat as if it would choke me. I
could not get a word out.</p>

<p>“‘Who knows?’ continued Hallam
in his cheeriest tone; ‘you
may be bringing down the house
to-morrow night, and your mother
may be the proudest woman in
London, seeing you the king of the
company, cheered and complimented
by “fair women and brave
men!” I feel as sure of it, do you
know, as if I saw it in a glass.’</p>

<p>“He spoke in kindness, but the
levity of his tone, the utter hollowness
of his consolations, were intolerable.
They mocked my misery;
every word pierced me like a knife.
What evil genius had led me across
this man’s path? Only a few weeks
ago I said it was the work of an
angel, a good fairy, or some absurdity
of the sort. It was more
likely a demon that had done it. If
I had never met him, I said to myself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
I would never have known this
hour; I should have been an innocent
and a happy man. But this
would not do either. I was neither
innocent nor happy when I met
him. I was false to my duty, wasting
my life, and sick to death of
both; only longing for the opportunity
which Hallam had brought
me. If I had not met him, I should
have met or sought out some other
tempter, and bitten greedily at the
bait when it was offered. Still, I
felt embittered toward Hallam. I
accused him, as if he had been the
sole author of my misfortune; as if
I had been a baby or an idiot without
free-will or responsibility.</p>

<p>“‘Come into the club,’ I said,
dropping his arm and throwing
away the end of my cigar.</p>

<p>“He did not notice the impatient
movement, but readily crossed over,
and we entered the club. The lofty,
spacious rooms were blazing with
light and filled with groups of men.
Some were lounging on luxurious
couches, reading the evening papers,
some were chatting, some were
playing cards. An air of easy
grandeur, prosperity, and surface
happiness pervaded the place. I
felt horribly out of keeping with it
all. I had no business amongst
these wealthy, fashionable men; I
was like a skeleton stalking into the
feast. I believe it was nothing but
sheer human respect, the fear of
making myself ridiculous, that prevented
me from turning on my heel
and rushing straight out of the
house. I mechanically took up the
<cite>Globe</cite>, which a member tossed on to
a table near me, and sat down as if I
were going to read it.</p>

<p>“‘Leave that alone, and come into
the billiard-room,’ said Hallam.
And he whipped the paper out of my
hands with brotherly unceremoniousness.</p>

<p>“I rose and followed him like a
dog. I would have gone anywhere,
done anything, he or anybody else
suggested. Physically, I was indifferent
to what I did; my brain
on fire, I felt as if I were walking
in a dream.</p>

<p>“We were passing into the billiard-room
when a gentleman who was
seated at a card-table cried out to
Hallam to come and join them.
It was Col. Leveson, a brother officer
and great friend of his. Hallam
replied that he was going on
to have a pull at the balls; but
he strolled over to see how the
game was going. I mechanically
followed him. Some of the players
knew me, and greeted me with a
friendly nod. They were absorbed
in the game; it was lansquenet. I
knew very little about cards; but
lansquenet was the one game that
interested me. I had lost a few
sovereigns a night or two before at
it, and, as the luck seemed set in
against the banker, it flashed over
me I could not do better than to
take a hand and win them back
now. I did not, however, volunteer
to join the game. In my present
state of smarting pride I would
not run the risk of being made to
feel I was an intruder. Unluckily,
Hallam’s friend, reading temptation
on my countenance perhaps, said,
holding up his cards to me: “I’m in
splendid vein, but I must be off.
I’ll sell you my hand for half a sovereign,
if you like.”</p>

<p>“‘Done!’ I said; and paying the
half-sovereign, I sat down. I had
scarcely taken his place when there
was a noise in the adjoining room
announcing fresh arrivals. I recognized
one loud, domineering voice
above the others, and presently
Lord George Halberdyne came in.</p>

<p>“‘Going, Leveson?’ he said.
‘Luck against you, I suppose?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘On the contrary, never was in
better vein in my life,’ replied the
colonel. ‘I sold my hand for a
song, because I have an appointment
that I can’t forego.’</p>

<p>“‘Who’s the lucky dog you sold
it to?’ asked Lord George.</p>

<p>“‘Mr. Botfield,’ said Col. Leveson.
(My real name is Botfield; I
only took the name of Baines when
I fell into disgrace and misery.)</p>

<p>“Lord George muttered an exclamation
of some sort&mdash;whether of
surprise or vexation I could not
tell&mdash;and advanced to the table.</p>

<p>“‘Do you mind my joining you?’
he said, appealing to nobody in
particular. There was a general
assent, and he sat down. Hallam
would not take a hand. He hated
cards; his passion was for billiards,
and he played nothing else. He
came and stood behind me to
watch the game. I felt him lay
his hand on my shoulder, as if to
encourage me and remind me that
he was there to stand by me and
take my part against my late bully,
if needs be. It did not seem as if
he was likely to be called upon to
do so. My late bully was as gracious
as man could be&mdash;at least
he intended to be so; but I took
his familiar facetiousness for covert
impertinence, and it made my blood
boil quite as fiercely as his recent
open insult had done. I was not
man of the world enough to understand
that Lord George was only
doing his duty to society; that he
was in fact behaving beautifully,
with infinite tact, like an accomplished
gentleman. I could not
understand that the social canons
of his ‘set’ made it incumbent on
a man to joke and laugh and demean
himself in this lively, careless
fashion towards the man whom he
was going to shoot in a few hours.
I grew inwardly exasperated, and
it was nothing but pride and an unprecedented
effort of will that enabled
me to keep my temper and
remain outwardly cool. For a time,
for about twenty minutes, the luck
continued in the same vein; my
half-sovereign had been paid back
to me more than fifty times. Col.
Leveson was right when he said he
had sold his hand for a song. Hallam
was all this time standing behind
my chair, smoking his cigar,
and throwing in a word between
the puffs. The clock struck two.</p>

<p>“‘Come off now, Botfield,’ he
said, tapping me on the shoulder&mdash;‘come
off while your star is shining;
it is sure to go down if you
stay too long.’</p>

<p>“‘Very likely, most sage and
prudent mentor,’ retorted Lord
George; ‘but that cuts both ways.
Your friend has been pocketing
our money up to this; it’s only fair
he should give us a chance of winning
it back and pocketing a little
of his. That is a law <em>universally</em>
recognized, I believe.’ As he said
this, he turned to me good-humoredly
enough; but I saw where the
emphasis pointed, and, stung to the
quick, I replied that I had not the
least intention of going counter to
the law; I would remain as long as
the game lasted.</p>

<p>“‘Halloo! That’s committing
yourself somewhat rashly,’ interposed
Hallam. ‘You don’t know
what nefarious gamblers these fellows
are; they’re capable of keeping
it up till morning!’</p>

<p>“‘If they do, I shall keep it up
with them,’ I replied recklessly. I
was desperate, and my luck was
good.</p>

<p>“Hallam said no more, but sauntered
to the other side of the table,
where I <em>felt</em> his eyes fixed on me
warningly, entreatingly.</p>

<p>“I looked up at last, and met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
them fastened on me in a mute,
impatient appeal. I answered it
by a peremptory nod. He saw I
would not brook farther interference,
so he took himself off to the
billiard-room, and did not reappear
for an hour.</p>

<p>“I cannot recall clearly what
passed during the interval. The
luck had turned suddenly against
me; but, nothing daunted, I went
on playing desperately, losing as fast
as I had been winning, only in
much heavier sums; for the stakes
had risen enormously on the change
of luck. There was a large pool,
immense it seemed to me&mdash;some
two hundred pounds. I lost again
and again. At last terror sobered
me. I began to realize the madness
of my conduct, and wanted to withdraw;
but they cried out against
it, reminded me that I had pledged
myself to remain and see the game
out. Lord George was loudest in
protesting that I must remain.
‘One can’t have luck always,’ he
said, ‘A man must put up with it
when the tide turns. It is of good
omen for you, Mr. Botfield,’ he
added pointedly; ‘you will be in
splendid luck to-morrow.’</p>

<p>“I shuddered. I can remember
the horrible, sick sensation that
ran through me as he said this,
lightly, pleasantly, as if he alluded
to a rowing-match I had in view.
I saw my mother’s pale face beckoning
me to come away&mdash;to stop
before I ruined her utterly. I almost
made a movement to rise, but
something glued me to the chair.
The game went on. I again held
the bank, and again lost. I had
no money about me except the
forty pounds or so I had won at
the outset; but several leaves out
of my pocketbook were strewn
about the table bearing I. O. U.’s for
nine times that sum. I suppose
by this time I had quite lost my
senses. I know that I went on
betting like a maniac, with the
feverish, triumphant impulse of a
man in delirium. I was losing tremendously.
I remember nothing
except the sound of my own voice
and Lord George’s calling <em>banco!</em>
again and again, and how the cry
ran through me like a blade every
time, and how I hastily tore out
fresh leaves and wrote down the
sums I lost, and tossed them to the
winner, and went on. All this
time we had been drinking deeply of
brandy and water. I was naturally
abstemious, but to-night I drank
recklessly. The wonder was&mdash;and I
was going to say the pity&mdash;that it
had not stupefied me long ago, and
so made me physically incapable
of continuing my insane career.
But excitement acted, I suppose, as
an antidote, and prevented the
alcohol from taking effect as it
otherwise must have done. At
last Hallam came back. I have a
vague recollection of hearing him
exchange some remarks in an undertone
with one of the players,
who had given up and was now
watching the game with a number of
others who had dropped in from adjoining
rooms. I then heard him say,
‘Good God! he is ruined twice
over!’ I heard nothing more. I
had fallen back insensible in my
chair. Everybody started up; the
cards were dropped, and all was
confusion and terror. It appears
that at the first moment they
thought I was dead. A young
guardsman present declared I was,
and that it was disease of the
heart; a young kinsman of his had
dropped down on parade only a
month ago just in the same way.
There was a cry for a doctor, and
two or three ran out to fetch one.
Before he arrived, however, I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
given signs of returning consciousness.
Up to this moment Lord
George had been anxiously looking
on, silent and pale, they said. He
had borne me with Hallam to a
couch in the next room, where the
air was free from cigar-fumes, and
had opened the window to admit
the fresh night-breeze. He had
done, in fact, what any humane person
would have done under the
circumstances; but he had done it
in a manner that betokened more
than ordinary interest. He drew an
audible breath of relief the moment
he saw my eyelids quiver and
heard me breathe like a man awaking
to life. Hallam signed to him
to leave the room; he did not
wish his face to be the first I saw
on opening my eyes. Lord George
no doubt understood; for he at
once withdrew into the card-room.
He drew the door after him, but
he did not quite close it, so that I
heard dreamily, yet distinctly, all
that was said. Lord George’s second
for the morrow’s meeting, the
Hon. Capt. Roper, inquired eagerly
how I was going on. ‘Oh! he’ll
be all right presently,’ was the reply,
spoken in Lord George’s off-hand
way. ‘There was nothing to make
such a fuss about; the poor devil
was scared to see how much money
he had lost, and fainted like a girl&mdash;that’s
all.’</p>

<p>“‘Hallam says he is quite cleared
out by to-night’s ill-luck,’ observed
some one.</p>

<p>“‘Served him right,’ said Lord
George; ‘it will teach puppies of
his kind not to come amongst us
and make fools of themselves.’</p>

<p>“‘And do you mean to shoot
him to-morrow?’ inquired the same
voice.</p>

<p>“‘I mean to give him a chance
of shooting me; unless,’ he continued&mdash;and
I saw in imagination, as
vividly as if my bodily eyes had seen
it, the cold sneer that accompanied
the remark&mdash;‘unless he shows the
white feather and declines fighting,
which is just as likely.’</p>

<p>“While this little dialogue had
been going on in subdued tones
close by the door which opened at
the head of the sofa where I lay,
Hallam was conversing in animated
whispers with two gentlemen in the
window. He was not more than a
minute absent, when he returned to
my side, and, seeing my eyes wide
open, exclaimed heartily: ‘Thank
God! he’s all right again!’</p>

<p>“I grasped his hand and sat up.
They gave me some sal-volatile and
water to drink, and I was, as he
said, all right again. But it was
not the stimulant that restored me,
that gave me such sudden energy,
and nerved me to act at once, to
face my fate and defy it. I took
his arm, and led him, or let him lead
me, to some quieter place near, and
then I asked him how much he
thought I had lost.</p>

<p>“‘Don’t think of that yet, my
dear fellow,’ he said; ‘you are too
done up to discuss it. We will see
what can be done to-morrow.’</p>

<p>“‘Five thousand pounds!’ I
said. ‘Do you hear that? Five
thousand pounds! That means
that I am a beggar, which an’t of
much consequence; and that I’ve
made a beggar of my mother. She
will have to sell the bed from under
her to pay it, to save my honor.
A curse upon me for bringing this
blight upon her!’</p>

<p>“‘Tut! tut! man, don’t take on
like a woman about it!’ said Hallam.
‘These things can be arranged;
no need to make matters out
worse than they are. I’ll speak to
Lord George, and see what terms
we can make with him.’</p>

<p>“He made me light a cigar, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
left me alone, while he went back to
parley with the man who held my
fortune, my life, my all in his hands.
I never heard exactly all that passed
between them. I only know that
in answer to Lord George’s question,
put in a tone of insulting
haughtiness, ‘Has the fellow pledged
himself for more than he’s
worth? <em>Can’t</em> he pay?’ Hallam
replied: ‘He can, but it will ruin
him’; upon which the other retorted
with a laugh, ‘What the devil is
that to me?’ and turned his back
on my second, who had nothing left
but to take Capt. Roper aside and
arrange for the morrow’s meeting.
He came back, and told me all
was settled; that Halberdyne was
behaving like a brute, and would
be tabooed in the clubs and every
decent drawing-room before twenty-four
hours. This thought seemed
to afford him great satisfaction.
It gave me none. Anguish
had drowned resentment. I could
think of nothing except that I was
a ruined man, that I had beggared
my mother, and that I was going to
fight a duel in a few hours. Richmond
Park&mdash;6 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>&mdash;pistols at
thirty paces! This was how the
appointment was notified by our
seconds to both of us. Suddenly
a light burst on me&mdash;a ray of hope,
of consolation: I might be killed
in this duel, and, if so, surely my
honor would be saved and my debt
cancelled. Lord George would not
pursue my mother for the money.
She should know nothing of this
night’s work until after the meeting.
If I escaped with a wound, I
would tell her; if I died, who would
have the cruelty to do so? I told
Hallam of this sudden thought as
he walked home with me. He approved
of it, and cheered me up by
almost assuring me that I should be
shot. Halberdyne was a dead-shot;
it was most likely that I
should not leave the field alive.</p>

<p>“The night passed&mdash;the few
hours of it that must elapse before
the time named for the meeting.
0 God! how did I live through
them? And yet this was nothing,
absolutely nothing, compared to
what was yet in store for me.…</p>

<p>“The duel took place. Lord
George wounded me in the hip.
He escaped unhurt; I fired in the
air. I was carried home on a door,
insensible. Hallam had gone before
to prepare my mother. For some
weeks it was feared I would not live.
Then amputation was talked of. I escaped
finally with being a cripple for
life. Before I was out of danger, Hallam’s
leave expired, and he went to
rejoin his regiment. He had been
very assiduous in calling to inquire
for me, had seen my mother, and,
judging by her passionate grief
that I was in a fair way not to recover,
he had forborne mentioning
anything about the five thousand
pounds. She promised to write
and let him know when any change
took place. Meantime, she had
found out my secret. I had talked
incessantly of it in my delirium, and
with an accuracy of iteration that
left no doubt on her mind but that
there was a foundation of truth in
the feverish ravings. The doctor
was of the same mind, and urged
her to give me an opportunity of
relieving my mind of the burden,
whatever it was, as soon as this was
possible.</p>

<p>“The first day that I was strong
enough to bear conversation she
accordingly broached the subject.
I inferred at once that Hallam had
told her everything, and repeated
the miserable story, only to confirm
what I supposed he had already
said.</p>

<p>“My mother was sitting by my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
bedside. She busied herself with
teaseling out linen into lint for my
wound, and so, purposely no doubt,
kept her face continually bent or
averted from mine.</p>

<p>“Seeing how quietly she took it,
I began to think I had overrated the
misfortune; that we had larger resources
in some way than I had imagined.
‘Then it is possible for us
to pay this horrible debt and save
my honor, and yet not be utterly
beggared, mother?’ I said eagerly.
She looked at me with a smile that
must surely have been the reflex
of some angel near her whom I
could not see. ‘Yes, my boy; he
shall be paid, and we shall not be
beggars,’ she said gently, and pressed
my hand in both her own. ‘You
should have told me about it at
once; it has been preying on your
mind and retarding your cure all
this time. I will see Mr. Kerwin
to-day, and have it arranged at
once. Promise me now, like a good
boy, to forget it and think no more
of it until you are quite well. Will
you promise?’</p>

<p>“I did not answer, but signed
with my lips for her to kiss me. She
rose and twined her arms around
me, and let me sob out my sorrow
and my love upon her breast.</p>

<p>“It was about three days after
this that she handed me a letter to
read; it was from Lord George to
Mr. Kerwin, and ran thus:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I beg to acknowledge the
receipt of the sum of five thousand
pounds which you have forwarded
to my lawyers in the name of Mr.
Botfield. I make this acknowledgment
personally in order to express
my sincere satisfaction at the happy
progress of Mr. Botfield’s recovery,
and beg you will convey this sentiment
to him.&mdash;I remain, etc.,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Halberdyne</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>“‘Mother! mother!’ I cried out,
and opened my arms to her in a
passion of tears. But she laid her
finger smilingly on my lips, and
made me be silent. In a month
hence, when I was well, we should
talk it all over, but not now.</p>

<p>“Before the month was out, <em>she
was dead</em>!”…</p>

<p class="break">Marmaduke started to his feet
with a cry of horror, and Botfield,
unable to control the anguish that
his own narrative evoked, dropped
his head into his hands, and shook
the room with his sobs.</p>

<p>“O dear God! that I should have
lived to tell it!&mdash;to talk over the
mother that I murdered! Brave,
tender, generous mother! I killed
you, I broke your heart, and then&mdash;then
I brought shame upon your
memory! O God! O God! why
have I outlived it?” He rocked
to and fro, almost shouting
in his paroxysm of despair. Marmaduke
had never beheld such
grief; he had never in his life been
so deeply moved with pity. He
did not know what to say, what to
do. His heart prompted him to do
the right thing: he fell on his knees,
and, putting his arms around the
wretched, woe-worn man, he burst
into tears and sobbed with him.</p>

<p>Botfield suffered his embrace for
a moment, and then, pressing his
horny palm on the young man’s
blond head, he muttered: “God
bless you! God bless you for your
pity!”</p>

<p>As soon as they were both
calmed, Marmaduke asked him if
he would not prefer finishing the
story to-morrow. But he signed to
him to sit down; that he would go
on with it to the end.</p>

<p>“What is there more to tell?” he
said, sadly shaking his head.</p>

<p>“I was lying a cripple on my bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
when she was carried to her grave.
I was seized with a violent brain
fever, which turned to typhus, and
they took me to the hospital. The
servants were dismissed; they had
received notice from my mother.
She had foreseen everything, taken
every necessary step as calmly as if
the catastrophe I had brought upon
her had been a mere change of residence
for her own convenience.
All we had was gone. That brave
answer of hers to my question
about our resources was a subterfuge
of her love. If ever a sin was
sinless, assuredly that half-uttered
falsehood was. She had directed
the lawyer to raise the money immediately,
at every sacrifice. She
meant to work for her bread, and
trusted to me to make the task light
and short to her. I would have
done it had she been spared to me.
So help me God, I would! But
now that she was gone, I had
nothing to work for. I left the
hospital a cripple and a beggar. I
did not even yet know to what an
extent. I went straight to our old
house, expecting to find it as I had
left it&mdash;that is, before all consciousness
had left me. I found it dismantled,
empty; painters busy on
scaffolding outside. I went to Mr.
Kerwin, and there learned the
whole truth. Nothing remained to
me but suicide. Nothing kept me
from it, I believe, but the prayers of
my mother.”</p>

<p>“You were a Christian, then?”
interrupted Marmaduke in a tone
of unfeigned surprise.</p>

<p>“I ought to have been. My
father was, and my mother was; I
was brought up as one, until I went
to the university and lost what little
belief I had. For a moment it
seemed to come back to me when I
found myself alone in the world.
I remember walking deliberately
down to the river’s side when I left
the lawyer’s office, fully determined
to drown myself. But before I
reached the water, I heard my
mother’s voice calling so distinctly
to me to stop that I felt myself arrested
as by some visible presence.
I heard the voice saying, ‘Do you
wish never to see me again even in
the next world?’ Of course it was
the work of imagination, of my
over-wrought feelings; but the effect
was the same. I stopped, and
retraced my steps to Mr. Kerwin’s.”</p>

<p>“It was your guardian angel, perhaps
your mother’s, that saved you,”
said Marmaduke.</p>

<p>“Oh! I forgot,” said Botfield.
“Your brother is a Catholic; I suppose
you are too?”</p>

<p>Marmaduke nodded assent; he
felt that his Catholicity was not
much to boast of. Like the poor
outcast before him, he had lost his
faith practically, though he adhered
to it in name.</p>

<p>“Yes, it was an angel of some
sort that rescued me,” said Botfield;
“it was no doubt my own
fault if the rescue was not complete.
I went back to Mr. Kerwin,
and asked him to give me, or get
me, something to do. My chance
on the stage was at an end, even if
I could have turned to that: I was
dead lame. He got me a situation
as clerk in an office; but the weariness
of the life and the pressure of
remorse were more than I could
bear. I took to drink. They forgave
me once, twice; the third time
I was dismissed. But of what use
is it to go over that disgusting, pitiable
story? Step by step I went
down, lower and lower, sinking
each time into fouler depths, drinking
more loathsome draughts, wallowing
in mire whose very existence
such as you don’t dream of.
I will spare you all those details.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
Enough that I came at last to what
you see me. One day when hunger
was gnawing me, and even the
satanic consolation of the public-house
was shut against me for want
of a sixpence to pay for a glass of
its diabolical elixir, I fell in with
a man of the trade; he offered me
work and bread. Hunger is not a
dainty counsellor. I closed with
the offer, and so sank into the last
slough that humanity can take refuge
in.…</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Walpole, you have
heard my history; it was a pain,
and yet, somehow, a relief, to me
to tell it. It has not been a very
pleasant one for you to listen
to; still, I don’t regret having inflicted
it on you. You are very
young; you are prosperous and
happy, and, most likely, perfectly
free from any of the temptations
that have been the bane of my life;
still, it never hurts a young man
starting in life to hear an older
man’s experience. If ever temptation
should come near you, dash it
from you with all your might;
scorn and defy it from the first;
hold no parley with it; to treat
with perdition is to be lost.”</p>

<p>“You have done me a greater
service than you know of,” said
Marmaduke, rising and preparing
to take leave of his singular entertainer.
“Perhaps one day I may
tell you.…” He took a turn in
the narrow room, and then, coming
back to Botfield, resumed in an agitated
manner: “Why should I not
own it at once? You have trusted
me with all; I will tell you the
truth.”</p>

<p>Botfield looked up in surprise,
but said nothing.</p>

<p>“I stand on the very brink of
the abyss against which you warn
me. Like you, I am a barrister;
like you, I hate my profession, and
spend my time reading poetry and
playing at private theatricals. They
are my passion. A few nights ago I
tried my luck at cards, and won.
This tempted me; I played last
night and lost&mdash;precisely the sum
of twenty pounds.”</p>

<p>Botfield started and uttered a
suppressed exclamation.</p>

<p>“I am in debt&mdash;not much&mdash;a
mere trifle, if it lead to no worse!
You see now what a service you
may have done me; who knows?
Perhaps my mother’s guardian angel
prompted you to tell me your
story as a warning, to save me before
it was too late! I know that
I came here to-day at the bidding
of an angel; and reluctant enough
I was to take the message!”</p>

<p>“I never thought to be of use to
any one while I lived,” said Botfield
with emotion. “I bless God,
anyhow, if my wretched example
proves a warning to you. Who
sent you to me? I understood it
was your brother?”</p>

<p>“So it was; but it was to please
my sister that I consented to come.
She is one of those angels that
people talk about, but don’t often
see. You will let her come and
see you, Mr. Botfield, will you
not?”</p>

<p>He held out his delicate lavender
kid hand, and pressed Botfield’s
grimy fingers cordially.</p>

<p>When Marmaduke got home, he
inquired at once where his sister
was, and, hearing she was in her
room, he crept up quietly to the
door and knocked. He entered so
quietly that Nelly had scarcely
time to jump off her knees. Marmaduke
saw at once that he had
taken her by surprise; he saw also
that her eyes were red.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” she asked,
with a frightened look. “Has
anything happened? You have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
been away so long! What kept
you, Marmaduke? Where have
you been?”</p>

<p>“Where you sent me.”</p>

<p>“To Stephen’s poor man? Why,
you have been out nearly two
hours! It did not take all that
time to give your message?” said incredulous
Nelly, and her heart beat
with recent apprehension.</p>

<p>“No; but Stephen’s poor man
had a message for me. Sit down
here, and I will tell you what it
was. But how cold you are, darling!
You are positively perished!
Where have you been?”</p>

<p>“Here,” said Nelly.</p>

<p>“Ever since I went out?”</p>

<p>“Ever since you went out.”</p>

<p>“What were you doing?” he persisted,
fixing a strange look on her.</p>

<p>She blushed, hesitated, and then
said simply, “I was praying for you,
Marmaduke.”</p>

<p>He folded her in his arms, and
whispered, “I was right to say it
was an angel sent me.”</p>

<p>Then, taking a warm shawl that
he saw hanging up, he wrapped
her in it, and sat down beside her,
and told the story as it had been
told to him. When it was over,
Nelly’s head was on his breast, and
the brother’s tears of penitence
were mingling with the sister’s
tears of joy.</p>

<p>“Let us go down now and tell
Stephen,” said Marmaduke, when
he had finished.</p>

<p>“Will you tell him everything?”
asked Nelly.</p>

<p>“Yes, everything.”</p>

<p>“Dear Marmy! I am so happy
I could sing for joy,” she said,
smiling through her tears. “Let us
kneel down here and say one little
prayer together; will you?”</p>

<p>And he did.</p>

<p>“How did you thaw the man
and break up the ice he seemed to
be buried under?” was Stephen’s
amazed inquiry when other more
precious and interesting questions
were exhausted.</p>

<p>“I merely did what Nelly told
me,” said Marmaduke: “I listened
to him.”</p>

<p>On Christmas morning Marmaduke
announced his intention of
dining out. It was a sacrifice to
all three, but no one opposed him.
Nelly made up a store of provisions,
including a hot plum-pudding,
which was put with other
steaming hot dishes into the ample
basket that the gay young man
carried off in a cab with him to
Red Pepper Lane. There he found
a clean hearth, a blazing fire, and
a table spread with a snowy cloth,
and all necessaries complete.
Some fairy had surely been at work
in that gloomy place. The host
was clean and brushed, looking
like an eccentric gentleman in his
new clothes amidst those incongruous
surroundings. He and
Marmaduke unpacked the basket
with many an exclamation at its
inexhaustible depths. That was
the happiest, if not the very merriest,
Christmas dinner that ever
Marmaduke partook of.</p>

<p>When it was over, and they were
puffing a quiet cigar over the fire,
steps were heard on the rickety
stairs, and then a knock at the
door, and a silvery voice saying:
“May we come in?” It was Stephen
and Nelly.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why you should
have all the pleasure to yourself,”
said Nelly, with her bright laugh;
“you would never have been here
at all if I had not teased you into
taking the message!”</p>

<p class="break">If this were a romance instead
of a true episode, the story should
end by the some-time rag-and-bone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
man becoming a Catholic, rising to
wealth and distinction, and marrying
Nelly. But the events of real
life don’t adjust themselves so conveniently
to the requirements of
the story-teller. Stephen Walpole
got Mr. Botfield a situation in the
post-office, where, by good conduct
and intelligent diligence, he rose
gradually to a position of trust,
which was highly paid. He never
married. Who knows? Perhaps
he had his little romance, and
never dared to tell it.</p>

<h3>THE PROTESTANT EPISCOPAL CHURCH CONGRESS.</h3>

<p>The second annual Congress of
the Protestant Episcopal Church in
the United States was held at Philadelphia
during the early part of November.
Church congresses are new
things in this country, and the Episcopalians
are not yet quite at home in
them. Their first experiment, made
at New York in 1874, was not wholly
successful. Some of their leading
bishops and presbyters treated it
rather cavalierly, apparently in the
fear that it was going to weaken the
bonds of ecclesiastical discipline,
and open vexatious questions which
the church for years had been expending
all its learning and ingenuity
in trying <em>not</em> to answer. But church
congresses seemed to be very proper
and respectable things for every denomination
which laid claim to antiquity:
they are common in the
mother-church of England; they
are efficient and interesting organizations
in what our Anglican friends
are pleased to call the Roman
branch of the church of Christ;
Dr. Döllinger has them regularly in
the Old-Catholic “branch”; and so
the originators of the movement in
the American “branch” have persevered
in their attempt to establish
them here. The meeting in Philadelphia
appears to have been all that its
promoters could have reasonably expected.
The denominational papers
of various shades of opinion
concur in believing that the permanency
of the Congress as an annual
institution is now nearly secured;
and we find one of these journals rejoicing
that the meeting passed off
with “entire cordiality,” and that
nothing in the proceedings “elicited
prejudice or excited hostile action.”
This indeed was something to boast
of. Perhaps it would have been
still more gratifying had not the
same paper explained that this unexpected
peaceableness of the Congress
arose “from the fact that no
resolutions were adopted, no legislation
proposed, no elections held.
When any of these are distinctly in
view, those who participate range
themselves into parties, and it is
almost impossible not to resort to
measures to ensure victory which
generate unkind feelings and provoke
exaggerated statements.” All
which gives us a queer idea of the
manner in which the Holy Ghost is
supposed to operate in the councils
of the Protestant Episcopal Church.
But no matter. Let us be glad, for
the sake of propriety, that this was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
merely a meeting for talk, and not
for action. The strict rules applicable
to conventions, synods, and
other business meetings were not
in force. The topics of discussion
were not so much points of doctrine
as minor questions of discipline and
methods of applying the machinery
of the church to the every-day work
of religion. And with the knowledge
that no vote was to be taken
upon any subject whatever, the
Congress unanimously agreed to let
every man say what he pleased.
The great variety of irreconcilable
things which it accordingly pleased
the gentlemen to say seems to have
attracted remark, and denominational
papers point to it with pride
as a proof of the large toleration
allowed within the bosom of the
church. If they like it, far be it
from us to interfere with their enjoyment.</p>

<p>The Episcopal Church is one of
the largest and richest of the Protestant
sects. Its clergy are popularly
supposed to boast of more
general culture and enjoy fuller opportunities
for study than those of
the other religious bodies, and its
people are found in large numbers
among the educated and well-to-do
classes. A congress of this church,
gathered from all parts of the country,
representing all shades of opinion,
and possessing almost unbounded
facilities for talk and deliberation,
ought therefore to have
elicited a great deal that was worth
remembering. The programme of
the sessions was stated in an alluring
manner by Bishop Clarke, of
Rhode Island, who made the introductory
address. “We come,”
said he, “to consider how the doctrine
and organization of the church
can be brought most effectually to
sanctity”; and then he went on
to speak briefly of the particular
things, in our daily experience,
which the church ought to purify
and bless&mdash;our business affairs, our
amusements, our care of the poor,
our family relations, the marriage
tie&mdash;practical points all of them,
and points, too, in which the church
and the state are more or less in
contact.</p>

<p>Well, having laid out this plan
of work, how did the Congress address
itself to it? The first session
gave a rather curious illustration
of the practical spirit of the
assemblage; for the reverend gentlemen,
by way of “bringing the
doctrine and organization of the
church most effectually to sanctity,”
rushed straightway with hot haste
into the subject of “ultramontanism
and civil authority,” and
pounded upon the doors of the
Vatican the whole afternoon. The
Rev. Francis Wharton, D.D., of
Cambridge, Mass., was careful in
the outset to distinguish between
ultramontanism and the Roman
Catholic Church in the United
States. The mass of us, he believes,
have always been loyal to the
territory of whose population we
form a part, but our loyalty has no
connection with our religion. If
we followed the teachings of our
church, Dr. Wharton thinks we
should be a dangerous set of
people. “Ultramontanism teaches
that the Pope, a foreign prince, deriving
his support from a foreign
civilization, is entitled to set aside
governments which he considers
disloyal, and to annul such institutions
as he does not approve.” We
confess that we do not know what
Dr. Wharton means by the Pope
deriving his support from a foreign
civilization. If he means his physical
support, then the doctor is
both wrong and right; for that is
derived from the faithful of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
whole world. If he means that his
authority is derived from a foreign
civilization, then the doctor is apparently
irreverent; for the papal
authority is derived from the institution
of Our Lord Jesus Christ,
and surely a respectable Cambridge
divine would not call that a foreign
civilization.</p>

<p>As for the distinction which is
drawn between American and ultramontane
Catholics, let us repudiate
it with all possible warmth
before we go any further. Ultramontanism
is an objectionable word,
because it was invented to localize
a school of religious doctrine which
is the only <em>catholic</em> school&mdash;the
school acknowledged all over the
world; but if it be understood as
defining that spirit of faith and piety
which yields all love and obedience
to the Vicar of Christ, accepts
all the Vatican decrees gladly and
without reserve, is not afraid of
paying too much respect to the
Holy See, or showing too much
humility before God, or believing
one little particle more than we are
commanded to believe under pain
of anathema, then the Catholics of
America are ultramontane Catholics
to a man. Probably there are
no Catholics in any country of the
world less disposed to compromise
in matters of religious duty, and
more thoroughly imbued with filial
reverence and love for the Head
of God’s church on earth, than the
Catholics of the United States.
The spirit of the church in Rome
is the spirit of the church in America;
and when Dr. Wharton asserts
that “the political tenets of ultramontanism
are repudiated by the
leading Catholic statesmen of our
land,” he makes an utterly erroneous
statement, against which American
Catholics will be the first to
protest. It is very true that with
the fictitious ultramontanism conceived
of his fears and prejudices
neither Americans nor any other
sensible people have the slightest
sympathy. But show us what Rome
teaches, and there you have precisely
what the church in the United
States accepts. If it is true, therefore
that the Pope claims authority “to
set aside governments which he
considers disloyal, and to annul
such institutions as he does not
approve,” it must be true that
America upholds his pretensions.
Dr. Wharton may live in the fear
that His Holiness will some day
send the Noble Guard to set aside
the government of Gen. Grant
whenever it becomes “disloyal”;
while he may well feel an absolute
certainty that our common-school
system, our constitutional prohibition
of the establishment of a state
church, our laws against sectarian
appropriations, and various other
wicked and heretical provisions
found on our statute-books, will
sooner or later be “annulled” by
a decree from the Vatican. He
need not flatter himself that any
superior enlightenment among the
Catholics of America will save the
Protestant community from the
miserable fate in store for it. We
are not a bit wiser or better than
the Pope.</p>

<p>The possible interference of the
Vatican with our Congresses and
ballot-boxes Dr. Wharton evidently
regards as a very remote danger.
There are points, however, he
thinks, where the Vatican clashes
every day with the civil power, and
where it ought to be resisted with
all the energy at our command.
And just at this part of the reverend
doctor’s address we should like
very much to have seen the face of
Bishop Clarke. In his introductory
remarks Bishop Clarke told the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
Congress that one of the most important
subjects for churchmen to
consider was the influence or authority
of the church over the family
relations. “The Gospel obtained
hold of the family before it
touched the state. How does the
condition of the marriage bond
stand to-day? In some of our
States it is as easy to solve it as it
is to join it. Is this the religion
of which we have made such
boast?” But here, before the
echoes of the bishop’s words
have fairly died away, is the
Rev. Dr. Wharton on his feet
denouncing as a crime the very interference
which Bishop Clarke inculcated
as a duty. It is one of
the usurpations of ultramontanism,
says the Cambridge doctor, to annul
civil marriages which the state
holds binding, and to treat as invalid
divorces which the state holds
good. This is one of the most serious
conflicts between the state
and the Vatican, and it is one, if
we understand aright the somewhat
imperfect report of his remarks,
in which Protestant Episcopalians
must prepare themselves to take
an earnest part, remembering that,
while their church is free, it is “a
free church within a free sovereign
state, and that this state, in its own
secular sovereignty, is supreme.”
Here, then, we have a distinct declaration
that the family relation is
not a proper subject of religious
regulation. If the state sees fit to
make it as easy to loose the marriage
bond as to tie it, the church
has no right to object; it is a secular
matter, and the free sovereign
state is supreme in its own secular
sovereignty. If the state sanctions
an adulterous connection, the
Protestant Episcopal Church must
revise its Bible and bless the unholy
tie; it is a secular matter, and
the free sovereign state is supreme
in its own secular sovereignty.
The sanctity of the family relation
is under the protection of the
church, says Bishop Clarke. No
such thing, replies Dr. Wharton&mdash;that
is an insolent ultramontane
pretension; the Protestant Episcopal
Church knows its place, and
does not presume to interfere with
the legislature. “The Gospel obtained
hold of the family before it
touched the state,” says the bishop.
“Oh! well, we have changed
all that,” rejoins the doctor; the
glory of the Protestant Episcopal
gospel nowadays is that it lets
the family alone. In point of fact,
Episcopalianism is not quite so
bad as this hasty advocate would
have us believe; for it does censure,
in a mild way, the laxity of some
of the divorce laws, and does not
always lend itself to the celebration
of bigamous marriages. But Dr.
Wharton is correct in his main position&mdash;that
his church leaves to the
state the control of the family relation;
and if she shrinks from the
logical consequences of her desertion
of duty, that is only because a
remnant of Catholic feeling remains
to her in the midst of her
heresies and contradictions. The
time must come, however, when
these illogical fragments of truth
will be thrown away, and the Protestant
Episcopal Church will take
its place beside the other Protestant
bodies in renouncing all right
to be heard on one of the most important
points of contact between
the law of God and the concerns
of every-day life. It is impossible
to allow the civil power to bind
and loose the family tie at pleasure,
without admitting that the subject
is entirely outside the domain of
ecclesiastical supervision. The attempt
of the Episcopal Church to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
compromise on adultery is an absurdity,
and in the steady course
of Protestant development it will
surely be abolished.</p>

<p>Is there any particular in which
the Protestant Episcopal Church
fairly takes hold of the family? We
have seen that she abandons to
politicians the sacred tie between
the parents; what has she to do
with the next domestic concern&mdash;the
education of the child? Dr.
Wharton holds it to be one of her
distinguishing claims to public
favor that she abandons this duty
also to the secular power. The
right to control education, according
to him, is, like the right to sanction
the marriage tie, one of the insolent
pretensions of the Vatican
usurper. The state, he thinks, is
bound not only to educate all its
subjects, but to decide what points
a secular education shall cover,
while the church may only add to
this irreligious training such pious
instruction as the child may have
time and strength to receive after
the more serious lessons are over.
“The church,” he says, “concedes
to the state the right and duty to
require a secular education from all,
while for itself it undertakes, as a
free church in a free state, the right
and duty to give a religious education
to all within its reach.” Expressed
in somewhat plainer English,
this means that thirty hours a
week ought to be given to the dictionary
and multiplication table,
and one hour to the catechism and
the ten commandments. Send your
children to schools all the week
where they will hear nothing whatever
of religion, where that most
vital of all concerns will be a forbidden
subject, where the idea will
be practically, if not in so many
words, impressed upon their tender
minds that it is of no consequence
whether they are Christians, or
Jews, or infidels, so long as they
master the various branches of
worldly knowledge which promote
success in the secular affairs of
life; and then get them into Sunday-school
if you can, for a wild
and ineffectual attempt to counteract
the evil tendencies of the previous
six days’ teachings. This is
trying to give a Christian education
without the corner-stone of Christian
doctrine; building a house
upon the sand, and then running
around it once a week with a hatful
of pebbles and a trowel of mud to
put a foundation under the finished
structure. Dr. Wharton seems to
embody in his own person a surprising
variety of the inconsistencies
for which the Protestant Episcopal
Church has such a peculiar
celebrity. For here, after he has
claimed credit for his church as the
champion of a secular education,
he tells the Congress that secularism
is one of the great dangers of
the age, against which the church
must fight with all her strength.
“The battle with secularism has to
be fought out.” It must be fought
“by the church, and eminently by
our own church. Our duty therefore
is to fit ourselves for the encounter,
and we must do this with
the cause of religion, undertaking
in its breadth and embracing all
branches of religious, spiritual, and
ethical culture.” Well, but, dear
sir, you have just said that during
the most important period of man’s
intellectual development, when the
mind is receiving impressions which
are likely to last through life, the
church ought to stand aside and
let the state <em>teach</em> secularism without
hindrance. Are you going to
cultivate secularism in the young
until it becomes firmly rooted, and
then fight against it with sermons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
and essays which your secularized
young men will not listen to? How
do you expect to impart religious,
spiritual, and ethical culture when
you have formally renounced your
inestimable privilege and your sacred
duty as a guide and teacher
of children? You propose to wait
until your boys have come to man’s
estate before you attempt to exercise
any influence upon them; and
then, when they have grown up
with the idea that religious influence
ought to be avoided as one
avoids pestilence, you wonder and
complain that they are indifferent
to the church and will not hear
you. “The battle with secularism
has to be fought out.” Your way
of fighting is to abandon the outposts,
leave front and rear and
flanks unprotected, and throw
away your arms.</p>

<p>It was one of the peculiarities of
the Congress that whatever error
was promulgated in the essays and
debates, somewhere in the course
of the sessions an antidote was sure
to be furnished&mdash;this being an illustration,
we suppose, of the extreme
toleration of opinion to which Bishop
Clarke referred as “somewhat
singular” in a church “so
fixed in its doctrines.” Hence we
need not be surprised to find in the
second day’s proceedings a refutation
of the educational theories propounded
during the first. Dr.
Wharton made use of the principle
of secular schooling as a weapon
of offence against the Vatican. But
when the delegates had relieved
their minds and vindicated their
Protestant orthodoxy by giving the
poor Pope about as much as he
could stagger away with, they turned
their attention to their own condition,
and one of their first subjects
of inquiry was what secular education
had done for them. The topic
of consideration on the second
morning was “The Best Methods
of Procuring and Preparing Candidates
for the Ministry.” Dr.
Schenck of Brooklyn began by stating
that the supply of candidates
for holy orders was not only inadequate
to the needs of the church,
but it was falling off&mdash;a smaller
number offering themselves to-day
than six or seven years ago. This,
said he, should excite the gravest
concern of the church; and nobody
seemed disposed to contradict him.
Dr. Edward B. Boggs indeed presented
some uncomfortable statistics
which tell the whole story. In
1871, the number of resident presbyters
of the Episcopal Church in
the United States was 2,566; in
1874, it was only 2,530. Here, then
while the population increases the
clergy are diminishing. A great
many reasons were suggested for
the phenomenon. One thought the
question of salary was at the bottom
of the evil. Another blamed
mothers for not giving their boys a
taste for the ministry while they
were young. A third believed
the trouble was too little prayer
and too much quarrelling over candles
and ecclesiastical millinery.
And more than one hinted in the
broadest terms that the ministry
was discredited by having too many
fools in it.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> The truth, however,
which had been vaguely suggested
by some of the earlier speakers,
was plumply told by Dr. Edward
Sullivan of Chicago. “The
church,” said he, “must learn to
supply the ranks of the ministry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
from her own material”&mdash;that is to
say, by giving the children of the
church a Christian education. He
lamented the exclusion of the Bible
from some of the common schools
as a national calamity&mdash;not, if we
understand him, because he has any
overweening faith in the efficacy of
Bible-reading <i lang="la">per se</i>, but because
he knows that when positive religious
teaching is banished from the
school, the children can hardly fail
to grow up without any religious
feeling whatever. “<em>Until we establish
parochial church schools</em>,” he
continued, “<em>we can never solve this
problem.</em>” And he might have added
that if the teaching of secularism
is to be continued for a generation
or two longer, the problem will
solve itself: there will be no need
of preachers when there cease to be
congregations.</p>

<p>If such an alarming phenomenon
as an actual falling off in the numbers
of the clergy were noticed in
our own holy church, it would perhaps
occur to good Catholics to inquire
whether the bishops were doing
all that they ought to do for the
souls of their people. But the
Episcopal Congress at Philadelphia
seems to have been vexed with the
idea that the bishops were doing
entirely too much. Looking at the
assemblage from the outside, we
cannot pretend to see the under-currents
of opinion, or to comprehend
the denominational politics;
but it was plain both from the tone
of the addresses in the session set
apart for considering the “Nature
and Extent of Episcopal Authority”
and from the manner in which some
of the remarks of the speakers were
received, that a jealousy of episcopal
authority prevailed with considerable
bitterness. Dr. Vinton of Boston
drew a parallel between the government
of the church and the government
of the state; both were ruled
by executives appointed by law and
controlled by law, and in each case
the chief officer acted by the assumed
authority of those he governed.
The bishops therefore, we
infer, have just as much power as
the people choose to give them, and
we see no reason why the congregations
should not enlarge and restrict
that power at pleasure&mdash;make a new
constitution, if they wish, every
year, and treat their prelates as the
savage treats his idol, which he sets
upon an altar for worship in the
morning, and if things go not well
with him, kicks into the kennel at
night. Indeed, since the foundation
of the Anglican Church the
episcopate has always been treated
with scant ceremony. Dr. Vinton
tells us that it is a reflex of the political
organization, and as that has
varied a great deal in England and
America, and is not unlikely in the
course of time to vary a great deal
more, we must not be surprised to
find the system undergoing many
strange modifications and holding
out the promise of further change
indefinitely. In the primitive
church, the episcopacy was a despotism.
In the Anglican Church, it
is “merely an ecclesiastical aristocracy.”
In the Protestant Episcopal
Church of America, where the exigencies
of politics have to be considered,
it is&mdash;well, that is just what the
Congress tried in vain to determine.
For one thing, Dr. Vinton and other
speakers after him laid great stress
upon the fact that its authority was
carefully circumscribed by statute,
and that the church was a corporation&mdash;though
whence it derived its
charter nobody was good enough
to tell us. In truth, we did not
find the day’s proceedings edifying.
Dr. Vinton declared that an organic
evil of the church constitution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
“boding more of mischief and sorrow
to the body of Christ than any
or all of the evils besides that our
age makes possible,” was the liability
of bishops to grow arrogant
of power, to make their authority
troublesome, to put on idle pomp,
and set themselves “in conspicuous
difference from the taste, the traditions,
the educated and intelligent
convictions which the providence
of God has caused to rule in this
land.” Dr. Fulton of Indianapolis
inveighed with warmth against
any bishop who ventured to intrude
into another man’s diocese,
and remarked that “some bishops
were never at home unless they
were abroad.” A bishop, continued
the doctor, is subject to civil
law. He should be tried for violation
of the ninth commandment
if he wilfully slander a clergyman
either in or out of his own diocese.
Bishops must not affect infallibility
in doctrinal utterances. They
must remember that in more than
one respect they and their presbyters
are equals. A bishop who
would be respected must respect
the rights of other bishops&mdash;not
being an episcopal busybody in
other men’s sees. Dr. Goodwin
of Philadelphia thought that what
our Lord meant to have was “a
moderate episcopate.” Dr. Washburn
of New York believed that
even the powers granted to the
apostles were not exclusive, and
that ever since the apostolic age
these powers had been gradually
more and more distributed, until
now, we should think, they must
be so finely divided that no fragment
of them is anywhere visible
in the Episcopal Church.</p>

<p>Dr. J. V. Lewis convulsed the
house with laughter by a speech
in which he declared that the bishops
had been so “tied hand and
foot by conventions and canons
that it was wonderful they had time
to do anything but find out what
they must not do”; and he called
upon the church to “cut those
bands and let the bishops loose.”
We quote from the report of his
remarks in the <cite>Church Journal</cite>:
“What will they do? He would
tell them what they would do. He
had at home in his yard six chickens
about half-grown. He had
placed among them a turkey big
enough to eat any of them up.
But they all flew at him. One little
fellow pecked him and spurred
him savagely. The turkey looked
on in perfect astonishment, apparently;
but at length he spread out
his wings and literally <em>sat down</em>
upon him. From that day to this,
whenever that turkey stirs, these
chickens cannot be kept from following
him. And this is just what
will happen in the church, if we
will only let our bishops loose.”
All this was the cause of much innocent
hilarity among the brethren;
but we fear that it was to Dr. Lewis
that the <cite>Churchman</cite> referred the
next week in the following solemn
strain: “It is a sad circumstance
that the ministry has in it, here
and there, a professional joker and
cheap story-teller and anecdote-monger,
one of the most tedious
and least estimable types of foolishness
that try Christian endurance
and vex religious families. It is
to be hoped no such melancholy-moving
buffoon will ever propose
himself as clown to the Church
Congress; and, short of that, will
it be wise to confer the award of
the heartiest and loudest applause
on a sort of comic pleasantry and
‘jesting not convenient’ which,
at best, is outdone in its own line
in whole columns of daily newspapers?
We may smile, because it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
cannot be helped, but we can surely
reserve our plaudits&mdash;if they must
be given at all&mdash;for that species of
superiority which manifests a chaste
refinement and suits tastes that are
intellectual rather than jovial.”</p>

<p>Clearly there was a great deal
more in these essays on the limitations
of episcopal authority than
met the profane eye. Who are the
trespassers upon other men’s sheepfolds,
and the busybodies, and the
slanderers, and the pompous bishops,
and the infallible bishops,
and the bishops who think themselves
better than their presbyters,
it is not for us to inquire. Neither
perhaps would it be decorous to
ask how the ten or twelve bishops
in the Congress&mdash;none of whom
opened their mouths during the
debate&mdash;enjoyed the session. But
there is excellent reason to believe
that the presbyters had a very
pleasant day, singing the opening
hymn in the morning, “Come, gracious
Spirit, heavenly dove,” with
peculiar unction, and joyously dismissing
their right reverend fathers
in the afternoon with the verses,
“Go forth, ye heralds, in my name.”</p>

<p>If the bishops are in disrepute
and the inferior clergy are falling
away, it can hardly be necessary to
tell us that the church has no real
hold upon the people; that follows
as a matter of course. Accordingly,
the most interesting of the debates
were on the best methods of
giving vitality to the work of the
church&mdash;on ministrations to the laboring
classes, on free churches and
free preaching, on the abuses of
the new system, and on the need
of something equivalent to the
preaching Orders and Congregations
of our own church. Of all the papers
read at the Congress the only
one which was received with what
we may fairly call enthusiasm was
an essay by Mr. Francis Wells, editor
of the Philadelphia <cite>Evening
Bulletin</cite>, on the “Parochial System
and Free Preaching,” at the close
of which one of the reverend delegates
jumped upon a bench and
led the assembly in three cheers.
We have seen no report which gives
a fair abstract of Mr. Wells’ paper,
or even explains what practical
suggestions he had to offer, so that
it is impossible to understand what
it was that moved the feelings of
the Congress. But if he drew a
faithful picture of the average
Episcopal Church of our day he
may well have startled his audience.
“The chief trouble,” he
said, “lies in the spirit of exclusiveness
which eyes the fashion of
the dress and warns off strangers
with a cold stare.” He was quite
right in holding that the renting of
pews and the expenditure of large
sums of money for the adornment
of the house of God are not necessarily
obstacles to the influence of
the church over the masses. Our
own experience proves that. What
poor and ragged sinner was ever
repelled from a Catholic Church
by imposing architecture, or gorgeous
windows, or the blazing magnificence
of lighted altars, or the
strains of costly music? The rich
have their pews&mdash;at least in this
country, where it is only by pew-rents
that we can meet the necessary
expenses of the parish&mdash;but
the most wretched beggar feels that
he is welcome at all times in the
splendid temple, and he may kneel
there, feasting the senses, if he
pleases, as well as refreshing the
soul, without fear that his more
comfortable neighbor will stare at
his humble garments. Whatever
the character of our churches, it is
always the poor who fill them. It
never occurs to a Catholic that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
people who pay pew-rents acquire
any proprietorship in the house of
God, or have any better right there
than those who pay nothing. The
sermons are never made for the
rich, and the Holy Sacrifice is offered
for all indiscriminately. But
in the Episcopal Church how different
it is!</p>

<p>Imagine the feelings of a mechanic
who approaches one of the luxurious
Fifth-Avenue temples in his
patched and stained working trowsers
and threadbare coat. Carriages
are setting down the <i lang="fr">haut ton</i> at the
door, every lady dressed in the extreme
of fashion, every gentleman
carefully arrayed by an expensive
tailor. A high-priced sexton, with
rather more dignity than an average
bishop, receives the distinguished
arrivals just inside the lobby,
and scrutinizes strangers with the
air of an expert who has learned by
long experience in the highest circles
just what kind of company
every casual visitor has probably
been in the habit of keeping. The
interior of the church somehow
suggests a Madison-Avenue parlor,
furnished in the latest style of imitation
antique. The upholstery is
a marvel of comfort. The pleasantly
subdued light suits the eyes
and softens the complexions of
Christians who have been up late
dancing. A decorous quiet pervades
the waiting congregation,
broken only by the rustle of five-dollar
silks sweeping up the aisles.
Such a handsome display of millinery
can be seen nowhere else for
so little money. What is a working-man
to do in such a brilliant gathering
as this? He looks timidly at
the back seats, and he finds there
perhaps two or three old women,
parish pensioners, Sunday-school
boys, or young men who keep near
the door in order to slip out quietly
when they are tired of the services,
but nobody of his class. The prosperous
people all around him listen
to the choir, and the reader, and
the preacher, with an indescribable
air of proprietorship in all of them.
The sermon is an elaborate essay
addressed to cultivated intellects,
not to his common understanding.
He goes away with the uncomfortable
consciousness that he has been
intruding, and feels like a shabby
and unkempt person who has strolled
by mistake into the stockholders’
row at the Italian Opera, and been
turned out by a high-toned box-keeper.
“It is indeed hard to imagine,”
said <cite>The Nation</cite> the other
day, “anything more likely to make
religion seem repelling to a poor
man than the sight of one of the
gorgeous edifices in which rich
Christians nowadays try to make
their way to heaven. Working out
one’s salvation clothed in the height
of the fashion, as a member of a
wealthy club, in a building in which
the amplest provision is made for
the gratification of all the finer
senses, must seem to a thoughtful
city mechanic, for instance, something
in the nature of a burlesque.
Not that the building is too good
for the lofty purpose to which it is
devoted, for nobody ever gets an
impression of anything but solemn
appropriateness from a great Catholic
cathedral, but that it is the
property of a close corporation,
who, as it might be said, ‘make up
a party’ to go to the Throne of
Grace, and share the expenses
equally, and fix the rate so high
that only successful businessmen
can join.”</p>

<p>But we heed not enlarge upon
the prevalence of this evil. The
speakers at the Congress recognized
it frankly, and they are undoubtedly
aware, though they may not have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
deemed it prudent to confess, that
the case is growing more and more
serious all the time. As wealth
concentrates in the large cities and
habits of luxury increase, the Protestant
Episcopal Church is continually
becoming colder and colder
towards the poor. No remedy that
has been proposed holds out the
faintest promise of stopping this
alarming decline. No remedy proposed
even meets the approbation
of any considerable number of the
Episcopal clergy. One speaker proposes
a greater number of free
congregations, and is met by the
obvious objection that the result
would be a still more lamentable
separation between rich and poor,
with a different class of churches
for each set. Another recommends
the bishops to send missionary
preachers into every parish where
there seems to be need of their
labor, but does not tell us where
the missionaries are to be found,
and forgets that almost every parish
in the United States would have to
be supplied in this way before the
evil could be cured. A third advises
the rich and poor to meet together,
and fraternize and help each
other; and a fourth calls for more
zeal all around. All these proposals
are merely various ways of
stating the disease; they do not
indicate remedies. Perhaps it may
occur to some people that if the
Catholic Church and the Episcopal
Church correspond so closely in
their outward operations, both striving
to celebrate divine worship with
all possible splendor, both building
costly churches and supporting
them by pew-rents, both employing
highly paid choirs, both keeping up
a system of parishes, and if all the
while the one gathers people of
every rank and condition into her
fold, offering health and consolation
to all alike, while the other is constantly
losing the affections of the
multitude and becoming a lifeless
creature of forms and fashions, the
explanation of the difference after
all may be that the Holy Ghost
lives and works in the one, while
the other is only the device of man.</p>

<h3>YULE RAPS.<br />
<i>A CHRISTMAS STORY.</i></h3>

<p>We once saw a picture of a wide,
undulating snow-landscape, overspread
with a pale rosy tint from
the west, and we thought it a fancy
picture of an Arctic winter. It
hung in a pretty room in a Silesian
country-house. The weather was
lovely, warm but temperate; it was
mid-June, and the woods were full
of wild strawberries, and the meadows
of forget-me-nots. Yet that
landscape was simply Silesia in
the winter; the same place, six
months later, becomes a wilderness
of snow. What shall we say of
Mecklenburg, then, so much farther
to the north of Silesia? But even
there winter brings merriment; and
as in these snow-bound countries
there is less work to be got through
in the winter, their people associate
the ideas of pleasure and holiday
with the cold rather than the warm
weather. In Mecklenburg spring,
summer, and autumn mean work&mdash;ploughing,
sowing, haying, harvesting;
winter means fun and frolic,
peasants’ dances, farmers’ parties,
weddings, christenings, harvest-homes,
Christmas, New Year’s, and
Epiphany presents, gatherings of
friends, fireside talk, innocent games,
and general merriment.</p>

<p>In a little village in this province
the house of Emanuel Köhler was
famous for its jollity. Here were
old customs well kept up, yet always
with decorum and a regard to
higher matters. Emanuel was virtually
master of the estate of Stelhagen,
the absentee owner of which
was a gay young officer who never
wrote to his agent, except for a new
supply of money. Clever and enlightened
an agriculturist as old
Köhler was, it was sometimes difficult
for him to send the required
sums, and yet have enough to farm
the estate to his satisfaction. In
the language of the country, he was
called the inspector, and his house,
also according to the local custom,
was a kind of informal agricultural
school. At the time of our story he
had four young men under him&mdash;who
were in all respects like the apprentices
of the good old time&mdash;and two
of his own relatives, his son and his
nephew. His only daughter was
busy helping her mother, and learning
to be as efficient a housekeeper
as the young men to be first-rate farmers;
and this nucleus of young society,
added to the good Köhler’s
hearty joviality and the known
good-cheer always provided by
Frau Köhler, naturally made the
large, cosey, rambling house a pleasant
rendezvous for the neighborhood.
The Köhler household was
a host in itself, yet it always loved
to be reinforced on festive occasions
by the good people of the
village and farms within ten miles
round. So also the children, whether
poor or pretty well off, were
all welcome at old Emanuel’s, and
knew the way to the Frau Inspectorin’s
pantry as well as they knew
the path to the church or the
school. All the servant-girls in the
neighborhood wanted to get a place
in this house, but there was scarcely
ever a vacancy, unless one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
dairy-maids or the house-girls married.
Frau Köhler and her daughter
did all the kitchen work themselves,
and the latter, a thoughtful
girl, though she was only fifteen,
studied books and maps between-whiles.
But her studies never interfered
with the more necessary
knowledge that a girl should have
when, as Rika,<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> she has to depend
upon herself for everything. In
the country, in the Mecklenburg of
even a very few years ago, everything
was home-made, and a supply
of things from the large town
twenty or thirty miles off was the
event of a life-time. Such things
came as wedding-gifts; and though
fancy things came every Christmas,
even they were carefully and sacredly
kept as tokens of that miraculous,
strange, bewildering world
outside, in which people wore their
silk dresses every day, and bought
everything they wanted at large
shops a few steps from their own
houses. Frau Köhler often wondered
what other women did who
had no farm-house to manage, no
spinning, or knitting, or cooking, or
dairy-work to do; and when her
daughter Rika suggested that they
probably read and studied, she
shrugged her shoulders and said:
“Take care, child; women ought
to attend to women’s work. Studying
is a man’s business.”</p>

<p>The honest soul was a type of
many an old-fashioned German
house-mother, of whose wisdom it
were well that some of our contemporaries
could avail themselves; and
when Rika gently reminded her of
the story of Martha and Mary, she
would energetically reply:</p>

<p>“Very well; but take my word
for it, child, there was a woman
more blessed than <em>that</em> Mary, and
one who was nearer yet to her Lord;
and we do not hear of <em>her</em> neglecting
her house. I love to think of
that house at Nazareth as just a
model of household cleanliness and
comfort. You know, otherwise, it
could not have been a fitting place
for <em>Him</em>; for though he chose poverty,
he must needs have surrounded
himself with spotless purity.”</p>

<p>And Rika, as humble and docile
as she was thoughtful, saw in this
reverent and practical surmise a
proof that it is not learning that
comes nearest to the heart of truth,
but that clearer and directer knowledge
which God gives to “babes
and sucklings.”</p>

<p>This particular Christmas there
was much preparation for the family
festival. The kitchen was in a ferment
for a week, and mighty bakings
took place; gingerbread and
cake were made, and various confectionery-work
was done; for Frau
Köhler expected a friend of her
own early home to come and stay
with her this last week of the year.
This was the good old priest who
had baptized her daughter; for
neither mother nor daughter were
natives of Mecklenburg, though
the latter had grown up there, and
had never, since she was six months
old, gone beyond the limits of the
large estate which her father administered.
Frau Köhler was a Bavarian
by birth, and had grieved very
much when her Mecklenburg husband
had taken her to this northern
land, where his position and wages
were so good as to make it his duty
to abide and bring up his family.
But the worthy old creature had done
a wonderful deal of good since she
had been there, and kept up her
faith as steadfastly as ever she had at
home. Frederika had been her treasure
and her comfort; and between
the mother’s intense, mediæval firmness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
of belief, and the child’s naturally
deep and thoughtful nature, the
little farm-maiden had grown up a
rare combination of qualities, and
a model for the young Catholic
womanhood of our stormy times.
The old priest whom Frau Köhler
had looked up to before her marriage
as her best friend, and whom
Rika had been taught to revere
from her babyhood, had been very
sick, and was obliged to leave his
parish for a long holiday and rest.
His former parishioner was anxious
that he should see Christmas kept
in the old-fashioned northern style,
more characteristic than the Frenchified
southern manners would now
allow, even in her remote native
village. Civilization carries with it
the pick-axe and the rule; and when
young girls begin to prefer Manchester
prints and French bonnets to
homespun and straw hats, most of
the old customs slip away from their
homes.</p>

<p>In the sturdy Mecklenburg of
twenty years ago, even after the
temporary stir of 1848, things were
pretty much as they had been for
centuries, and it was Emanuel’s
pride that his household should be,
if needful, the last stronghold of
the good old usages. He heartily
acquiesced in his wife’s invitation
to the southern guest, and resolved
to have the best Christmas that had
been known in the country since
he had undertaken the care of the
Stelhagen estate. In truth, he lived
like a patriarch among his work-people;
his laborers and their families
were models of prosperity and
content, and the children of all the
neighborhood wished he were their
grandfather. Indeed, he was godfather
to half the village babies
born during his stay there.</p>

<p>The sleighs of the country were
the people’s pride. Some were
plain and strong, because their
owners were not rich enough to
adorn them, but others were quite
a curiosity to the visitor from the
south. They partook of the same
quaintness as the old yellow family
coaches that took the farmers to harvest-homes
and weddings before the
early snows came on. Lumbering,
heavy-wheeled vehicles these were,
swinging on high like a cradle tied
to a couple of saplings in a storm;
capacious as the house-mother’s
apron-pockets on a baking day;
seventy years old at least, barring
the numerous patchings and mendings,
new lining or new wheel,
occasionally vouchsafed to the
venerable representative of the
family dignity. The sleighs were
much gayer and a little less antiquated,
because oftener used,
and therefore oftener worn out; besides,
there were fashions in sleighs
even in this remote place&mdash;fashions
indigenous to the population,
each individual of which was capable
of some invention when sleighs
were in question. On Christmas
Eve, long before it grew dark, many
of these pretty or curious conveyances
clattered up to the farm-house
door. Some were laden with
children two rows deep, all wrapped
in knitted jackets, blankets,
boas, etc., and here and there covered
with a fur cap or furred hood;
for knitting in this neighborhood
supplied all with warm winter
wraps, even better than woven or
machine-made stuffs do nowadays.
There were no single sleighs, no
tiny, toy-like things made to display
the rich toilet of the occupant
and the skill of the fast driver
by her side; here all were honest
family vehicles, full of rosy
faces like Christmas apples; hearty
men and women who at three-score
were almost as young as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
their grandchildren on their bridal
day; and young men and maidens
who were not afraid to dance
and move briskly in their plain,
loose, home-spun and home-made
clothes, nor to fall in love with
German downrightness and honest,
practical intentions. Most of
these sleighs were red, picked
out with black, or black liberally
sprinkled with red; some
were yellow and black, some yellow
and blue, and in most the robe
and cushions were of corresponding
colors. Some of these robes
had eagles embroidered in coarse
patterns and thick wool, while others
were of a pattern something
like those used for bed-quilts; and
some bore unmistakable witness to
the thrift of the house-mother, and
were skilfully pieced together out
of carpet, curtain, blanket, and
dress remnants, the whole bordered
with some inexpensive fur. One
or two sleighs bore a sort of figure-head&mdash;the
head of a deer, or a fox,
or a hawk&mdash;carved and let into
the curling part of the front; while
one party, who were gazed upon
with mingled admiration and disapproval,
went so far as to trail
after them, for three or four feet
behind the sleigh, and sweeping
up the snow in their wake, a thick
scarlet cloth of gorgeous appearance,
but no very valuable texture.
This was the doing of a young fellow
who had lately been reading
one or two romances of chivalry,
and been much pleased with the
“velvet housings of the horses,
sweeping the ground as the knight
rode to the king’s tournament.”
His indulgent old mother and admiring
sisters had but faintly remonstrated,
and this was the consequence.
The horses were not
less bedecked than the vehicles.
Silver bells hung from their harness
and belted their bodies in various
places; shining plates of metal
and knobs driven into the leather
made them as gay as circus-horses;
while horse-cloths of variegated
pattern were rolled up under
the feet of their masters, ready for
use whenever they stopped on the
road.</p>

<p>Emanuel himself had gone to
the nearest town at which a stage-coach
stopped, to welcome his wife’s
friend and special guest, and entertained
him with a flow of agricultural
information and warm eulogy of
the country through which they
were speeding on their way home.
He arrived at Stelhagen before the
rush of country visitors, and was
triumphantly taken through every
part of the well-kept farm, while
his meal was being prepared by
Rika and the maids. But more
than all, Frau Köhler, in her delight,
actually made him “free” of
the sacred, secret chamber where
stood the <i lang="de">Christbaum</i>, already laden
but unlighted, among its attendant
tables and dishes. The old man
was as innocently charmed as a
seven-year-old child; it reminded
him so of his own Christmas-tree in
days when the simple customs of
Germany were still unimpaired, and
when it was the fashion to give
only really useful things, with due
regard to the condition and needs
of the recipients.</p>

<p>“But at the feasts to which my
people ask me now,” said he, “I see
children regaled with a multitude
of unwholesome, colored <i lang="fr">bonbons</i>
in boxes that cost quite as much as
the contents, and servants given
cheap silks or paste jewelry, and
the friends or the master and mistress
themselves loaded with pretty
but useless knick-knacks, gilded
toys that cost a great deal and
make more show than their use warrants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
Times are sadly changed,
Thekla, even since you were married.”</p>

<p>“Well, Herr Pfarrer, I have had
little chance, and less wish, to see
the change; and up here I think we
still live as Noah’s sons after they
came out of the ark,” said good
Frau Köhler, with a broad smile at
her own wit. As the day wore on,
she and Rika left the <i lang="de">Pfarrer</i>
(<i lang="fr">curé</i>) to Emanuel’s care, and again
busied themselves about the serious
coming festivity. She flew around,
as active as a fat sparrow, with a
dusting-cloth under her arm, whisking
off with nervous hand every
speck of dust on the mantel-piece
or among the few books which lay
conspicuously on the table in the
best room; giving her orders to the
nimble maids, welcoming the families
of guests, and specially petting
the children. Emanuel took
the men under his protection, and
gave them tobacco and pipes, and
talked farming to them, while his
own young home-squad whispered
in corners of the coming tree and
supper.</p>

<p>At last Rika came out from the
room where the mystery was going
on, and, opening the door wide,
let a flood of light into the dark
apartment beyond. There was a
regular blaze. The large tree stood
on a low table, and reached nearly
up to the ceiling. There were
only lights, colored ribbons, and
gilded walnuts hung upon it, but
it quite satisfied the expectation of
the good folk around it. Round
the room were tables and stands
of all kinds, crowded together, and
barely holding all the dishes apportioned
to each member of the party.
The guests had secretly brought
or sent their mutual presents; one
family generally taking charge of its
neighbor’s gifts, and <i lang="la">vice-versa</i>, that
none might suspect the nature of
their own. The tree, too, was a
joint contribution of the several
families; all had sent in tapers and
nuts, and this it was that made it
so full of bright things and necessitated
its being so tall.</p>

<p>On the middle table, under the
tree itself, were dishes for the Köhler
household, each one having a liberal
allowance of apples, nuts, and
gingerbread. Besides these, there
were parcels, securely tied, laid by
the dishes, and labelled with the
names of their unconscious owners.
Köhler was seized upon by his wife
and daughter before anyone else was
allowed to go forward&mdash;for in this
old-fashioned neighborhood the
head of the house is still considered
in the light of an Abraham&mdash;and a
compact parcel was put into his
hands by Rika, while Thekla kissed
him with hearty loudness. Next
came the guest, whom Rika led to
the prettiest china dish, and presented
with a small, tempting-looking
packet. Leaving him to open
it at his leisure, she joined her
young friends, and a good-natured
scramble now began, each looking
for his own name in some familiar
handwriting, finding it, and opening
the treasure with the eagerness
of a child. It would be impossible
to describe every present that thus
came to view; but though many
were pretty and elaborate, none
were for mere show. Presently
Frau Köhler was seen to take possession
of her husband, and, pulling
off his coat, made him try on the
dressing-gown he had just drawn
from his parcel. She turned him
round like a doll, and clapped her
hands in admiration at the perfect
fit; then danced around to the
other end of the room, and called
out to the maids:</p>

<p>“Lina! Bettchen! it is your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
turn now; you have not been forgotten.
Those are your dishes
where the silver dollars are sticking
in the apples.” The maids opened
their parcels, and each found a
bright, soft, warm dress, crimson
and black. Then came George,
the man who did most of the immediate
work round the house, and
found a bright red vest with steel
buttons in his parcel. Frau Köhler
was busy looking at other people’s
things, when her husband
slipped a neat, long packet on her
dish, and, as she turned and saw
the addition, she uttered an exclamation
of joy. Rika helped her
to unfold the stiff, rustling thing,
when it turned out to be a black
silk dress. Not every housewife in
those days had one, and her last
was nearly worn out. Then the
old priest came forward to show
the company his Christmas box;
and what do you think it was?
There was no doubt as to where it
came from. It was a set of missal-markers,
and in such taste as was
scarcely to be expected in that
time and neighborhood. Rika had
designed it, and her mother had
worked it; but many an anxious
debate had there been over it, as
the Frau Inspectorin had been at
first quite vexed at what she called
its plainness. It was composed of
five thick <i lang="fr">gros-grain</i> ribbons, two
inches wide and fifteen long.
There was a red, a green, a white,
a purple, and a black ribbon; and
on each was embroidered a motto&mdash;on
the red and green, in gold; on
the white, in red; and on the black
and purple, in silver. The letters
were German, though the mottoes
were in Latin, and each of the
five referred to one of these events:
our Lord’s birth, death, Resurrection,
and Ascension, and the Coming
of the Holy Ghost. At the end
of each ribbon, instead of fringe or
tassels, hung a cross of pure silver,
into the ring of which the ribbon
was loosely gathered. Every one
crowded round this novel Christmas
gift, and examined it with an admiration
equally gratifying to the giver
and the receiver. But Emanuel’s
jolly voice soon broke the spell
by saying:</p>

<p>“These fine presents are very
delightful to receive, no doubt, and
the women-folk would not have
been happy without some such
thing; but we are all mortal, and I
have not forgotten that my guest
has feet and hands, and needs
warmth and comfort as much as we
of grosser clay.”</p>

<p>And with this he thrust a large
parcel into the <i lang="de">Pfarrer’s</i> arms.
Every one laughed and helped him
to open it; every one was curious
to see its contents. They were, indeed,
of a most substantial and
useful kind: a foot-muff of scarlet
cloth, lined and bordered with fur,
and a pair of huge sealskin gloves.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the parcel been
opened when a hum of measured
sound was heard outside, and presently
a Christmas carol was distinctly
audible. Everyone knew the words,
and many joined in the song before
the singers became visible. Then
the door opened, and a troop of
children came in, dressed in warm
white furs and woollen wrappings,
and carrying tapers and fir-branches
in their hands. They
sang a second carol, quaint and
rustic in its words, but skilfully set
to anything but archaic music, and
then, in honor of their southern
guest, they began <em>the</em> song of the
evening, a few stanzas from the
“Great Hymn” to the Blessed Virgin,
by the Minnesinger, Gottfried of
Strasburg, the translation of which,
according to Kroeger, runs thus:</p>

<p>“You are not so utterly unknowing
of all gentle and learned pursuits
as you would have had me
believe,” said the <i lang="de">Pfarrer</i> to Frau
Köhler. “It is not every child in
Bavaria that could sing so well this
Old-World poem, so graceful in its
rhyming and so devout in its allusions.
Our old XIIth-century poetry,
the most national&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, peculiar
to our country&mdash;is too much superseded
by noisy modern rhymes
or sentimental ballads copied from
foreign models. Have you any unknown
scholar among your farmers
and agents, who, you told me, made
up a hearty but not a learned society
here?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Frau Köhler, “there
is the school-master, Heldmann,
who is always poring over old useless
books, but never can have a
good dinner unless his friends send
it to him, poor man! He is a bachelor,
and cannot afford to have a
housekeeper. And then there is
one of our young gentlemen, who
Köhler says is always in the clouds,
and who spends all his spare time
with Heldmann, while the other
boys spend theirs with their pretty,
rosy neighbors. By the way, Heldmann
is coming to-night; but he
said he could not come till late, as
he had some important business
which would detain him for an hour
or two.”</p>

<p>“You forget our Rika, mother,”
said Emanuel, not heeding the last
part of his wife’s sentence; “she is as
wise as any of them, though she says
so little. She knows all the old
legends and poetry, and more besides,
I warrant.”</p>

<p>“Rika designed that missal-marker,”
said the Frau Inspectorin
proudly (she had found out, since
it had been so admired, that her
daughter’s instinct had guided her
aright in the design).</p>

<p>But Rika, hearing her name mentioned,
had slipped away among
the white-wrapped children, and
was laying their tapers and fir-branches
away, preparatory to giving
them cakes and fruit. This was
quite a ceremony, and when they
were ready Frau Köhler, handing
the large dish of nuts to the <i lang="de">Pfarrer</i>,
begged him to distribute them, while
she took charge of the gingerbread
and Rika of the apples.</p>

<p>It was funny to see the solemn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
expectancy with which the children
brought out dishes, mugs, pitchers,
etc., in which to receive these
Christmas gifts. Some of the girls
held out their aprons, as more convenient
and capacious receptacles
than anything else they could lay
hands on. One boy brought a
large birthday cup, and another a
wooden milk-bowl; another a small
churn, while a fourth had carried
off his father’s peck-measure, and a
fifth calmly handed up a corn-sack,
which he evidently expected to get
filled to the brim. As Frau Köhler
came to one of the children, she
said:</p>

<p>“Fritz, I saw you in the orchard
last autumn stealing our apples.
Now, naughty boys must not expect
to get apples at Christmas if they
take them at other times; so, Rika,
don’t give him any. He shall have
one piece of gingerbread, though.”
A piteous disclaimer met this sentence;
but the <i lang="de">Pfarrer</i> thrust a
double quantity of nuts into the
culprit’s basket, and passed on.
Then once again Frau Köhler stopped
and said; “Johann, didn’t I
see you fighting with another boy
in the churchyard two weeks ago,
and told you that Santa Claus
would forget you when he came
to fill the stockings on Christmas
night? I shall not give you any
gingerbread.”</p>

<p>“Franz knows we made it up
again,” whined the boy, and Franz,
with a roguish look, peeped out
from his place in the row and said:
“Yes, we did, Frau Inspectorin”;
so both got their gingerbread. At
last, this distribution being over,
the children, laden with their gifts,
went home to their own various
firesides, not without many thanks
to the “stranger within the gates”
and his parting reminder, as he
showed them the stars:</p>

<p>“Look up at God’s own Christmas-tree,
lighted up with thousands
of tapers, children, and at
the smooth, white snow spread over
the fields. That is the white table-cloth
which he has spread for the
beautiful gifts which spring, and
summer, and autumn are going to
bring you, all in his own good
time.”<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>Then came another batch of visitors&mdash;the
old, sick, and infirm people
of the village; the spinning-women,
the broom-tyers, the wooden
bowl and spoon carvers, and
the makers of wooden shoes; and
some who could no longer work,
but had been faithful and industrious
in their time. They had something
of the old costume on: the
men wore blue yarn stockings and
stout gray knee-breeches (they had
left their top-boots outside; for the
snow was deep and soft, and they
needed them all the winter and
through most of the spring); and
the women had large nodding caps
and black silk handkerchiefs folded
across their bosoms. Each of
these old people got a large loaf of
plain cake and some good stout
flannel; and these things, according
to the local etiquette, the inspector
himself delivered to them as the
representative of his young master.
This distribution was an old custom
on the Stelhagen estate, and,
though the present owner was careless
enough in many things, he
wished this usage to be always
kept up. Even if he had not, it is
not likely that as long as Köhler
was inspector the old people would
not have been able to rely on the
customary Christmas gift. After
this some bustle occurred, and
two or three people went and stationed
themselves outside the door.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
Presently the expectant company
within were startled by a loud rap,
and the door flew open, a parcel
was flung in, and a voice cried out:</p>

<p>“Yule rap!”</p>

<p>This was a pair of slippers for
the inspector. No one knew where
they came from; no one had sent
them. Yule raps are supposed to
be magical, impersonal causes of
tangible effects; so every one looked
innocent and astonished, as became
good Mecklenburgers under
Christmas circumstances.</p>

<p>“Yule rap!” again, and the door
opened a second time; a smoking-cap,
embroidered with his initials,
was evolved out of a cumbrous
packet by one of the young apprentices,
and scarcely had he put it
on than another thundering knock
sounded on the door.</p>

<p>“Yule rap!” was shouted again,
and in flew a heavy package. It
was a book, with illustrations of
travel scenes in the East, and was
directed to Rika.</p>

<p>“Yule rap!”</p>

<p>This time it was only a little
square envelope, with a ticket referring
Frau Köhler to another
ticket up in the bureau drawer in
her bedroom; but when one of the
boys found it, that referred again
to another ticket in the cellar; and
when another boy brought this to
light, it mysteriously referred her
to her husband’s pocket. Here, at
last, the hidden thing was revealed&mdash;an
embroidered collar, and a pair
of larger cuffs to match. Köhler
had no idea what sprite had put it
there, so he said.</p>

<p>“Yule rap!” and this time it
was for the guest&mdash;a black velvet
skull-cap, warm and clinging. Then
came various things, all heralded
by the same warning cry of “Yule
rap!” and a knock at the door, generally
in George’s strong voice.
The two maids got the packages
ready, and peeped in at the keyhole
to see when it was time to
vary the sensation by throwing in
another present. Again, a breakfast-bell
came rolling in, ringing as it
bounded on, with just a few bands
of soft stuff and silver paper muffling
its sound. Once a large meerschaum
pipe was laid gently at the
threshold of the door, and one of
the apprentices fetched it as carefully.
Then a violin was pushed
through the half-open door, and
the eager face of the one for whom
it was intended peeped anxiously
over his neighbor’s shoulder, wondering
if any one else were the happy
destined one, and as much surprised
as delighted when he found
it was himself. That violin has
since been heard in many a large
and populous town, and, though its
owner did not become as world-known
as Paganini or Sivori, he did
not love his art less faithfully and
exclusively. We cannot enumerate
all the gifts which Yule brought
round this year; but before the
evening was over, a different voice
cried out the magic words, “Yule
rap!” and the door being slightly
opened and quickly closed again,
a tiny, white, silky dog stood trembling
on the carpet. Rika jumped
up and ran to take it in her arms;
then pulling open the door, “Herr
Heldmann! Herr Heldmann!” she
cried. “I know it is you!”</p>

<p>The schoolmaster came forward,
his rough face glowing with the cold
through which he had just come.</p>

<p>“I promised you a dog, Rika,”
he said rather awkwardly, “but
they would not let me have it till
this very day, and I had no time to
go for it but this evening. I kept
it under my coat all the time; so it
is quite warm. It is only two
months old.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span></p>

<p>Rika was in ecstasies. She declared
this was worth all her Christmas
presents, and then rewarded
Herr Heldmann by telling him how
well the children had done their
part, and how delightfully surprised
the <i lang="de">Pfarrer</i> had been. The two
men were soon in a deep conversation
on subjects dear and familiar
to both, and the company gradually
dissolved again into little knots and
groups. Many took their leave, as
their homes were distant and they
did not wish to be too late; but for
all an informal supper was laid in
the vast kitchen, and by degrees
most of the good things on the
table were sensibly diminished.
The host’s wife and daughter, and
the Herr Pfarrer, with half a dozen
others and a few children, did not
leave the Christmas-tree, whose
tapers were constantly attended
to and replaced when necessary.
Other “Christmas candles” were
also lighted&mdash;tall columns of yellow
wax, made on purpose for this occasion.
As the household and its
inmates were left to themselves, the
children began asking for their accustomed
treat&mdash;the stories that all
children have been fond of since
the world began. No land is so
rich in the romance of childhood
as Germany, both north and south.
There everything is personified, and
as an English writer lately said, wonderful
histories are connected with
the fir-trees in the forests, the beloved
and venerated <i lang="de">Christbaum</i>.
“Though it be yet summer, the
child sees in fancy the beautiful
<i lang="de">Weihnachtsbaum</i>, adorned with
sparkling things as the Gospel, is
adorned with promises and hopes;
rich in gifts as the three kings were
rich; pointing to heaven as the
angel pointed; bright as those very
heavens were bright with silver-winged
messengers; crowned with
gold as the Word was crowned;
odorous like the frankincense:
sparkling like the star; spreading
forth its arms, full of peace and
good-will on every side, holding out
gifts and promises for all.”</p>

<p><i lang="de">Weihnacht</i>, the blessed, the hallowed,
the consecrated night, is the
child-paradise of Germany. That
land of beautiful family festivals has
given Christmas a double significance,
and merged into its memories
all the graceful, shadowy legends
of the dead mythology of the
Fatherland. The German child is
reared in the midst of fairy-tales,
which are only truths translated into
child-language. Besides the old
standard ones, every neighborhood
has its own local tales, every family
its own new-born additions or inventions.
Every young mother,
herself but a step removed from
childhood, with all her tender imaginations
still stirring, and her
child-days lifted into greater beauty
because they are but just left behind,
makes new stories for her little
ones, and finds in every flower a new
fairy, in every brook a new voice.</p>

<p>And yet the old tales still charm
the little ones, and the yearly coming
of King Winter brings the old,
worn stories round again. So
Emanuel Köhler told the fairy-tale
which the children had listened to
every Christmas with ever-new delight,
about the journey of King
Winter from his kingdom at the
North Pole, and how he put on his
crown with tall spikes of icicles, and
wrapped himself in his wide snow-mantle,
which to him is as precious
and as warm as ermine.</p>

<p>“And now,” said the host, “there
is some one here who can tell you
a far more beautiful story than mine.
Some One, greater than the Winter-King,
comes too every year&mdash;a snow-Child,
the white Christ whom our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
ancestors, the old Norse and Teutonic
warriors, learned to see and
adore, where they had only seen
and worshipped the God of War and
the God of Thunder before. Ask
him to tell you a story.”</p>

<p>And the old, white-haired <i lang="de">Pfarrer</i>
stroked the head of the child nearest
to him, as the little one looked
shyly up into his face, mutely endorsing
Emanuel’s appeal. He told
them that they must already know
the story of the first Christmas
night, and so he would only tell them
how the news that the angels told
the shepherds on the hills came
long centuries after to others as
pure-minded as the shepherds, and
by means almost as wonderful. He
repeated to them from memory the
words of an English prose-poet,
which he said he had loved ever
since he came across them, and
which made the picture he best
loved to talk on at Christmas-time:
“That little infant frame, white as
a snow-drop on the lap of winter,
light almost as a snow-flake on the
chill night air, smooth as the cushioned
drift of snow which the wind
has lightly strewn outside the walls
of Bethlehem, is at this moment
holding within itself, as if it were of
adamantine rock, the fires of the
beatific light.… The little
white lily is blooming below the
greater one; an offshoot of its stem,
and a faithful copy, leaf for leaf,
petal for petal, white for white,
powdered with the same golden
dust, meeting the morning with the
same fragrance, which is like no
other than their own!”<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>There was a more marvellous tale
than any they had heard about
talking-flowers. The <i lang="de">Christkind</i>
was a flower, and his blessed
Mother was a flower&mdash;holy lilies
in the garden of God, blossoming
rods like Aaron’s, fruitful roots,
stately cedars, and fruit-giving palm-trees.
It was a very happy thing
to know and feel all this, as we do;
but many millions of men know
nothing of it, and centuries ago
even our forefathers in these forests
knew nothing of it. “But,” he
continued, “there was a distant island,
where men of our race lived,
which did not receive the faith till
long after Germany and France
and Britain were Christian, and
even had cathedrals and cloisters
and schools in abundance. It was
two hundred years after Charlemagne,
who was a Frankish, and
therefore a German, sovereign,
founded the Palatine schools and
conferred with the learned English
monk, Alcuin. This distant, pagan
island was Iceland. The Norsemen
there were a wild, fierce, warlike
people, free from any foreign government,
and just the kind of heroes
that their old mythology represented
them as becoming in their
future, disembodied life. They
had their scalds, or saga-men, their
bards, who were both poets and
historians, who kept up their spirit
by singing wild songs about their
ancestors and the battles they had
won. They were all pagans, and
thought the forgiveness of injuries
very mean. Well, one day, the eve
of Yule-tide, when it was terribly
cold and cheerless, an old scald
sat in his rough hut, with a flickering
light before him, chanting one
of his wild, heathen songs, and his
daughter, a beautiful girl, sat at the
plank table near him, busy with
some woman’s work. During an
interval of his song she raised her
eyes and said to him:</p>

<p>“‘Father, there must be something
beyond all that&mdash;something
greater and nobler.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Why, child,’ said the old man,
with a kind of impatient wonder,
‘why should you think so? Many
things different there may be, just
as there are different kinds of men,
and different kinds of beasts, and
different kinds of plants; some for
mastery and some for thraldom;
some for the chase, and some for
the kitchen or the plough; some
for incantations and sacrifices, and
some for common food. But anything
nobler than our history there
could not be; and as for our religion,
if there were anything different,
or even better, it would not
suit our people, and so would be no
concern of ours.’</p>

<p>“‘But if it were true, father, and
ours not true, what then?’</p>

<p>“‘Why ask the question, child?
What was good enough for the wise
and brave Northmen who fled here
that they might be free to fight and
worship according to their fancy,
is good enough for their descendants.’</p>

<p>“‘But you know yourself, father,’
persisted the maiden, ‘that those
whom our poetical traditions call
gods were men, heroes and patriots
who taught our forefathers various
arts, and guided them safely
across deserts and through forests
in their long, long migration&mdash;but
still only men. Our chieftains of
to-day might as well become gods
to our great-grandchildren, if the
old leaders have become so to us.
Wise as they were, they could not
command the frozen seas to open
a way for their ships, nor make the
sun rise earlier in the long winter,
nor compel the cutting ice-wind to
cease. If they could not do such
things, they must have been very
far from gods.’</p>

<p>“‘It is true,’ said the old man,
‘that those great chieftains were,
in the dim ages we can scarcely
count back to, men like us; but
the gods who taught them those
very arts took them up to live with
them as long as their own heaven
might last, and made them equal to
themselves. You know even Paradise
itself is to come to an end
some day.’</p>

<p>“‘So our legends say, father;
but that, too, makes it seem as if
these gods were only another order
of mortal beings, stronger but not
better than we are, and hiding from
us the true, changeless heaven far
above them. For surely that which
changes cannot be divine. And
then our legends say that evil is to
triumph when heaven and earth
come to an end. True, they say
there will be a renewal of all things
after that, and that, no doubt,
means that good will be uppermost;
very likely all the things
spoken of in our Eddas are only
signs of other things which we
could not understand.’</p>

<p>“The daughter continued these
questionings and speculations, the
scald answering them as best he
could.</p>

<p>“He had listened with evident
admiration and approval to her impassioned
speech, but he was willing
to test her faith in her own womanhood
to the utmost. She now
seemed wrapt in her own thoughts,
but after a short pause said:</p>

<p>“‘It would not be another’s inspiration
in which I should believe;
it would be a message from Him
who has put this belief already into
my heart. Some One greater than
all has spoken to my inmost heart,
and I am ready to believe; but the
messenger that is to put it into
words and tell me what to do has
not come.’</p>

<p>“There was a silence, and the
wind and the sea roared without.
The old man shaded the flickering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
light with his hand, and gazed
at his daughter, who was sitting
with her hands clasped in her lap.
He thought that she herself must
have received some divine illumination;
for the Norsemen believed in
the prophetic gifts of some of their
women. His own mind, more cultivated
than that of the warrior’s,
saw through the symbolic character
of many of the very myths he sang,
and tended vaguely to belief in a
higher and hidden circle of things
infinite, true, and eternal. But
then the northern mind was naturally
simple, not prone to metaphysical
distinctions, not analytical
and subtle, dividing as with the
sword that pierceth between soul
and spirit; and the old man saw no
use in raising theological problems
for which he could offer no rational
solution, save through the dreams
of a young girl. Presently the old
man rose, shaking off his meditations,
and said:</p>

<p>“‘It is time for me to go to the
Yule-night festival, and I shall
have a stormy trudge of it to the
castle. I must leave you alone
here till to-morrow night. But, my
child, I know that there is safety
for the scald’s daughter wherever
she may be; the very sea would
not hurt her, and the wildest men
would kneel before her; so farewell,
and a father’s blessing be upon
you.’</p>

<p>“His daughter rose and fetched
his cloak and staff, wrapped the
former around him, and fastened it
over the rude musical instrument
that answered the purpose of lyre
and harp; but I am not very learned
in such things, and cannot tell
you exactly what it was. The
young girl stood long on the threshold
of the hut, shading the light,
and looking out after her father into
the darkness. The wind was
sharp and icy, and blew from the
frozen sea. As she held the light,
she thought she heard a cry come
from the direction of the sea. She
lingered before closing the door,
although the wind was very chill;
for the cry seemed repeated, and
she thought it was a human voice
calling. A moment’s reflection told
her it could not be so; for the whole
sea was frozen for miles outward,
and no boat or wreck could come
so near land. She sat down again
to her work, and mused on the conversation
she had held with her
father. He had studied their national
books all his life, and she was
not yet twenty. He must know
best. Was she likely to be right?
She had little experience of the way
in which the old system worked;
only her own dreams and fancies
showed her any other possibility;
and yet&mdash;she could not shake off
the thought: she thirsted for another
revelation. The far-off, unknown
Godhead must have some means
of communicating with men; why
should he not speak to her, who
so passionately and blindly longed
for a message, a command, from
him?</p>

<p>“The cry from the sea sounded
again. Surely, this time there
could be no mistake; the voice was
human, and it had come nearer
since she had left the door. She
took up the light again, and went
outside, shouting as loud as she
could in return. She was answered,
and a strange awe came upon her
as she heard this cry. Was it that
of a man or a spirit? The latter
supposition seemed to her unsophisticated
mind quite as likely as the
former, but it did not frighten her,
as it would most of her countrywomen.
She went in again, wrapped
a thick fur cloak around her,
and, taking another on her arm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
sallied out once more with another
stronger light. It was barely
possible to keep the resinous torch
alight, and she looked anxiously
out towards the sea, to try and
catch some glimpse of a human
figure. The cries came again at intervals;
but she knew that in the clear
air a seemingly near sound might
yet be far distant. She had to walk
briskly up and down the shore, in
the beaten path between walls of
snow, to keep herself warm, and occasionally
she lifted the flaring
torch and waved it as a signal. She
could do no more, but she longed
to see her unknown visitor, and to
go out to meet him on the frozen
waters. Was it some wrecked sailor,
who had clambered from ice-floe
to ice-floe, in the desperate
hope of reaching land before he
died of cold and hunger, or some
unearthly messenger from an invisible
world? If he were a mere man,
from what coast could he have
drifted. No Icelander would be out
at this time and place; it was Yule-tide,
and there were no wandering
boats out among the ice-cliffs and
floes. At last she thought she
could discern a shadowy form,
blacker than the surrounding darkness,
but surely no human form; it
was like a moving cross, one upright
shape, and one laid across near the
top, and both dark and compact.
But the cry was repeated, though in
a more assured and joyful tone, and
the maiden waited with bated breath,
wondering what this marvel could
mean. A field of unbroken ice
stretched between her and the advancing
figure, which now hastened
its steps, and came on like a swift-sailing
bird, cleaving the darkness.
She thought she could distinguish
a human face above the junction of
the two arms of the cross, and she
held up the light, still uncertain
what kind of visitant this approaching
form might be. At last it
flashed upon her that it was a man
bearing a child. But why so rigid?
Why did he not hug him close to
his bosom to keep him warm, to
keep him alive? Was the child
dead? And a shuddering awe
came upon her, as she thought of
its dead white face upturned to
heaven, and of the faithful man who
had not forsaken it, or left it to the
seals and wolves on the ice, or
buried it in the chill waters beneath
the ice-floes. What a cold it
must have struck to the heart of the
man carrying it; how his hands
must be well-nigh frozen in supporting
this strange burden!</p>

<p>“She hardly knew whether she
was still imagining what might be,
or witnessing real movements, when
the figure came straight up to her,
and, stooping, laid the child at her
feet. She lowered the torch, and,
as the glare fell on the little face,
she saw that it was no breathing
one; the man had sunk down beside
it, hardly able to stir, now the supreme
effort was over and his end
was accomplished. She dropped
the cloak she held over the little
body, and caught up a handful of
snow, wherewith she energetically
rubbed the face and hands of the
stranger, then half dragged, half
supported him to the door of the
hut. He had only spoken once,
just as he dropped at her feet, but
she did not understand him: he
spoke in a foreign tongue. Once
more she went out and brought in
the stiffened, frozen body of the
child, which she laid on a fur robe
just outside the hut; for it was
warm within the small, confined
dwelling. It was an hour before
the stranger’s eye told her that her
simple, quick remedies had succeeded.
He was not very tall, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
immensely strong and powerful,
and there was a fire in his dark
gray eye that gave the clew to his
strange, weird pilgrimage over the
ice-floes. His hair was dark brown,
with a reddish tinge, but already
mixed with a few gray streaks; it
had been shorn close to his head
some time since, as appeared from
its irregular growth at present.
Beneath his cloak he wore a long
black robe, with a leathern girdle
round the waist. The child was
very beautiful, even in death; his
eyes were closed, but his black,
curling hair hung round his neck,
and the lips had a sweet though
somewhat proud outline. The
scald’s daughter set some simple
food before her silent guest, and
made him a sign to eat. He was
evidently very hungry, but before
he began he moved his lips and
made the sign of the cross on his
forehead, lips, and breast. She asked
him in her own language what
that ceremony meant, not hoping
to make him understand her speech,
but trusting to her inquiring looks
for some explanatory sign that she
might interpret as best she could
to herself. To her surprise, he
answered in a few, slow, labored
words, not in Icelandic to be sure,
but in some dialect akin to it; for
she could make out the meaning.
It was, in fact, the Norse dialect
that was spoken in the Orkney Islands,
but she did not know that.
As he spoke, her guest pointed
upwards, and she knew that he referred
to God. A great longing
came into her heart, and she asked
again if his God were the same
the Icelanders worshipped. He
shook his head, and she eagerly
questioned farther, but grew so
voluble that he could not follow
her, and the conversation ceased.
Then the stranger rose and went
out to the little corpse, which he
addressed in impassioned terms
in his own language, making over
it the same sign that had drawn
the maiden’s attention before.
He then described to her&mdash;mostly
in pantomime, and with a few
Norse words to help him on, and
a few slowly-pronounced questions
on her part&mdash;how the boy and
he had been in a boat that was
wrecked many days’ journey from
their own country, and how he
had carried him and fed him for
three or four days, and then seen
him die in his arms. The boy was
the only son of a great chief, and
he was taking him to his uncle in
the North of Scotland. His own
country was south of Scotland, a
large island like Iceland, but green
and beautiful, and there was no
ice there.</p>

<p>“The girl made him understand
that she was alone for a day or two,
but when her father came back he
would help him. He evidently
understood her better than she did
him.</p>

<p>“The next morning, when she
again set food before him, she imitated
his sign of the cross, and
said she wished to believe in the
true God; and if his God were the
true one, she would believe in him.
She looked so earnest and anxious
that he again began to try to explain;
but the few words he could
command, though they sufficed to
hint at his worldly adventures, and
made clear to her that he had been
wrecked, were scarcely adequate
to tell her of the new religion she
longed to understand.</p>

<p>“But at noon that day another
guest and traveller passed by the
scald’s dwelling. He was hurrying
to the same castle where the girl’s
father had gone in his capacity of
minstrel, but a violent snow-storm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
had come on that morning, and he
had lost his way. He stopped a
moment to refresh himself, and noticed
the stranger. He was himself
known as a great traveller, and the
figure in the coarse black robe
seemed not unfamiliar to him. He
addressed the stranger in the latter’s
language, guessing him at once
to be an Irish monk. He said he
had seen such men in the Scottish
islands, where he had been storm-driven
with his ship two years ago,
and he had picked up a little of
their speech. When the maiden
discovered that in this stray guest
she had found an interpreter, she
pressed him, implored him, almost
commanded him, to stay.</p>

<p>“‘I must ask him the questions
my father could not solve yesterday,’
she said; ‘and my father’s
friend will not refuse to speak in
my name, for I believe that the unknown
God has answered my
prayer in sending this holy man
over the sea to my very feet.’
And she told him how the stranger
had come to her, out of the darkness,
in the shape of a cross&mdash;the
same sign he made to propitiate his
God.</p>

<p>“‘Ask him to tell us what he believes,’
she said impetuously; and
the interpreter, compelled by some
instinct that he could not resist,
began his office willingly.</p>

<p>“‘Tell him,’ she said, ‘that yesterday,
before he came, I was all
day thinking that the high, true,
unknown God had a message for
me, and a truer faith to teach me,
because he had put into my heart
a longing for something higher than
what our books and songs have
taught us. And tell him that I believe
God sent him in answer to
my doubts and prayers.’</p>

<p>“‘The traveller faithfully translated
all this. The monk’s face
glowed as he replied, in his own
language, which he used with the
grace and skill of a poet:</p>

<p>“‘Tell the maiden that she is
right; the true God <em>did</em> send me,
and now I know why such things
happened to me; why I was wrecked
with my lord’s only son, a precious
freight, a sacred deposit, which the
Lord of lords has now taken upon
himself to account for to the earthly
father, bereaved of his one hope.
But God sent me here because to
this pure-hearted virgin I was to
explain the faith he had already
put into her heart. It is not I who
bring her the true faith, but God
himself who has spoken to her and
inclined her to believe; me he has
sent to put this message into practical
form. Tell her that this is the
birthday of the Lord, and that a
thousand years ago, almost at the
same hour when I set my dead burden
at her feet, a living Child,
God’s own Child, lay at the feet of
a pure Virgin in a little village far
away in the land of the rising sun.
And as this maiden’s torch which I
saw over the wild, frozen sea, and
followed, was an emblem of the
faith that dwelt already in her
heart, so, too, a marvellous star led
three wise men, the scalds of the
East, to where this Child lay, and
the star was the emblem of their
firm faith, which led them to cross
rivers and deserts to reach the
Child. And tell her that the way
in which this wonderful birth was
celebrated was by a song which
held all the essence of truth in it:
“Glory to God on high, and on
earth peace to men of good-will.”’</p>

<p>“All this the interpreter told the
maiden, and both marvelled at it.
The stranger told them more and
more of that wonderful tale, so
familiar to us, but which once sounded
to our warlike forefathers like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
the foolishness of babes and sucklings,
or at most like some Eastern
myth good enough for philosophers
to wrangle over, but unfit for sturdy
men of the forest. To the Icelandic
maiden it seemed but the fulfilment
of her own dreams; and as
she listened to the story of the Child,
grown to be a wise but obedient
Boy, and then a wandering, suffering
Man, her soul seemed to drink in
the hidden grandeur of the relation,
to pierce beyond the human stumbling-blocks
which confronted the
wise and learned of other lands,
and go at once to the heart of the
great mystery of love, personified
in the Man-God. All the rest
seemed to her to be the fitting garment
of the central mystery, the
crown of leaves growing from the
fruitful trunk of this one doctrine.
All day long the three sat together,
the two Icelanders hanging on the
words of the stranger; and so the
scald found them on his return.
He, too, wanted to know the news
which the monk had brought; for
he said he had always believed
that behind their national songs
and hymns lay something greater,
but perhaps not expedient for
Norsemen to know. He shook his
head sadly when he learned the
monk’s precepts of love, peace,
mercy, and forgiveness, and said
he feared his countrymen would
not understand that, but for his
part it was not uncongenial to him.
As the weather was such that no
vessel could put to sea before
the ice broke up, he constrained
the monk to stay the rest of the
winter with him, and in the spring
promised to go over with him to
the nearest Scottish coast, and carry
the body of his little charge to
the uncle to whom he had been on
his way when he was wrecked.</p>

<p>“Before the New Year began,
the monk baptized the first Icelandic
convert, the daughter of the
scald, and gave her the name of the
Mother of the Babe of Bethlehem,
Mary. Many others heard of the
new religion before he left, but that
does not belong to my story. The
new convert and her father accompanied
him to Scotland, and were
present at the burial of the Irish
chieftain’s son at the castle of his
Scottish uncle. The latter’s son
married the Norse maiden, but she
never ceased to lament that it had
not been given to her to convert
many of her own countrymen, or at
least shed her blood for her new
faith. All her life long she helped
to send missionaries to Iceland; and
when her son grew up to manhood,
the palm she coveted was awarded
to him, for he went to his mother’s
native country, founded a monastery
there, labored among the people,
converted many, and taught reading
and the arts of peace as well as the
faith to his pupils; became abbot
of the monastery, and was finally
martyred on the steps of the altar
by a horde of savage heathen Norsemen.</p>

<p>“This is the best Christmas story
I know, children,” concluded the
Herr Pfarrer; “and you, Rika, I can
wish you no better model than the
fair maiden of Iceland.”</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight when the
old priest finished his tale, and
Frau Köhler, rising, and thanking
him cordially for this unwonted addition
to ordinary Christmas stories,
led him to a door which had been
locked till now. It opened into a
room decked as a chapel, with an
altar at the end, which was now
decorated with evergreens. A few
chairs and benches were ranged before
it, and on a table at the side
was everything in readiness for saying
Mass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is long since I have heard
a midnight Mass,” said the good
hostess, growing suddenly grave and
reverential in her manner, “and
my Rika never has; and you know,
Herr Pfarrer, I told you I had a
greater surprise in store for you yet,
after all the local customs in which
you were so much interested.”</p>

<p>So the beautiful Midnight Mass
was said in the Mecklenburg inspector’s
farm-house, and a more impressive
one Frau Köhler had never
heard in any southern cathedral;
for though there was no music and
no pomp, there brooded over the
little congregation a spirit of reverence
and peace, which comes in full
perfection only through a deep silence.
The hostess and her daughter
received Communion together,
and the attentive household could
not help thinking of the beautiful
Icelandic convert when she came
back from the altar, her hands
folded over her breast, and her long,
fair hair plaited in two plain, thick
tresses.</p>

<p>Herr Heldmann had stayed too,
and from that day he never ceased
his study of theological problems
and his correspondence with the
Herr Pfarrer, till he became a Catholic,
and was married to Rika in
this same little chapel-room a year
later by the same kind old priest.
One of the young apprentices of
Emanuel Köhler had been his secret
rival; but notwithstanding that
Heldmann was ungainly, shy, and
twice her age, Rika decidedly
thought that she had the best of
the bargain.</p>

<p>And it was true; he had a heart
of gold, and she made him a model
wife.</p>

<h3>ANGLICANS, OLD CATHOLICS, AND THE CONFERENCE
AT BONN.</h3>

<p>Under the title of <cite>Anglicanism,
Old Catholicism, and the Union of
the Christian Episcopal Churches</cite>, an
essay has recently been published
by the Rev. Father Tondini,<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Barnabite,
whose intimate acquaintance
with the respective languages
of England, Germany, and Russia,
as well as the religious history and
literature of those countries, peculiarly
qualifies him for dealing with
the questions just now exciting so
much attention in Western Europe.
We shall, therefore, not only make
his treatise, which merits more than
ordinary notice, the basis of the
present article, but shall reproduce
such portions of it as are particularly
suggestive at the present time,
and conclude with some account
of the Conference at Bonn and the
considerations it suggests.</p>

<p>In the Introduction to his
treatise the reverend author gives
the reasons which called it forth,
the last being the promise made on
the tomb of a friend<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> to leave
nothing untried which might promote
the return of the Greco-Russian
Church to Catholic unity; an
unexpected opportunity being given
for fulfilling this promise by the
reference made more than once by
Mr. Gladstone, in his recent publications,
to the organization of the
Eastern as contrasted with that of
the Catholic Church. Moreover,
the sympathy displayed by Mr.
Gladstone for the Old Catholics
and their Conference at Bonn serves
to complete the argument.</p>

<p>There are two passages in Mr.
Gladstone’s <cite>Vaticanism</cite> with which
Father Tondini has more especially
dealt. One is the following:</p>

<p>“Of these early provisions for a
balance of church power, and for
securing the laity against sacerdotal
domination, the rigid conservatism
of the Eastern Church presents us,
even down to the present day, with
an authentic and living record.”<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span></p>

<p>These valuable “provisions” are
set forth at length in the second
edition of a former work by Father
Tondini, <cite>The Pope of Rome and
the Popes of the Oriental Church</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
In a special preface he there says:
“There is much to be learned from
them, especially if we take into
consideration their recent date, and
the ecclesiastical canons of which
the Eastern Church has not been
indeed a rigid conservator.”</p>

<p>In the quotations there given at
length from the original documents,
we find abundant evidence of the
manner in which the ancient canons
have been set aside, wherever
convenient to the czar, for his own
regulations.</p>

<p>The second passage requiring
comment is the following:</p>

<p>“The ancient principles of popular
election and control, for which
room was found in the Apostolic
Church under its inspired teachers,
and which still subsist in the Christian
East.”<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>This, as we shall see, is disposed
of in the third chapter of the present
essay, into which has been collected
trustworthy information as
to the non-popular mode of election
of bishops resorted to in the
Oriental Orthodox Church.<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>Towards the close of the Introduction
the writer remarks that
if the statements made by Mr.
Gladstone respecting the Catholic
Church were true, she could not be
the true church of our Lord, and,
if not, he asks, where then is the
true church to be found? The
Oriental Church could not solve
the question, because she is in contradiction
to the doctrine contained
in her own liturgy,<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> and also for
other reasons, to which for some
years past he has been directing
public attention.<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> There remain
to be considered the Anglican Establishment&mdash;this
being the church
to which belongs the writer who
accuses the Catholic Church of
having changed in faith, and deprived
her children of their moral
and mental freedom&mdash;and the newest
sect of all, namely, the so-called
Old Catholics, owing to the same
writer’s admiration of those who
figure in its ranks.</p>

<p>Reason, so loudly appealed to by
Mr. Gladstone, has been strictly
adhered to by Father Tondini in
his careful examination of the credentials
of the two latter bodies,
and we will give, in as concise a
form as may be consistent with
clearness, the result of his inquiry.
He especially addresses those who
admit the existence of a visible
Church of Christ, and still more
particularly those who, rather than
reconcile themselves to the Catholic
Church, say that neither the
Roman Catholic Church, nor the Anglican
Establishment, nor the Old-Catholic
Society, but the Oriental
Orthodox Church, is the true visible
church of Christ.</p>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p>The claims of the Anglican<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
Church are first examined, her vitality
being an argument that we
are in presence of an institution adhered
to, at least by a large portion
of her members, with conviction
and devotedness, as a valuable medium
between unbelief and superstition,
worldliness and sanctity;
and of a state church as solidly
framed as human genius could devise.</p>

<p>“Bodies,” says Mr. Gladstone,
“are usually held to be bound by
the evidence of their own selected
and typical witnesses.”<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> Now, the
selected and typical witnesses of
the Church of England are the sovereign,
who is “Defender of the
Faith and Supreme Governor of the
Church in her Dominions,” and
the episcopate. If the whole clergy
is consulted, the evidence becomes
as undeniable as it can possibly be.</p>

<p>This perfect evidence is found in
the Thirty-nine Articles, which are
thus headed: “Articles agreed upon
by the archbishops and bishops of
both provinces, and the whole clergy,
assembled in convocation holden
at London in the year 1562, for the
avoiding of diversities of opinions,”
etc., etc.</p>

<p>The Ratification is to the same
effect, with the addition of the
assent and consent of the queen
(Elizabeth), after their final rehearsal
in the General Convocation of
bishops and clergy in 1571. They
are, moreover, reprinted in the <cite>Book
of Common Prayer</cite>, with the Declaration
of King James I. affixed, and
which runs as follows:</p>

<p>“Being by God’s ordinance, according
to our just title, Defender
of the Faith and supreme governor
of the church in these our dominions,
… we will that all curious
search be laid aside, and these
disputes shut up in God’s promises
as they be generally set forth in the
Holy Scriptures, and the general
meaning of the Articles of the
Church of England according to
them; and that no man hereafter
shall either print or preach to draw
the article aside any way, but shall
submit to it in the plain and full
meaning thereof, and … shall
take it in the literal and grammatical
sense.”</p>

<p>“Following this last admonition,
and bearing in mind that the Church
of England considers herself to be
a branch of the universal church
of Christ, we open the <cite>Book of Common
Prayer</cite>, and turn to those
among the Articles which treat of
the universal church, that we may
see how, without renouncing our
Italian nationality&mdash;which to us is
very dear&mdash;we could belong to the
universal church of Christ. We
see an article headed ‘Of the Authority
of General Councils,’ and, on
reading it, find to our astonishment
the definition, not indeed of the infallibility
of the Pope, but of the
fallibility, without any exception, of
the universal church of Christ! It
is: Article XXI.&mdash;‘General Councils
may not be called together without
the commandment and will of
princes. And when they be gathered
together (forasmuch as they
be an assembly of men, whereof all
be not governed with the spirit and
word of God), they may err, and
sometimes have erred, even in
things pertaining unto God. Wherefore
things ordained by them as
necessary to salvation have neither
strength nor authority, unless it may
be declared that they be taken out
of Holy Scripture.’”</p>

<p>“Thus” (we give Father Tondini’s
words) “the Church of England
has defined, in two plenary national
councils, that the universal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
church of Christ, even when assembled
in a general council, may err,
and ordain, as necessary to salvation,
things which have neither
strength nor authority; and a king,
‘Defender of the Faith,’ has declared
that this is the true doctrine
of the Church of England, agreeable
to God’s word, and required all his
loving subjects to submit to this article
‘in the plain and full meaning
thereof,’ and to take it ‘in the literal
and grammatical sense’!</p>

<p>“We can hardly trust our own
eyes. Again: What does the word
‘declare’ mean in the concluding
words of the article? This word
may convey two senses&mdash;that of
proving and of making a declaration.</p>

<p>“In the first case, <em>who</em> is to offer
the proofs that ‘the thing ordained
as necessary to salvation’ is taken
out of Holy Scripture? This the
Church of England has forgotten to
tell us!… Moreover, an
authority whose decrees, in order to
have a binding power, must be proved
to be taken out of Holy Scripture,
is by that very fact subordinate
to those who are called to examine
the proofs.<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> The chief authorities
of the church assembled
in a general council are thus rendered
as inferior to the faithful as
the claimant is inferior to the judge
who is about to pronounce sentence
upon his claims. The teaching
and governing body of the church
is consequently no more than an
assembly commissioned to frame,
‘as necessary to salvation,’ laws to
be submitted to the approbation of
the faithful!</p>

<p>“Is this serious? Is it even respectful
to human intelligence?”</p>

<p>Again, if the word “declare”
must be taken in the sense of a
declaration, Father Tondini asks:
“But by whom is such a declaration
to be made? Assuredly not by the
council itself&mdash;‘judice in causâ propriâ.’
An authority liable to err,
‘even in things pertaining unto
God,’ and to ordain ‘as necessary
to salvation’ things which have
‘neither strength nor authority,’
is liable also to mistake the sense
of Holy Scripture. To seek such
a declaration from this fallible
authority would be like begging
the question.</p>

<p>“The declaration must, then, be
made by some authority external to
the general council. But the ‘archbishops,
bishops, and the whole
clergy of England’ have omitted to
inform the faithful <em>where</em> such an
authority is to be found. Moreover,
since a general council&mdash;that is, the
‘selected and typical witnesses’ of
the whole Church of Christ&mdash;may
err (according to Article XXI.), it
necessarily follows that portions of
the whole church of Christ may
err also. In fact, this natural consequence
is explicitly stated in Article
XIX. The zeal displayed by
the Church of England in asserting
the fallibility, both of the whole
church of Christ and of portions
of that church, may be said to rival
that of the most fervent advocates
of the infallibility of the Pope.”</p>

<p>This XIXth Article modestly asserts
that, “as the Churches of Jerusalem,
Alexandria, and Antioch have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
erred, so also the Church of Rome
hath erred, not only in their living
and manner of ceremonies, but
also in matters of faith.”</p>

<p>Whereupon “a legitimate doubt
arises whether the Church of England,
too, might not have erred in
issuing the Thirty-nine Articles
of Religion. This doubt is very
material. These Articles ordain
several things as ‘necessary to salvation.’
Are they, or are they not,
‘taken out of Holy Scripture’?
Have they, or have they not,
‘strength and authority’?”</p>

<p>Shortly after their promulgation,
we have it upon the authority of
King James I. himself that this
doubt gave rise to “disputations,
altercations, and questions such as
may nourish faction both in the
church and commonwealth,” and
his majesty adds that “therefore,
upon mature deliberation,” etc., he
“thought fit” to make the declaration
following:</p>

<p>“That the Articles of the Church
of England … do contain
the true doctrine of the Church of
England, agreeable to God’s Word,
which <span class="smcapuc">WE</span> do therefore ratify and
confirm.”</p>

<p>“May we” (with Father Tondini)
“be allowed respectfully to ask
whether King James I. was infallible?”</p>

<p>And if so, why should Catholics
be charged with having forfeited
their mental and moral freedom,
etc., etc., because they admit the
infallibility of the Pope, which results,
by the law of development,
from several passages of Holy Scripture;
whereas, on the contrary, no
“brain power” will ever be able to
discover a single word in Holy
Scripture which can, by the most
vigorous process of development,
bud forth into the infallibility of a
King of England?</p>

<p>On the other hand, if King James
were <em>not</em> infallible, by what right
could he then prohibit and <em>will</em> in
matters of faith for his subjects?</p>

<p>His only right was this: that the
Church of England had been made
a powerful <i lang="la">instrumentum regni</i> in
the hands of her sovereigns,<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> just
as the Church of Russia is in the
hands of her czars.</p>

<p>After this, observes the writer, no
inconsistency ought to astonish us.</p>

<p>In Article XVIII. it is declared
that “the body of Christ is given,
taken, and eaten in the [Lord’s]
Supper <em>only after an heavenly and
spiritual manner</em>”; and again, at the
end of the “Order of the Ministration
of the Holy Communion,” that
“the natural body and blood of our
Saviour Christ are in heaven, <em>and not
here</em>.” How can these declarations
be made to agree with the following,
which is taught in the Little
Catechism?&mdash;“The body and
blood of Christ are <em>verily and indeed
taken</em> and received by the faithful
in the Lord’s Supper.”</p>

<p>Again, in Article XI. we find:
“That we are justified by faith
<em>only</em> is a most wholesome doctrine,
and very full of comfort”; whereas
in the order for the visitation
of the sick we read as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here shall the sick person be
moved to make <em>a special confession
of his sins</em>, if he feel his conscience
troubled with any weighty matter.
After which confession the priest
shall absolve him (if he humbly
and heartily desire it) after this
sort,” etc., etc.</p>

<p>“But,” asks Father Tondini,
“by what strange metamorphosis
can the above-quoted doctrine of
justification <em>by faith only</em>, declared
to be ‘most wholesome and very
full of comfort’ while we are in
good health, cease to possess the
power of comforting the conscience
of a sick person? And how can
confession, which through life is
to be considered by Anglicans as
‘<em>grown of the corrupt following of
the apostles</em>’ (see Article XXV.), become
suddenly so transfigured by
the approach of death as to obtain
the power of relieving a conscience
‘troubled with any weighty matter’?”</p>

<p>Although it may not be matter
of much surprise that a church
which has so carefully defined her
own fallibility should have one
doctrine for her children in their
days of health and vigor, and another
for the time of their sickness
and death, still it does surprise
us that a man of education
like Mr. Gladstone should be so
unconscious of his own extraordinary
inconsistency in appealing&mdash;as
he does throughout his attacks
against Catholics and the Catholic
Church&mdash;to “mental and moral
freedom,” “logic,” “consistency
of mind,” “manliness of thought,”
etc., etc.</p>

<p>Already arise from all sides
echoes of the question singularly
enough asked by Mr. Gladstone
himself: “Is the Church of England
worth preserving?”<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>“The Church of England,” said
Laud, “is Protestant.” And Mr.
Gladstone, true to “the church of
his birth and his country,” protests,
like her, against the church
which made his country a Christian
nation. The Ritualists, the latest
sect within her, still boast that they
“help to keep people from the
Church of Rome,” and reject the
imputation of sympathy with her
as an insupportable calumny.<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>
“They will give communion in
Westminster Abbey to an Unitarian,
flatter Jansenists and Monophysites,
remain in communion with
bishops whom they themselves proclaim
to be heretics; but one thing
they will not do&mdash;tolerate the creed
of the church to which they owe
every fragment and crumb of truth
that remains to them.” “Take
the great Anglian divines,” writes
Mr. Marshall: “Bull scorned and
preached against the Catholic
Church; Barrow wrote a book
against it; Sandys called the Vicar
of Christ ‘that triple-crowned
thief and murderer’; Hooker sent
for a dissenter on his death-bed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
Morton, Bramhall, Andrews, and
the rest avowed the opinion that
the Protestant sects of the Continent
were as true churches as their
own. Episcopal ordination, as the
late Mr. J. Keble confessed, was
not made a condition for holding
Anglican preferment until the latter
half of the XVIIth century; and
it was <em>then</em> adopted as a weapon
against the growing power of the
dissenters. <em>Then</em> Anglicans who
had always argued as Protestants
against the church began to argue
as Catholics against dissent.”</p>

<p>At the present time, however, the
English episcopate seems veering
round again to the Protestant quarter,
against the pseudo-Catholic
innovations of a portion of the
clergy. The <cite>Church Herald</cite>, which,
up to the time when it ceased to
exist, a few weeks ago, had been
protesting for many months previously,
with good reason, against
the implacable opposition offered
by the Anglican bishops to the so-called
“Catholic revival,” gravely
told its readers, while asserting
once more that “no one trusts the
bishops,” and that “of influence
they have and can have next to
none,” nevertheless that “their
claims as Catholic bishops were
never so firmly established.” (!)
Certainly Anglican logic is peculiar.
Their bishops were never more
vehemently opposed to the Catholic
faith; but no matter, “never
were they more truly Catholic.” (!)</p>

<p>“I have very reluctantly,” says
Dr. Lee (as reported in the <cite>John
Bull</cite>), “come to a conclusion which
makes me melancholy&mdash;that the
passing of the Public Worship Bill
has to all intents and purposes sealed
the fate of the Church of England.”
Its end, he thinks, is very
near, because no church can last
unless it be a true portion of the
one family of God&mdash;not a mere human
sect, taking its variable opinion
from the civil government, and
its practice from a parliamentary
officer without the faintest shadow
of spiritual authority. “The point
that gravely perplexes me,” he
writes, “with regard to the new law,
is that our bishops, one and all,
have, with their eyes open and deliberately,
renounced their spiritual
jurisdiction, which, for both provinces
and every diocese, is placed
in the hands of Lord Penzance, ex-judge
of the Divorce Court.” For
which reason certain Ritualist
papers lament it as “strange and
sad” that Dr. Lee should say of
the bishops and their bill exactly
the same <em>after</em> their victory as they
themselves had said <em>before</em> it. These
papers, after the example of some
learned Anglican professors, etc.,
are ready enough beforehand to
threaten, in the event of such and
such a decision, to “reconsider
their position.” The decision is
made; they then discover that, after
all, it is not so very serious, and
compose themselves, for the third,
or fourth, or fifth time, just where
they were before.</p>

<p>It is stated that the first case
under the Public Worship Regulations
Act is now being brought before
Lord Penzance. It is a suit
against the Rev. J. C. Ridsdale, incumbent
of S. Peter’s, Folkestone.
According to the new law, three inhabitants
made a representation to
the Archbishop of Canterbury as
to the manner in which the services
were conducted at S. Peter’s. A
copy of the representation was forwarded
to Mr. Ridsdale, and, no
agreement to abide by the decision
of the archbishop having been
made, the proceedings will be determined
by the judge, from whom
there is an ultimate appeal to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
Majesty in council. There are, it
is said, three cases pending under
the new law; and fresh proceedings
are about to be commenced against
the clergy of S. Alban’s, Holborn.
The bill bids fair to be as one-sided
in its application as it avowedly
was in its intention. “The Puritan
triumph in the XVIIth century,”
said the Bishop of London, “would
not be more disastrous than a
pseudo-Catholic triumph now,” and
the rest of the episcopal bench are
evidently of the same mind.</p>

<p>Nor can it be matter of much
surprise that such repression should
be exercised against men, many of
them truly earnest and self-denying,
who are the means of reviving
a certain amount of Catholic doctrine
as well as practice (however
illegal) in their communion, when
Dr. Lee is able to write as follows
to an episcopal correspondent:
“The Catholic faith, Archbishop
Tait, in the presence of his suffragans,
frankly declared that <em>neither
he nor they believed</em>, and his grace&mdash;to
give him all credit&mdash;has done his
worst to get rid of it.”</p>

<p>Here again can we wonder at the
result, even to her highest dignitaries,
of the uncertain teaching of a
church which, from its very beginning,
was intended to be a compromise?</p>

<p>And, again, how can a church
which is essentially a compromise
be expected to sympathize with that
unchanging church which is “the
pillar and ground of the truth”?</p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p>To return to Father Tondini’s
essay. We come now to consider
the newest among the sects, the so-called
Old Catholics, who, after the
manner of many other schismatics,
appropriate the name of “Catholic”
with an affix of their own,
which is a proof that theirs is a
base metal, unworthy of the “image
and superscription of the King”
or his appointed vicegerent.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone’s judgment of
these people is thus expressed:
“When the cup of endurance,” he
says, “which had so long been filling,
began, with the Council of the
Vatican in 1870, to overflow, the
most famous and learned living
theologian of the Roman communion,
Dr. von Döllinger, long the
foremost champion of his church,
refused compliance, and submitted,
with his temper undisturbed and
his freedom unimpaired, to the extreme
and most painful penalty of
excommunication. With him many
of the most learned and respected
theologians of the Roman communion
in Germany underwent the
same sentence. The very few who
elsewhere (I do not speak of Switzerland)
suffered in like manner
deserve an admiration rising in proportion
to their fewness.</p>

<p>“It seems as though Germany,
from which Luther blew the mighty
trumpet that even now echoes
through the land, still retained
her primacy in the domain of
conscience, still supplied the <i lang="la">centuria
prærogativa</i> of the great <i lang="la">comitia</i>
of the world.”<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>After giving this quotation, Father
Tondini, in the exercise of his
“mental freedom,” proceeds to examine
whether Old Catholics really
deserve this highly laudatory and
enthusiastic passage, and in what
their merit consists.</p>

<p>Their merit consists “in having
rebelled against the church to which
they previously belonged, on the
ground that, in their conviction,
she had changed her faith.</p>

<p>“Not one single bishop, not one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
out of the teaching body of the
church, has expressed the same
conviction. Old Catholics are, then,
a mere handful … protesting
against the Pope and the whole
episcopate, preferring their own
private judgment to that of the
whole teaching body of the Catholic
Church, and fully decided to do
everything in their power to bring
about the triumph of their private
personal judgment. Their first act
was to raise a schism in the church.
They had openly and freely separated
themselves from her long before
the sentence of excommunication
was notified to them. They
then became the occasion of a severe
persecution against their former
fellow-Catholics; and now,
whilst the persecution is raging,
and Old Catholics, supported by
governments and the press, have
suffered neither in person nor property,
nor in their individual liberty,
we are called upon to bestow upon
those who suffered ‘in like manner’
an admiration rising in proportion
to their fewness!”<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>But why is this? and what is
the <cite>Expostulation</cite> itself but a cry
of alarm to prevent British Catholics
from rebelling against the
queen? Why, then, is the rebellion
of some private individuals to
be extolled in terms like these?
Or if, indeed, strong private religious
convictions (taking it for
granted that the Old Catholics have
such) make it praiseworthy to rebel
against the church, why should not
strong private political convictions
make it equally praiseworthy to rebel
against the state? The field
of similar applications is fearfully
wide, and many a parental admonition
to an indolent or disobedient
child might be met by the young
rebel in Mr. Gladstone’s words,
that “with temper undisturbed,
with freedom unimpaired,” he had
no intention to do as he was bid.</p>

<p>The first official document of the
Old Catholics is the “Declaration”
of Dr. von Döllinger and his adherents,
dated Munich, June, 1871,<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
and which bears the signatures of
Dr. von Döllinger, sixteen professors
or doctors, seven magistrates,
three private gentlemen, two manufacturers,
one “Maître royal des
cérémonies,” and one “Intendant
royal de musique au théâtre de
cour”&mdash;thirty-one signatures in all,
to which was added later that of the
unhappy Loyson.</p>

<p>The second document is a French
manifesto or appeal, “Aux fidèles
de l’Ancienne Eglise Catholique,”
signed “E. Michaud, Docteur en
Théologie,” dated 1872, and widely
circulated in France, with a request
that every reader will help to make
it known and gain as many additional
adherents as possible.</p>

<p>The style of both documents is
peculiar. They alike belong to
those literary productions which betray
an almost feverish excitement
of mind. A small number of persons,
till lately belonging to the
Catholic Church, declare themselves
“determined” to do their utmost
towards bringing about “the reform
of ecclesiastical affairs, so long desired
and henceforth so inevitable,
in the organization as well as in the
life of the church.” In fact, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
authors of both these documents
show a faith in their own infallibility,
both doctrinal and practical, at
least as strong as their conviction
of the fallibility of the Pope. They
are peculiarly unfortunate in their
choice of the fathers they quote,
as well as in their appeal to the authority
of S. Paul. Their style is
certainly wholly unlike that of this
great apostle, who, with so much
earnestness and humility, begs the
prayers of the faithful, while the
necessity of prayer for such an undertaking
as that which the Old
Catholics call the “regeneration of
the church” is not even once alluded
to in their manifestoes.</p>

<p>There is another consideration
which presents itself. Every practical
man is careful to ascertain the
competency, in any particular subject,
of those who give him their
advice upon it. A sick man would
not consult a lawyer for his
cure, nor an aggrieved man seek
legal advice of his baker or shoemaker.
The distinguished magistrates
who signed the German Declaration
must be supposed to have
done so, not in consequence of a
clear and detailed knowledge of the
grounds of the assertions it contained,
but in consequence of their
confidence in Dr. von Döllinger,
which led them to adopt his views.
In the same way must be explained
the adhesions given by the respectable
manufacturers, “Maître royal des
cérémonies,” and “Intendant royal
de musique au théâtre de cour”; for
though these pursuits need not be
in themselves an obstacle to a man
being well acquainted with religious
matters, still they are an undeniable
argument against his having made
it the chief object of his studies.</p>

<p>“Now,” continues Father Tondini,
“the charges brought in the present
case against the Catholic Church
are so heavy, and the mere probability
of their being founded on
truth of such vital importance to
the whole Christian world, …
that to require something more
than the ordinary amount of theological
science which is in general
to be found in men involved in
worldly affairs of the most distracting
kind, is only acting in accordance
with the most ordinary laws
of prudence. All this will become
evident if we only suppose that the
‘Declaration’ had appeared without
the signatures of Dr. von Döllinger
and the above-mentioned professors.”
In looking over the latter
we find that none of them can lay
any claim to the same scientific
authority and repute as that which
he enjoys; and the same remark
applies to all who have subsequently
joined the Old Catholics.</p>

<p>With regard to Dr. von Döllinger
himself, he has till now, if we are
rightly informed, abstained from
joining his fellow-subscribers to the
German “Declaration” in their
submission to Mgr. Reinkens, the
Old-Catholic Bishop of Germany.
“Thus the chief promoter of the
opposition to the Vatican Council
stands apart, and we should be
grateful to any one who might tell
us to what church he belongs and
whom he recognizes as his legitimate
bishop. We cannot suppose
that he whom Mr. Gladstone calls
‘the most famous and learned theologian
of the Roman communion’
has the pretension of forming a
church in his own person.”</p>

<p>Father Tondini next notices the
remarkable phenomenon presented
by Old Catholicism during the first
three years of its existence as
body without a head, and calls
the reader’s attention to the following
passage in the French manifesto:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span></p>

<p>“If it be the will of God,” thus
it runs, “that some Roman bishops
have the courage to return publicly
to the profession of the ancient
faith, we will place them with joy
at our head. And if none break
publicly with heresy, our church,
though essentially episcopal, will
not for that reason be condemned
to die; for as soon as it shall be
possible to regularize its situation
in this respect, we shall choose
priests who will receive either in
the West or in the East an episcopal
consecration of unquestionable
validity.”</p>

<p>“These,” he remarks, “are plain
words. It evidently results from
them that there was a time when
the church, ‘unstained by any Roman
innovation,’ was still looking
for a bishop&mdash;in other words, for a
head, which she did not possess as
yet. How, in spite of this deficiency,
the Old-Catholic Church
could be termed essentially episcopal
we are at a loss to understand.
That which is essential to a thing
is that without which it cannot possibly
exist for a single moment;
but here we are asked to believe in
a miracle which at once destroys
all our physical and metaphysical
notions of things. A new-born
warrior fighting without a head,
and a being existing without one
of its essential constituents&mdash;such
are the wonders which accompanied
the genesis of the so-called regenerated
church of the Old Catholics.”</p>

<p>The German Declaration in like
manner states the then headless
condition of the Old-Catholic body.
Its subscribers, and among them
Prof. Reinkens, say they look forward
to a time when “all Catholicity
shall be placed under the
direction of a primate and an
episcopacy, which by means of
science,” etc., etc., “and not by the
decrees of the Vatican, … shall
approach the crowning object assigned
to Christian development&mdash;we
mean that of the union of the
other Christian confessions now
separated from us,” etc.</p>

<p>Such was their language in June,
1871, when they were already nearly
a year old. Their first bishop,
Joseph Hubert Reinkens, was consecrated
in August, 1873. These
dates are very important. No power
on earth will ever be able to
annul them as historical facts, which
prove that a body calling itself the
true church of Christ has existed
some time without a single bishop,
although bishops are essential to
the church of Christ, as Scripture,
tradition, history, all antiquity
agree. S. Cyprian says:</p>

<p>“The church is the people in
union with the bishop&mdash;a flock adhering
to its shepherd. The bishop
is in the church and the
church in the bishop. He who is
not with the bishop is not in the
church.”<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> And again: “He cannot
be accounted a bishop who, in
despite of the evangelic and apostolic
tradition, has, of himself, become
one (<i lang="la">a se ipso ortus est, nemini
succedens</i>), and succeeds to none.”</p>

<p>Now, “to what bishop” (asks Father
Tondini) “did Dr. Reinkens
succeed? His first pastoral letter,
dated August 11, 1873, is addressed
‘to the priests and faithful of
Germany who persevere in the ancient
Catholic faith.’ Who ever
heard of the bishop and diocese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
of Germany before this letter?”
Again: “That same Dr. Reinkens
who in June, 1871, signed the
‘Declaration’ in which the Christian
confessions outside the Roman
Church were called ‘Christian confessions
now separated from us,’ in
August, 1873, saluted with the title
of ‘Old Catholics,’ the Jansenists
of Holland, and Mgr. Heykamp,
the bishop by whom he was consecrated,
with that of ‘bishop of the
Old Catholics’!”<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<h4>III.</h4>

<p>We now come to the consideration
of Old Catholicism as an instrument
of union between the
Christian Episcopal churches. In
accordance with their “Declaration,”
the Old Catholics insist upon
its being one of their main objects
to reunite the Christian churches
separated from Rome during the
VIIIth and IXth centuries, and
complacently boast of the marks of
sympathy bestowed upon them by
these churches.</p>

<p>From one of their manifestoes
Father Tondini quotes the following
important statements:</p>

<p>“The bishops of the Oriental
Orthodox Church”&mdash;thus runs the
manifesto&mdash;“and those of the Episcopal
Church of England and the
United States of America (!) encourage
Old Catholicism with their
most profound sympathy. Representatives
of the Orthodox Church
of Russia assist every year at its
congress.… The interest displayed
for it by governments is not
inferior to that of the churches.…
The governments of Russia and of
England are disposed to recognize
its rights when it shall be opportune
to do so.”<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>Upon which he points out the
exceeding inexpediency, for their
own sakes, of these governments or
their bishops having any participation
in the doings of Old Catholics;
and this for the following reasons,
which are worthy of careful consideration
by the two governments in
question, and which we give in his
own words:</p>

<p>“In order, it would seem, to escape
the stringent conclusion of S.
Cyprian’s words, ‘He who does
not succeed to other bishops, but is
self-originated, cannot be reckoned
among bishops,’ Mgr. Reinkens, in
his above-quoted pastoral letter, …
authoritatively declared not only
that the ‘apostolic see of Rome
was vacant,’ but that not one of the
actually existing Roman Catholic
bishops was legitimate.</p>

<p>“In support of this assumption
the Old-Catholic bishop invokes
some fathers of the church&mdash;not, indeed,
what they said or did while
living, but what they would say or
do if they were to return to life:
‘If the great bishops of the ancient
church were to return to life in the
midst of us,’ says Mgr. Reinkens,
‘a Cyprian, (!) a Hilary, an Ambrose,
… they would acknowledge
none of the existing bishops
of the Roman Catholic Church as
validly elected.’<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>“So much for the fact. As it
can only be ascertained when those
great bishops are restored to life, all
we can do is to defer this verification
until the great day of judgment.</p>

<p>“Now comes the general principle
on which the assumed fact is
founded. Let us listen again to
Mgr. Reinkens: ‘They [the resuscitated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
bishops of the ancient
church] would not acknowledge
any of the existing bishops of the
Roman Catholic Church as validly
elected, because none of them
were appointed in conformity with
the immutable rule of the fathers
of the church. Never! no, never!
would they have received into their
company, in the quality of a Catholic
bishop, one who had not been
chosen by the people and the clergy.
This mode of election was considered
by them as of divine precept, and
consequently as immutable.’”</p>

<p>“How many bishops are there in
existence at the present day,” asks
Father Tondini, “either in the Anglican
Church or in the Christian
East, who have been chosen by
the people and the clergy?”</p>

<p>In answer to this question we
have, respecting the non-popular
mode of election in the Oriental
Orthodox Church, the following
trustworthy information: In the
Orthodox Church of the Turkish
Empire the election of a patriarch
is made by the members of its
synod, which is composed of metropolitans,
of one of their own number,
and this election “is then made
known to the people assembled in
the atrium of the synodicon, who
give, by acclamation and the cry
of ἄξιος (worthy), their assent to
the election.… This, however, is
in fact an empty formality; the
more so as the election itself is the
result of previous secret understandings
between the more influential
members of the synod and the leading
men among the people.”<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>“The three patriarchs of Alexandria,
Antioch, and Jerusalem are
elected by their respective synods,
composed of metropolitans.</p>

<p>“The metropolitans and bishops
of each patriarchate are elected by
the respective patriarchs, together
with their synods.”</p>

<p>Did the Patriarch of Constantinople,
in agreeing, on the invitation
of Dr. von Döllinger, to send representatives
of the Greek Orthodox
Church to the Old Catholic Church
Congress at Bonn, forget that, according
to Mgr. Reinkens, all bishops
who have not been elected by
the clergy and the people are illegitimate
bishops, that their sees
are all vacant, that this mode of
election is of divine precept, and
consequently immutable?</p>

<p>“We know not,” says Father
Tondini, “which of the two is more
to be wondered at: the boldness
of the Old Catholics in inviting the
patriarch to be represented at the
congress, or the logical inconsistency
of the patriarch in accepting the
invitation.”</p>

<p>Next, with regard to the Orthodox
Church of the Russian Empire.</p>

<p>No one who may have read
“The Future of the Russian
Church,” which recently appeared
in the pages of <span class="smcap">The Catholic
World</span>,<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> will need to be told how
little voice either the inferior clergy
or people of Russia have in the
election of their bishops. The
Most Holy Governing Synod proposes
to his majesty two persons
(on an eparchy becoming vacant),
and that one of the two selected by
the czar is chosen and consecrated.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
(See Consett, <cite>Spiritual Regulation
of Peter the Great</cite>.)</p>

<p>In the formula of the oath taken
by the Russian bishops before being
consecrated, they engage themselves
to yield true obedience to the Holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
Synod, “the legitimate authority
instituted by the pious Emperor Peter
the Great of immortal memory,
and confirmed by command of his (or
her) present imperial majesty,” and
to obey all the rules and statutes
made by the authority of the synod
agreeably to the will of his (or her)
imperial majesty, adding the following
words: “Furthermore, I do testify
that I have not received this
province in consideration of gold
or silver given by me, … but I
have received it by the free will of
our most serene and most puissant
sovereign (by name), and by the
<em>election</em> of the Holy Legislative
Synod.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> Moreover, at the beginning
of the ceremony the bishop-consecrator
thus addresses the newly-elected
bishop: “Reverend Father
N., the Most Serene and Most
Puissant Czar N. N. <em>hath commanded,
by his own singular and proper
edict</em>, and the Holy Legislative Synod
of all the Russias gives its benediction
thereto, that you, holy sir,
be bishop of the city of N.”; to
which the future bishop is made to
answer: “Since the Most Serene,
etc., Czar has <em>commanded</em>, and the
… synod … has judged me
worthy to undertake this province,
I give thanks therefor, and do undertake
it and in nowise gainsay.”<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>After similarly disposing (with
regard to the remaining Oriental
churches) of Mr. Gladstone’s extraordinary
assertion that “the ancient
principles of popular election
and control exist in the Christian
East”&mdash;an assertion of which also
he makes use as a weapon against
the Catholic Church<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>&mdash;Father
Tondini passes on to the election
of bishops in the Anglican Church.
With regard to this, the following
abstract from Stephen is amply sufficient
to show how far “the principles
of popular election” prevail in
the nomination of the bishops of
the Establishment:</p>

<p>“By statute 25 Henry VIII. c. 20
the law was altered and the right
of nomination secured to the crown,
it being enacted that, at every future
avoidance of a bishopric, the
king may send the dean and chapter
his usual license to proceed to
election, or <i lang="fr">congé d’elire</i>, which is
always to be accompanied with a
letter missive from the king, containing
the name of the person
whom he would have them elect;
and if the dean and chapter delay
their election above twelve days,
the nomination shall devolve to
the king, who may by letters-patent
appoint such person as he pleases.
This election or nomination, if it
be of a bishop, must be signified by
the king’s letters-patent to the archbishop
of the province; if it be of
an archbishop, to the other archbishop
and two bishops, or to four
bishops, requiring them to confirm,
invest, and consecrate the person
so elected; which they are bound
to perform immediately, without
any application to the See of
Rome. After which the bishop-elect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
shall sue to the king for his
temporalities, shall take oath to
the king and to none other, and
shall take restitution of his secular
possessions out of the king’s hand
only. And if such dean and chapter
do not elect in this manner by
this act appointed, or if such archbishop
or bishop do refuse to confirm,
invest, and consecrate such
bishop-elect, they shall incur all
the penalties of a præmunire&mdash;that
is, the loss of all civil rights, the
forfeiture of lands, goods, and
chattels, and imprisonment during
the royal pleasure. It is to be observed,
however, that the mode
here described of appointing bishops
applies only to such sees as are
of old foundation. The five new
bishoprics created by Henry VIII.
… have always been donatives,
and conferred by letters-patent
from the crown; and the case is
the same as to the bishopric of Ripon,
now recently created” (Stephen’s
<cite>Commentaries on the Laws of
England</cite>, vol. iii. p. 61).</p>

<p>In concluding his essay, Father
Tondini repeats Mgr. Reinkens’
words: “If the great bishops of the
ancient church were to return to life
in the midst of us, … never! no,
never! would they have received
into their company, in the quality
of a Christian bishop, one who had
not been chosen by the people and
the clergy; this mode of election
was considered by them as of divine
precept, and consequently as
immutable”; and then asks: “How
can the support given by the state
churches and governments of England
and Russia to Old Catholicism
be explained? Is it for the purpose
of declaring that all the episcopal
sees, both of England and Russia, are
vacant and awaiting the choice of
the people?”</p>

<p>The reader, being now acquainted
with much of the contents as
well as with the general tenor of
Father Tondini’s essay, may find
some interest (possibly amusement
also) in comparing the following
remarks of the London <cite>Tablet</cite>
(Sept. 18) with the confirmation of
their accurate appreciation of the
“British Philistine’s” pride in his
own obtuseness so ingenuously furnished
(Sept. 25) by a writer in the
<cite>Church Review</cite>:</p>

<p class="center">LONDON TABLET.</p>

<p>“We are a little afraid
that the Anglican sympathizers
with the Old
Catholics will not be
sharp enough to understand
the keen logic of
Father Tondini’s concise
reasoning. The British
Philistine rather glories
in being impervious to
logic or wit, and chuckles
over his own obtuseness
as a proof of the
strength of the religion
which he patronizes. It
is provoking to a zealous
controversialist to have
to do battle with such a
heavy antagonist, but we
trust the good father
will not cease to labor at
the conversion of our illogical
but worthy fellow-countrymen.
We thank
him for a well-timed and
well-written pamphlet.”</p>

<p>(The <cite>Universe</cite> calls it
“another fatal blow for
the theology of our ex-prime
minister; closely
reasoned and perfectly
terrible in its manner of
grasping its luckless opponent.”&mdash;<cite>Universe</cite>,
September
25, 1875.)</p>

<p class="center">CHURCH REVIEW.</p>

<p>“The Rev. Cæsar
Tondini, who is fond of
linking Russian Orthodoxy
and Anglican Catholicism
in one sweeping
condemnation, is by no
means one of the Pope’s
greatest controversialists.
But this pamphlet is
hardly worthy of even
his reputation. Every
point in it might be answered
by a <i lang="la">tu quoque</i>.
Fact might be set against
fact, defect against defect,
innovation against
innovation, inconsistency
against inconsistency,
and error against error.
But picking holes in our
neighbor’s coat will never
mend the rents in our
own. So we forbear, content
for the present to
congratulate ourselves
on the fact that, while
Romanists are still utterly
blind to their own nakedness,
we have at least
plucked a fig-leaf by the
efforts already made to
bring about reunion.”
[Who could help thinking,
“We would not give
a fig for such a leaf as
this”?]</p>

<h4>IV.</h4>

<p>We will conclude the present
notice by some account of the
recent Conference at Bonn, in
which the Old Catholics have given
abundant proof that they are no
freer from variation than are any
other of the Protestant sects.</p>

<p>Desirous of strengthening their
position by alliance with other
forms of schism, Dr. von Döllinger
invited to a congress representatives
of the schismatic Greek and Russian
Church, the English and American
Episcopalians, and the Old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
Catholics. The assembly was called
the “International Conference
of the Union of the Christian
Churches,” and proposed as its object
an agreement on the fundamental
points of doctrine professed
by Christendom before its divisions,
with a view “to restore by a reform
as broad as possible the ancient
Catholic Church of the West.”<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>In this International Conference,
which began on the 12th of August
and ended on the 16th, the
principal Orientals, who numbered
about twenty in all, were
two bishops from Roumania; an
archimandrite from Belgrade; two
archimandrites, Anastasiades and
Bryennios, from Constantinople,
sent by the patriarch as being well
versed in all the questions which
have divided and which still divide
the Greek and Latin Churches;
there were also present the Archbishop
of Syra and Tino, Mgr. Licourgos,
well known in England, and
six professors, among whom were
Profs. Osinnin and Janischef, the
latter being the gentleman who at
the last Conference was so severe
on Anglican orders. The Protestant
Episcopalians were the most
numerous, being about a hundred
in number; but they had only one
bishop among them&mdash;namely, the
Bishop of Gibraltar. Those of
Winchester and Lincoln, who had
also given their adherence to the
movement, found themselves at the
last moment unable to attend. The
most notable person in the Anglican
group was Dr. Liddon, Canon of
S. Paul’s. Dean Howson, of Chester,
was also one of its members;
his “views” on nearly every point
of church teaching being diametrically
opposed to those of Canon
Liddon. The same group contained
an Unitarian minister from
Chesterfield (Mr. Smith), and a
“Primitive Methodist” (Mr. Booth,
a chemist and druggist of the same
town), who on a late occasion was
voted for and returned at the head
of the poll as an advocate of secular
education. The Americans
sent only three delegates, and the
“Reformed Church” one&mdash;the Rev.
Th. de Félice. The Old Catholics,
all of whom were Germans, numbered
eighteen or twenty, with Dr.
von Döllinger and Bishop Reinkens
at their head, supported by Herr
Langen, “Altkatholik”; Herr Lange,
Protestant, and Herr Lang, the
least orthodox of all. Close to this
little group figured seven or eight
more German Protestants. In all,
the Conference was composed of
about one hundred and fifty persons,
of whom the <cite>Times</cite> observes
that, “slender as the gathering was,
it was forced to display an almost
ludicrous caution in drawing up
such articles of faith as would command
the assent of the whole assembly”&mdash;articles
“so vague that
they might be made to mean anything
or nothing”; and, further,
that the few English divines who
went to Bonn to play at a council
no more represent the Church of
England than Dr. von Döllinger
represents the Church of Rome, but
spoke in the name of nothing but
themselves. It suggests to them,
with scornful irony, that “charity
begins at home,” and that in the
present distracted state of the
Church of England, “when nothing
keeps the various and conflicting
‘schools’ of clergy in the same communion
but the secular forces of the
Establishment, there is surely there
a magnificent field for the exercise
of even a genius of conciliation.”</p>

<p>A Bavarian Protestant clergyman
informed the assembly that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
as there was no chance of their
coming to an agreement by means
of discussion about dogma, they had
far better throw over dogma altogether,
and trust to brotherly love
to bring about union. Dr. von
Döllinger, however, said that if they
all shared this opinion, they had
better have stayed at home. One
reverend gentleman proposed to
settle the difference by examining
where the fathers all harmonize,
and abiding by the result (a task
which, as a looker-on observed,
would give all the theological acuteness
and learning in the world
abundant work for about half a dozen
centuries); whereupon Bishop
Reinkens nervously tried to draw
the debaters into the cloud-land of
love and unity of purpose, etc., etc.
But here Canon Liddon hastened to
the rescue with a carefully-prepared
scheme for effecting the reconciliation
of the East and West, which was
apparently received by the Orientals
with a tranquil indifference,
and was chiefly remarkable for its
adroit semblance of effecting much,
while it in fact does nothing. Yielding
here and there a phrase of no
special meaning, it declared in the
next clause that it would retain its
own form of the Creed until the
dispute should be settled by “a
truly œcumenical council.” This
announcement was the signal for an
outburst of disapproval, questions,
and objections. “What did Canon
Liddon mean by an œcumenical
council?” “An assent of the
whole episcopate.” This was too
much for Lord Plunkett, who exclaimed
that he would never have
come to the Conference if he had
known that it meant to confine the
Christian Church within the bounds
of episcopacy. What, he should
like to know, was to hinder Presbyterian
ministers from being admitted
equally with bishops to take part
in an œcumenical council?</p>

<p>On this the canon obligingly
agreed to substitute “the whole
church” for the obnoxious term;
but while the assembly hesitated,
some paragon of caution suggested
the phrase “sufficient authority.”
However, this masterpiece of conciliation&mdash;for
nobody could say what it
meant&mdash;was rejected for “the whole
church,” this latter being equally
ambiguous to those who were adopting
it. On this they agreed. As
the <cite>Times’</cite> correspondent observes,
“Everybody will agree with everybody
else when all deliberately use
words for the purpose of concealing
what they mean. When men
differ from each other essentially, it
is childish folly to try to unite them
by an unmeaning phrase.”</p>

<p>The great question was that of
the procession of the Holy Spirit.
On this M. Osinnin was the chief
speaker on behalf of the Greeks,
and he seems to have challenged
every interpretation of the Westerns,
maintaining even that <i lang="la">procedit</i>
was not an exact rendering of
ἐκπορεύεται. However, a committee
was appointed, composed of
the Germans, two Orientals, an
Englishman, and an American;
and Dr. von Döllinger announced
to the Conference on its last sitting
that an agreement had been arrived
at on all essential points. The
Greeks were to retain their version
of the Nicene Creed, and the Westerns
theirs; the latter were to admit
that the <i lang="la">Filioque</i> had been improperly
introduced, and that both
were to agree that, whichever version
they used, their meaning was
that the Holy Spirit proceeds from
the Father through the Son. With
regard to the last point, however,
the Orientals said that although
they had personally no objection to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
the expression, yet they must decline
to give any official assent to
the article until it had been submitted
to their synods or other
competent authorities at home.</p>

<p>Judging from every account we
have seen (all of them Protestant)
of the Bonn Conference, it is evident
that its members, in order to
give an appearance of mutual agreement,
subscribed to propositions
which may be taken in various
senses. The six articles agreed to
by the committee were couched in
the following terms:</p>

<p>“We believe with S. John Damascene,
1, that the Holy Spirit
proceeds from the Father as the beginning,
the cause, and the fountain
of Deity. 2. That the Holy Spirit
does not proceed from the Son
ἐκ τοῦ υίοῦ, and that for this
reason there is in the Godhead
only one beginning, one cause,
through which all that is in the
Godhead is produced. 3. That
the Holy Spirit is the image of the
Son, who is the image of the Father,
proceeding from the Father and
resting in the Son, as the outbeaming
power of the latter. 4. The
Holy Spirit is the personal bringing
forth of the Father, but belonging
to the Son, yet not of the Son, since
he is the Spirit of the Godhead
which speaks forth the Word. 5.
The Holy Spirit forms the connecting
link between the Father and
the Son, and is united to the Father
through the Son. 6. The
Holy Spirit proceeds [or, as amended
by Mr. Meyrick, ‘issues’] from
the Father through the Son.”</p>

<p>It is the supposed denial of that
unity of the αρχή, or originating
principle in the Most Holy Trinity,
which has always been the ground
of the Greek objections to the
Latin form of the Creed.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> “The
double <em>Procession</em><a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> of the Holy
Ghost has always been believed in
the church, only to a certain number
of minds it remained for a time
obscure, and thus there are to be
found in the writings of the fathers
passages in which mention is made
rather of the procession from the
Father than of the double procession
from the Father and the Son,
but yet none which, although not
formally indicating, exclude or contradict
it.</p>

<p>“In recurring to the expressions
employed by the fathers, the members
of the Bonn Conference have
made choice of some of those which
are vague and least explicit, instead
of others which convey to the mind
a clear idea. We are fully aware
that, from a historical point of view,
the question of the <i lang="la">Filioque</i> presents
some difficulties. At Nicæa,
in 325, the question of <em>procession</em>
was not even mentioned, from the
fact of its not having up to that
time been raised. At Constantinople,
in 381, in order to cut short
discussions which were tending to
result in a denial of the Trinity, the
addition had been made to the
Creed that the Holy Ghost proceeds
from the Father, without
mention of the Son. At the Third
Council of Toledo, in 589, the faith
of the church in the double procession
was clearly indicated by the
addition of the <i lang="la">Filioque</i>&mdash;an addition,
which was adopted by several particular
councils, and which became
general in France. The popes,
however, foreseeing that the Orientals&mdash;always
inclined to be ill-disposed
towards the West&mdash;would
make this addition an excuse for
breaking off into schism, appeared
at first but little in favor of a modification
which, although expressing
with greater accuracy the faith of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
the church, would furnish fresh
fuel to theological disputes. It
was a question of prudence. But
when the truth was once placed in
peril, they hesitated no longer. All
the West chanted the <i lang="la">Filioque</i>;
and the Greeks themselves, on repeated
occasions, and notably at
the Council of Florence in 1438,
confessed the double procession to
be an article of the Catholic faith.”</p>

<p>The Old Catholics of Bonn have
thus made, as it seems to us, a retrogression
on this question. Will
this help to secure “the union of
the Christian churches” which was
the object of the Conference? In
outward appearance possibly it
may, because all the separated communities
willingly join hand in
hand against the true church of
Christ; but in reality, no, for the
Greeks will continue to reject the
procession through the Son, as the
Anglicans will continue to accept
it; and we have no need to say
that the Catholic Church will never
cease to confess the double procession,
and to sing: <i lang="la">Qui ex Patre
Filioque procedit</i>.</p>

<p>With regard to other subjects
discussed by the meeting at Bonn,
we will briefly mention that Canon
Liddon spoke against the invocation
of saints, and Dr. von Döllinger
talked of “making a clear sweep”
of the doctrine of purgatory and indulgences;
although, in stating the
belief of his co-religionists, he was
obliged to reaffirm the doctrine of
purgatory in terms nearly equivalent
to those of the Creed of Pope
Pius IV. On this matter, whatever
the Greeks might do, how many of
the Anglicans would agree with the
Old Catholics? Not only are the
people who go to these conferences
from England in no sense representatives
of the body to which
they belong, but even they themselves
do not always abide by what
they have agreed to.<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Dean Howson,
in a statement he read at the
last Conference, put a Low-Church
interpretation on the resolution of
last year’s Conference about the
Eucharist, which interpretation Canon
Liddon immediately repudiated.
Before Greek or German
schismatics can unite with the
Church of England, they will have
to make up their minds as to which
of at least four theological systems
<em>is</em> Anglicanism, and then to get <em>that</em>
admitted by the other three.</p>

<p>As to the validity of Anglican
orders, Dr. von Döllinger appears
to have considered it as resting on
the certainty of Parker’s consecration,
without going into the really
more important questions of Barlow’s
orders, or the sufficiency of form or
intention, all of which are matters of
such grave doubt as to be practically
worthless to any one insisting upon
the necessity of <em>certainty</em> that the
communion to which he belongs
possesses the apostolic succession.</p>

<p>We cannot conclude this sketch
of the Bonn Conference without
presenting our readers with a portrait
of its chief, Dr. von Döllinger,
drawn by a friendly hand&mdash;that of
a French apostate priest, and one
of the members of the Conference&mdash;which
we reproduce from the
pages of the <cite>Indépendance Belge</cite>.</p>

<p>“M. Döllinger,” he writes, “pronounced
three long and eloquent
discourses, marked by that seriousness
and depth which so especially
characterize his manner of speaking;
but notwithstanding their
merit, they have not resulted in
any new conclusion. May not the
blame be in some measure due to
M. Overbeck, who … introduced
into the discussion authorities posterior
to the epoch of the separation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
of East and West, and mingled the
question of the seven œcumenical
councils with that of the <i lang="la">Filioque</i>?…
At all events, both obscurity
and coldness found their way into
the debates.…</p>

<p>“Truly, this excellent M. Döllinger
seems fated to go on from one
contradiction to another, and to accept
one year that which he refused
in the preceding. For instance, in
1871, at the congress at Munich, he
energetically opposed the organization
of Old-Catholic parishes; afterwards
he resigned himself to consent
to this. In 1871 he desired
the Old Catholics to confine themselves,
after his example, to protesting
against the excommunication
they had incurred; but later on he
is willing that their priests should
take upon themselves the full exercise
of their ministry. In 1871 and
1872 he wished to maintain the decisions
of the Council of Trent; in
1873 he decided to abandon them,
as well as the alleged œcumenicity
of this council. In 1872 … he
considered the attempts made to
establish union between the Old
Catholics and the Oriental churches
as at any rate imprudent, if not
even compromising. In 1874 he
adopted the idea of which he had
been so much afraid, and has since
that time used every endeavor to
promote the union of the churches.
Last year a proposal [for a committee
to examine on what points
the earliest fathers harmonized]
was rejected by M. Döllinger with
a certain disdain, as impracticable
and even childish. <em>Now</em>, however,
we find him obliged to come back
to it, at least in part.”<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> “It is by
no means in reproach but in praise
that we say this,” continues the
writer, adding: “He accepted with
the best grace possible, in one of
the sittings of the Conference this
year, the observations of Prof.
Osinnin on the manner of studying
texts; and when an erudite and venerable
man like M. Döllinger knows
how to correct himself with such
humility, he does but raise himself
in the esteem of sincere men.”</p>

<p>We would here venture to observe
that when “so erudite” a man
as Dr. von Döllinger, and one who
is acknowledged by an entire sect as
its most distinguished doctor and
its leader, is so little sure of his
doctrine that he is continually altering
it, he and his followers are surely
among the last people who ought
to refuse to the Pope the infallibility
which he in fact arrogates to
himself in setting himself above an
œcumenical council, as was that of
the Vatican.</p>

<p>If the head is represented by one
of the members as being in a chronic
state of uncertainty, so are the
members themselves represented by
another. In the <cite>Church Review</cite>
(Anglican) for Sept. 18, 1875, is an
article entitled “Old-Catholic Prospects,”
the greater part of which
consists of one of the most abusive
and malignant attacks against the
Catholic Church, and in an especial
manner against the Jesuits, that it
has ever been our lot to come upon,
even in the journal in which it appears.
After informing his readers
that “Jesuitism has led the Pope
into the egregious heresy of proclaiming
his own infallibility,” and
that “the Spirit of Christ, who would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
not rest in the Vatican Council,
where all was confusion, restraint,
and secrecy, (!) has brooded over
the humble (?) Conference of trusting
hearts” at Bonn, etc., etc., this
person, with a sudden sobriety, ventures
on a closer inspection of the
favored sect for which he had just
profanely claimed the guidance of
the Eternal Spirit, while denying it
to the œcumenical council where
the whole episcopate of the Catholic
Church was assembled with its
head, the Vicar of Christ.</p>

<p>This writer perceives that, “on
the other hand, there are dangers
in the future. At present,” he says,
“the Old-Catholic body is kept in
order by two master minds&mdash;Dr.
Döllinger and Prof. Schulte. There
are innumerable elements of discord”
(he adds) “manifest enough,
but they are as yet subdued by
reverence for Dr. Döllinger, and
beat down by the sledge-hammer
will of the lay professor. If either
of these pilots were removed, it is
impossible to say into how many
fragments Old Catholicism might
split. Its bishop has no means of
control over minds, as have Schulte
and Döllinger. Michaelis is simply
abusive and violent, ready to tear
down with hands and teeth, but incompetent
to build. Repulsive in
personal appearance, his work is
that of detraction, denunciation,
and destruction. To human eyes
the movement is no movement at
all; <em>it contains in itself no authority</em>
to hold its members personally in
check; and yet, in spite of every
disadvantage, the Old-Catholic society
is the expression of true feeling,”
etc., etc.</p>

<p>But we have dwelt long enough
on this picture; let us in conclusion
turn to a very different one.
“Rome accepts no compromise;
she dictates laws,” says M. Henri
Vignaud,<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> contrasting her in no
friendly spirit with the sect we have
been contemplating, but yet in a
spirit of calmness and candor.</p>

<p>And this, which he intends as a
reproach, is in reality a commendation.
It is the true church <em>only</em>
which <em>can</em> accept no compromise
when the truth is in question, of
which she is the faithful depository;
and whatever laws she dictates are
to guard the truth, dogmatic or
moral, issued in God’s name and
with his authority.</p>

<p>M. Vignaud acknowledges this
in the following remarkable manner:
“That cannot be conciliated
which is by nature irreconcilable.
There can be no compromise with
faith.… Either man forges to
himself the truths which must illuminate
his path, or he receives
them from the Deity, in which case
he must submit to accept the dogma
of infallibility; for without this
the whole theory falls. It is for
this reason that the apostolic Roman
Catholicity is so strong. Subordinating
reason to faith, it does
not carry within it the germ of any
scepticism. There can be no transacting
with it, and whoever goes
out of it enters, whether he is aware
of the fact or not, into rationalism,
of which the logical outcome is the
elimination of the divine action in
human affairs.”<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>It would be scarcely possible to
show more clearly that there are but
two logical positions in the world
of intelligences&mdash;namely, Catholicity
and scepticism, or, as it is called in
the present day, positivism. The
next step after refusing God all action
in human affairs is to refuse
him existence.</p>

<p>The Conference at Bonn, however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
little it may have done in other
respects, has already produced one
result which was far from the intention
of its promoters. It has furnished
an additional proof that there
is one church only which is capable
of resisting the invasion of scepticism
and unbelief, and that this
church is the Catholic and Roman.</p>

<p>“<em>Either Jesus Christ never organized
a church, or the Catholic is the
church which he organized.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<h3>MIDNIGHT MASS IN A CONVENT.</h3>

<p>I have lately been reading some
remarks on the curious association
existing between certain tastes and
odors and an involuntary exertion
of the memory by which the recurrence
of those tastes or odors recalls,
with a vividness not otherwise to be
obtained, a whole series of incidents
of past life&mdash;incidents which, with
their surrounding scenes, would
otherwise be quite forgotten and
buried out of sight by the successive
overlaying of other events of greater
interest or importance. Montaigne
has some singular illustrations of
this peculiar fact of consciousness,
and there is a brief reference to the
subject made in some recently republished
recollections of William
Hazlitt. Connected with this is
the powerful influence known to
be exercised in many well-authenticated
cases upon the nervous
sensibilities by the exhalation
of particular perfumes or the scent
of certain kinds of flowers harmless
or agreeable to all other persons.
There is a reciprocal motion of the
mind which has also been noted, by
which a particular train of thought
recalls a certain taste or smell almost
as if one received the impression
from the existing action of the
senses. An illustration is given in
the discussion just noted, where a
special association of ideas is stated
to have brought back to the writer,
with great vividness, the “smell of a
baker’s shop in Bassorah.” Individual
experiences could doubtless be
accumulated to show that this mysterious
short-hand mind-writing, so
to term it, by means of which the
memory records on its tablets, by the
aid of a single sign imprinted upon
a particular sense, the history of a
long series of associated recollections,
is not confined to the senses
of taste and smell alone, but makes
use of all.</p>

<p>The recollection of one of the
happiest days of my life&mdash;a day of
strong excitement and vivid pleasure,
but not carried to the pitch of satiety&mdash;is
inseparably associated with
the warm, aromatic smell of a cigar
which I lighted and puffed, walking
alone down a country road. In this
case the train of thought is followed
by the impression on the sense. But
in another instance within my experience
the reciprocal action of
thought and sense is reversed; the
sight of a particular object in this
latter case invariably bringing back
to my mind, with amazing distinctness,
a scene of altogether dissimilar
import, lying far back in the
memory. The circumstances are
these:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span></p>

<p>’Tis now some years since I visited
the seaport town of Shippington.
It is, or was, one of those
sleepy provincial cities which still
retain an ante-Revolutionary odor
about its dock-yard and ordnance
wharves. A group of ragged urchins
or a ruby-nosed man in greasy
and much-frayed velveteen jacket
might be seen any sunny morning
diligently fishing for hours off the
end of one of its deserted piers for
a stray bite from a perch or a flounder.
The arrival of the spring clipper-ship
from Glasgow, bringing a
renewal of stock for the iron merchants,
or of a brig with fruit
from the Mediterranean, used to set
the whole wharf population astir.
Great changes have taken place of
late years. Railroads have been
built. Instead of a single line of
ocean steamships, whose fortnightly
arrival was the event of the day, half
a dozen foreign and domestic lines
keep the port busy. Fashion, which
was once very exclusive and confined
to a few old families, has now
asserted its sway over wider ranks,
and the officers of her majesty’s
gallant Onety-Oneth, and the
heavy swells of Shippington society
whose figures adorn the broad steps
of the Shippington Club-House,
have now the pleasure of criticising
any fine morning a (thin) galaxy of
female beauty and fashion sweeping
by them, whose <i lang="fr">modes</i> rival those of
Beacon Street or Murray Hill.</p>

<p>But at the time of which I write&mdash;when
I was a school-boy, a quarter
of a century ago&mdash;it had not been
much stirred by the march of these
modern improvements. Her Britannic
majesty was then young to
the throne, and a great fervor of
loyalty prevailed; and when the
Royal Welsh Fusileers used to
march down to the parade-ground
for morning drill, with the martial
drum-major and its great bearded
Billy-Goat, presented by the queen,
dividing the honors of the head of
the regiment, it would be hard to
exaggerate the enthusiasm that
swelled the bosoms of the small
boys and African damsels who stepped
proudly along with the band.
Those were grand days, <i lang="la">quorum
pars magna fui</i>, when I too marched
down the hill from the citadel, with
a mind divided between awe and
admiration of the drum-major&mdash;curling
his mustache fiercely and
twirling his staff with an air of
majesty&mdash;and a latent terror of the
bearded pet of the regiment, whom
report declared to have destroyed
three or four boys in Malta. But
rare indeed were those holidays,
for I was impounded most of the
time in a college, where the study
of the Latin <i lang="la">Delectus</i> gave little opportunity
for the pursuit of those
more attractive branches of a liberal
education. About half a dozen of
the boys, of whom I was one, were
proficients at serving Mass. It was
therefore with great joy at the distinction
that we found ourselves
named, one frosty Christmas Eve,
to accompany Father W&mdash;&mdash; to the
Convent of the Sacred Heart, about
a mile distant, where he was to celebrate
midnight Mass. Oh! how the
snow crisped and rattled under
our feet as we marched along, full
of importance, after Father W&mdash;&mdash;,
each boy with his green bag, containing
his surplice and <i lang="fr">soutane</i>,
swung over his arm! What a jolly
night it was; and how the stars
twinkled! We slapped our hands
together, protected by our thick blue
mitts, and stamped our feet like
soldiers on the march to Moscow.
It was after ten o’clock, and the
streets were dark and nearly deserted.
To us, long used to be sound
asleep at that hour in our warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
dormitory, each boy in his own little
four-poster, with the moonlight
streaming in through the windows
on its white counterpane&mdash;and not
daring, if we were awake, so much as
to whisper to the boy next to us,
under pain of condign punishment
in the morning&mdash;there was something
mysterious and almost ghostly
in this midnight adventure. As
we passed the guard-house near
the general’s residence, the officer
of the night, muffled in his cloak,
came along on the “grand rounds.”
The sentry, in his tall bear-skin hat,
stops suddenly short in his walk.</p>

<p>“Who goes there?” he calls out in
a loud, fierce voice, bringing down
his bayonet to the charge.</p>

<p>We clung closer to Father
W&mdash;&mdash;’s skirts. “Rounds,” replies
the officer in a voice of command,
his sword rattling on the ground,
iron-hard with the frost. “What
rounds?” “Grand rounds!” “Advance,
grand rounds, and give the
countersign!” Then the sergeant
of the guard, the alarm being given,
rushes out into the street with his
men, all with bayonets drawn and
looking terrible in the moonlight.
They form in line, and the officer
advances. A whispered conversation
takes place; the soldiers present
arms and march back into the
warm guard-house; and the officer
passes silently on to the next
guard.</p>

<p>While this scene was going on we
stood half terrified and fascinated,
hardly knowing whether to take to
our heels or not. But the calm
voice of Father W&mdash;&mdash;, as he answered
“A friend” to the sentry’s
challenge, reassured us. Soon we
reached the convent gate, and, entering
the grounds, which were open
for the occasion, found the convent
all ablaze with lights. The parents
and friends of the young lady pupils
were permitted to attend the
midnight Christmas Mass. The
convent, and convent chapel which
communicated with it, stood in the
midst of winding walks and lawns
very pretty in the summer; but the
tall trees, now stripped of their
leaves, swung their bare branches
in the wind with a melancholy recollection
of their faded beauty.
Groups, in twos and threes, walked
silently up the paths, muffled in
cloaks and shawls, and disappeared
within the chapel. We were received
by the lady-superior, Mme.
P&mdash;&mdash;, whose kind voice and
refined and gentle manners were
sadly maligned by a formidable
Roman nose, that struck our youthful
minds with awe. What unprincipled
whims does Nature sometimes
take thus to impress upon
the countenance the appearance of
a character so alien to our true disposition!
Nor is it less true that
a beautiful face and a form that
Heaven has endowed with all the
charms of grace and fascinating
beauty may hide a soul rank with
vice and malice. The Becky
Sharpes of the world are not all
as ferret-featured as Thackeray’s
heroine, whom, nevertheless, with
much truth to art, he represents as
attractive and alluring in her prime.
But dear Mme. P&mdash;&mdash;’s Roman
nose was not, I have reason to believe,
without its advantages; the
fortuitous severity of its cast helping
to maintain a degree of discipline
among her young lady boarders,
which a tendency to what Mr.
Tennyson calls “the least little
delicate curve” (<i lang="la">vulgo</i>, a pug), or
even a purely classical Grecian,
might have failed to inspire. Forgive
me the treason if I venture
even to hint that those young ladies
in white and blue who floated in
and out of Mme. P&mdash;&mdash;’s parlors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
on reception-days, like angels cut
out from the canvas on the walls,
were ever less demure than their
prototypes!</p>

<p>We altar-boys were marshalled
into a long, narrow hall running
parallel with the chapel. There
we busied ourselves in putting
on our red <i lang="fr">soutanes</i> and white surplices,
and preparing the altar for
Mass. But we had a long time to
wait, and while we stood there in
whispering silence, and the chapel
slowly filled, suddenly appeared
Mme. P&mdash;&mdash; with a lay sister,
carrying six little china plates full
of red and white sugar-plums, and
some cakes not bigger than a
mouthful, to beguile our tedium.
To this day the sight of one of
those small plates, filled with that
kind of sugar-plums, brings back to
my mind with wonderful minuteness
all the scenes I have described
and those that followed. The long
walk through the snow, the guard-house,
the convent grounds, the figures
of Mme. P&mdash;&mdash; and her lay
sister advancing towards us, rise
before me undimmed by time; and
even now as I write the flavor of
the sugared cassia-buds seems to be
in my mouth, though it is over
twenty years ago since I cracked
them between my teeth with a
school-boy’s relish for sweetmeats.</p>

<p>The feeling of distant respect engendered
by the sight of Mme.
P&mdash;&mdash;’s nose gave way all at once
to a profound sympathy and admiration
for that estimable lady, as she
handed us those dainties. Yet, as
they disappeared before our juvenile
appetites, sharpened by the frost,
we could not help feeling all a boy’s
contempt for the girls that could be
satisfied with such stuff, instead of
a good, solid piece of gingerbread
that a fellow could get two or three
bites at! We had no doubt that the
convent girls had a <i lang="fr">congé</i> that day,
and that this was a part of the feast
that had been provided for them.</p>

<p>We marched gravely into the
sanctuary before Father W&mdash;&mdash;, and
took our places around the altar-steps
while he ascended the altar.
A deeper hush seemed to fall on
the congregation kneeling with
heads bowed down before the Saviour
born on that blessed morning.
The lights on the altar burned
with a mystical halo at the midnight
hour. The roses around the
Crib of the infant Redeemer
bloomed brighter than June. We
heaped the incense into the burning
censer, and the smoke rushed up in
a cloud, and the odorous sweetness
filled the air. Then along the
vaulted roof of the chapel stole the
first notes of the organ, now rising,
now falling; and the murmuring
voice of the priest was heard reading
the Missal. Did my heart stand
still when a boy&mdash;or is it touched
by a memory later?&mdash;as, birdlike,
the pure tones of the soprano rose,
filling the church, and thrilling the
whole congregation? Marvellous
magic of music! Can we wonder
to see an Arion borne by dolphins
over the waves, and stilling the
winds with his lyre? Poor Mme.
L&mdash;&mdash;! She had a voice of astonishing
brilliancy and power. Her
upper notes I have never heard excelled
in flute-like clearness and
sustained roundness of tone. When
I heard her years later, with a more
experienced ear, her voice, though a
good deal worn, was still one to be
singled out wherever it might be
heard. She is since dead. She
was a French lady of good family.
Her voice had the tone of an exile.
She sang the <cite>Adeste fideles</cite> on that
Christmas morning with a soul-stirring
pathos that impressed me so
much as a boy that the same hymn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
sung by celebrated singers and
more pretentious choirs, has always
appeared to me tame.</p>

<p>It would not serve my present
purpose to pursue these recollections
farther. Enough has been said to
show how quickly the mind grasps
at some one prominent point affected
by sense, to group around it a
tableau of associated recollections.
That little china tea-plate with its
blue and gilt edge, heaped over with
sugar-plums, brings back to me
scenes that seem to belong to another
age, so radical is the change
which time makes in the fortunes
and even emotions of men.</p>

<p>When the lights were all out in
the chapel, except those that burned
around the Crib, and the congregation
had silently departed, we wended
our way back to the college with
Father W&mdash;&mdash; in the chill morning
air more slowly than when we started;
sleepy, but our courage still
unabated by reason of the great
things we had shared in, and the
still greater things separated from
us by only one more, fast-coming
dawn. We slept like tops all the
morning, being excused from six
o’clock Mass on account of our
midnight excursion. When we joined
the home circle on Christmas
morning, you may be assured we
had plenty to talk about. Nor was
it until after dinner, and all the
walnuts had been cracked, and our
new pair of skates&mdash;our most prized
Christmas gift&mdash;tried on and
admired, that the recollection of
our first Christmas Mass began to
fade from our minds. Pure hearts
and innocent joys of youth! How
smooth the stream&mdash;<i lang="la">nescius auræ
fallacis</i>&mdash;on which it sails its tiny
craft! How rough the sea it drifts
into!</p>

<h3>FROM CAIRO TO JERUSALEM.</h3>

<p>Seated in the spacious hall of
the new hotel in Cairo, we discussed
a tour through the Holy
Land. We had quitted our comfortable
and home-like <i lang="ar">dahabéeah</i>,
wherein we had lived for nearly
four months upon the waters of the
historical Nile. A sad farewell had
been said to our trusty sailors, and
even those of them who had lingered
around the hotel for days after
our arrival, to kiss our hands as we
came out, had now taken their departure.
Old Abiad, our funny
man, had for once worn a sober
look as he bade us God-speed on
our homeward voyage. Said&mdash;the
indefatigable, hard-working, muscular
Said, ever ready for the hardest
work, and ever foremost in action&mdash;had
left us with tearful eyes, and
had started on his upward voyage
to Keneh, to marry the young Moslem
maiden to whom he had pledged
his troth some few months before.</p>

<p>Yes, the Nile trip was really over,
but on the tablets of memory was
painted a most bright and beautiful
picture, which time alone could efface.
Still another separation: one
of our party, having been in the
Holy Land the previous year, was
about to remain in Egypt, while the
rest of us visited Syria. Father
H&mdash;&mdash;, Mme. D&mdash;&mdash;, and the writer
made the travelling party. The
plans were soon settled, and a day
was appointed upon which we
should depart from Cairo to meet the
Russian steamer which was advertised
to leave Alexandria on Monday,
April the 13th, <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1874. One of
the greatest difficulties in travelling
in the East is to obtain accurate
information concerning the arrival
and departure of steamers and
trains. When inquiring what time
the train would leave Cairo for
Rhoda, the terminus of the railway
along the Nile, I was informed that
it would leave somewhere about
seven o’clock in the morning, and
would reach Rhoda between six
and eight in the evening; this was
the most accurate information I
could possibly obtain. In point of
fact, the train left Cairo at nine <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>,
and reached Rhoda at half-past ten
at night. On Monday morning,
April 13, there was a general clearing
out of travellers from the hotel.
At nine <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>&mdash;and, for a wonder,
punctual to the minute&mdash;we left
the station at Cairo on the train
going to Ismailïa. We passed
through some of the richest country
of the Delta, teeming with life
and activity. The <i lang="fr">Sagéars</i>, or Persian
water-wheels, were sending
their streams of life-giving water
through the numberless little canals
on every hand. Here a line of
laden camels march along with
stately step. There a family&mdash;father,
mother, and son&mdash;accompanied
by the omnipresent donkey,
called to mind the flight of the
Holy Family into Egypt. And
well they may; for here we are in
the land of Goshen, at Rameses,
the home of the Israelites, the
starting-point of their long, dreary
wanderings. Now the railroad
marks the line between the cultivated
land and the sandy plains of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
desert; on one side rich vegetation,
nurtured by the fresh-water canal,
on the other, sandy hillocks stretching
away to the line of the horizon;
and in a few moments we
see the deep, rich blue of the water
of Lake Timsah, contrasting most
strikingly with the golden sand of
its desert bank. Ismailïa! Ere the
train has stopped we are surrounded
by a crowd of Arabs thirsting
for their spoil. A score of them
pounce upon our baggage. After
considerable shouting and threatening,
we compromise, and a truce is
proclaimed. We engaged two of
them to carry our baggage to the
steamer on the lake. O porters of
the United States! how you would
blush and hang your heads in
shame to see these Arabs handle
baggage. In my childish and untravelled
simplicity I thought it
most wonderful to see you lift those
heavy boarding-houses, miscalled
trunks, and carry them to the fourth
story of a hotel. But hereafter, for
porters, commend me to the Arabs.
We had four or five heavy valises,
one of them weighing nearly one
hundred pounds, and numberless
small parcels. One of the men
hung these valises from his neck,
and tying the smaller parcels in
among them, as though by way of
ornament, started off, followed by
his brother porter, with our only
trunk, a large and very heavy one,
strapped on his back. They walked
at a brisk pace to the boat,
about one mile distant, and did not
seem in the least fatigued when they
arrived there. As we started to
walk down the long avenue leading
to the lake, we were beset as usual
by the importunities of three or
four donkey-boys, each one recounting
the praises of his own animal,
and speaking disparagingly of the
others, yet all in the best possible
humor. Running here and there,
dragging after them the patient
donkey, they cried out: “Him
good donkey, sah; look him. Oder
donkey no good; him back break.
Him exquisite donkey, sah! Him
Yankee Doodle!” Suddenly, in a fit
of indignation, I turned upon them
and howled at the top of my voice:</p>

<p>“Empshy Ya Kelb” (“Get out, O
dog!”), when, with a roar of laughter,
one little imp jumped in front
of me, and exclaimed: “Oh! Howadji
can speak Arabic. Him good
Arab donkey. Take him, sah; him
speak Arabic.” Notwithstanding
this great inducement, I did not
take him.</p>

<p>Like Aladdin’s palace, Ismailïa
has sprung up almost in a single
night. In 1860 the site of the present
town was a barren waste of sand;
but when the fresh-water canal was
completed to this place, and the
magic waters of the Nile were let
loose upon it, the golden sands of
the desert gave place to the rich
verdure of vegetation; gardens, filled
with the choicest fruits and flowers,
sprang up on every hand. Indeed,
it seems but necessary to pour the
waters of the Nile on the desert to
produce a soil which will grow anything
to perfection. Here we see
the pretty little Swiss <i lang="fr">châlet</i> of M. de
Lesseps, and a short distance beyond
the palace of the viceroy,
built in a few months, for the purpose
of entertaining his illustrious
guest at the opening of the Suez
Canal.</p>

<p>What singular fellows these Arabs
are! Our two porters demand
three rupees (a rupee is worth
about fifty cents) for their services.
I quietly take one rupee
from my pocket and offer it to
them. Indignantly they reject it;
and if I will not give them what
they ask, they will accept nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
at all; and with loud words and
angry gestures they shout and gesticulate
most vehemently, complaining
of the insignificant pittance
I offer them for the hard work they
have just gone through. I repocket
the rupee, and proceed very leisurely
to arrange our places on the
little postal boat, which is to leave
in about an hour. Having purchased
tickets, and seen that
everything was properly arranged,
I again return to the attack, as I am
now upon the offensive, and offer
them the rupee. No, they will not
have it; but now they will accept
two rupees. Well, it being the rule
of Eastern negotiations that as one
party comes down the other should
go up, like a balance, I increase
the rupee by a franc, and after
much talking they agree to accept
it. But now what a change comes
over them! Finding that they have
extracted from me all that they
possibly can, their whole manner
changes, and they become as polite
and affable as you please. They
thank me, proffer their services to
do anything for me that I may
wish, kiss their hands in respectful
salutation, and are off.</p>

<p>Our steamer is somewhat larger
than a man-of-war’s boat, and our
little company is soon assembled in
the cabin. Besides ourselves, there
are, first, a voluble young Russian
who came with us from Cairo, and
who precipitates himself most desperately
into the strongest friendships
that the time will allow with
every one he meets, telling you all
about himself and his family, and
then finding out as much as he
can about you and yours; next, a
stolid Saxon, Prussian vice-consul
at Cairo, a very pleasant and intelligent
young man; and, lastly, a
quiet, retiring young Italian lady,
who, unable to speak any language
besides her own, cannot join in the
general conversation, which is carried
on principally in French. At
six o’clock we left the landing-place
at Ismailïa, and, passing out the
northeast corner of Lake Timsah,
we entered the narrow cutting of
El Guisr. The surface of these
heights is the highest point in the
Isthmus of Suez, being from sixty
to sixty-five feet above the level
of the sea. In cutting the canal
through this part they were obliged
to dig down some ninety feet, in order
to give the canal its proper
depth below the sea level. Just
after we entered this cutting, the
strong north wind which was blowing
at the time caught madame’s
parasol, whirled it out of her hand,
blew it overboard, and the last we
saw of it it was floating placidly
along toward Suez. One sees here
how perceptibly the sand is filling
up the hard-won trench, and the
dredging-machines are kept in constant
operation to keep the channel
clear. At dusk we passed a
large English steamer tied up for
the night&mdash;as large steamers are
never allowed to travel in the canal
after dark.</p>

<p>We soon entered Lake Menzaleh,
and continued through it some
twenty-seven miles to Port Said.
Fifteen years ago a belt of sand,
from six to nine hundred feet in
width, occupied the place where
Port Said now stands. Here in
April, 1859, M. de Lesseps, surrounded
by a handful of Europeans
and a score of native workmen,
gave the first blow of the
spade to that great channel of communication
between the East and
the West. Soon the ground for the
future town was made, houses erected,
gardens laid out, and to-day
Port Said is a town of nearly ten
thousand inhabitants, with streets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
squares, gardens, docks, quays,
mosques, churches, and a very safe
and easily-approached harbor. The
name Port Said was given to it in
honor of the then viceroy, Said
Pasha. The next morning, when I
went to the office to purchase tickets,
I was informed, by the not over-polite
clerk in the Russian Steamship
Co.’s office, that notwithstanding
it was advertised that the steamer
would leave Alexandria on Monday,
it would not leave until Tuesday,
and consequently would not
leave Port Said until Wednesday
afternoon&mdash;another illustration of
the uncertainty of travelling information
in the East. In the afternoon
I determined to go down to the
lake and endeavor to shoot some
flamingoes or pelicans, both of
which abound here in great numbers.
Leaving the town, I started to
cross the wide, level plain which
separated it, as I supposed, from
the lake. Some distance ahead I
saw numerous birds disporting themselves
amid the glistening and
sparkling waters of the lake. After
walking for nearly an hour, I
reached the spot, but no lake was
there, and turning around, I saw it
at the point from which I had started.
Somewhat confused, I turned
towards the sea, and there I saw,
high up in the air, a sand-bank with
women walking upon it, and a little
further on two gigantic figures like
light-houses moving toward me in
the air. In a moment the truth
flashed upon me&mdash;it was a mirage;
and retracing my steps to the town,
I found that the lake was in a different
direction from the one I had
taken. The next day we went on
board the steamer, which arrived
from Alexandria about ten in the
morning. There is considerable excitement
on board, and a number of
smart-looking boats with trim crews
rapidly approaching us announce
the arrival of M. de Lesseps with
his wife and her two nieces, <i lang="fr">en route</i>
for a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.
M. de Lesseps is a man of medium
height, rather stout, and with a very
good-natured and jovial-looking
countenance. He wears a heavy gray
mustache, and his hair is silvery
white. His appearance is that of a
man of great energy and determination,
and one to project and carry
through the colossal work he has
so successfully executed. The
ship was very much crowded, or
perhaps it would be more correct
to say that the accommodations
were very limited, as we did not
have more than fifty first-class passengers
on board, and yet there
were not sufficient accommodations
for them in the first cabin. Father
H&mdash;&mdash; and I, together with a young
Austrian with whom we had become
acquainted at Port Said, were
obliged to sleep in a second-class
cabin. We were told that they
would so arrange it that we could
eat in the first saloon, and at dinner-time
we found a small work-table
set for four of us to eat from. However,
it was quite large enough
for me; for I had not been seated
many minutes before I felt an unaccountable
desire to go on deck and
inhale the fresh air.</p>

<p>Having done so, I retired for the
night. Bright and early the next
morning I was upon deck, but I
found Father H&mdash;&mdash; there before
me. Madame, having a very comfortable
room in the first cabin,
had not yet risen. The sea was
still and calm as a pond, and, turning
my face toward the east, I beheld
for the first time the mountain
ranges of Judæa. Yea, there before
me was Judæa, the land promised
and given to the seed of Abraham.
There, among those hills,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
Samson had performed his exploits
of power. There the royal David
and the wise Solomon had lived
and reigned. Ay, and there One
greater than them all, the Man-God,
was born, lived, and laid
down his life for the salvation of
mankind. And was it really true
that I, an inquisitive Yankee of the
XIXth century, was soon to tread
those sacred spots, hallowed with
reminiscences so dear to the heart
of every Christian? I could scarce
believe it. Was I not in a dream,
and would I not soon awake to
find it all a beautiful but fleeting
vision? No, it was true, and it was
made most painfully apparent by
the harsh clangor of the Arab
boatmen, and their frantic endeavors
to take possession of us, as our
ship dropped anchor off the town
of Jaffa. There is no harbor of
any kind here, and when the sea is
calm the steamers anchor about
one mile from the shore, and passengers
and their baggage are landed
in small boats. Immediately in
front of the town, and but a short
distance from it, a series of partially-covered
rocks forms a wall, broken
only by two channels or gateways,
one about ten feet in width,
and the other a little wider.
Through these the sea dashes with
tremendous fury, and as the little
boat approaches it is caught upon
the summit of some breaker, and
dashed through the opening into
the quiet haven behind. When it
is stormy, the steamers do not stop
here at all, but land their passengers
a short distance farther up the
coast. The bright, genial face of
Father Guido (president of the
Casa Nuova) soon welcomed us to
Palestine. He had come down
from Jerusalem to meet M. de
Lesseps, and to offer him the hospitality
of their convent, which
was thankfully accepted. We soon
disembarked and entered a small
boat, accompanied by our trusty
dragoman, Ali Aboo Suleyman,
who had travelled with one of our
party the previous year, and whom
I believe to be one of the best
dragomans in the East. Our boat,
propelled by the strong arms of a
half-score of powerful Arabs, soon
brought us alongside of the town.
Passing through a narrow gateway,
and giving a substantial and material
wink to the revenue official, we,
with our baggage, were soon deposited
at the door of the Latin convent.
After greeting the kind and
hospitable fathers, and arranging
terms with Ali, we started out for a
short walk. Traversing the narrow,
tortuous streets and filthy alleys,
jostled by camels, horses, donkeys,
and preceded by Achmud, Ali’s
youngest son&mdash;a lad of fourteen
years, who, with a pompous and
authoritative air, pushed aside old
men and young, women and children,
and would have done the
same with the camels had he been
able, to make room for the Howadji&mdash;we
reached the spot where
stood in former days the house of
Simon the tanner. Here the Apostle
Peter resided many days, and
here he saw the vision of the clean
and unclean beasts, wherein the
voice commanded him saying:
“Arise, Peter, kill and eat.” A
small mosque now occupies the
site of the house. The streets
were thronged with Russian pilgrims
returning from their Easter
pilgrimage to the Holy City.
Many of them will leave in the afternoon
on the steamer which has
brought us from Egypt, and in a
few short days will be at Odessa,
whence the railway will carry them
to St. Petersburg. About three in
the afternoon, accompanied by an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
Irish priest who had lived in Malta
for several years, we mounted our
horses and started for Jerusalem.
We had been most hospitably entertained
by the kind fathers at the
convent; a large room and an excellent
breakfast had been provided
for us, but no remuneration
asked. We, of course, made a donation,
which was thankfully received.
We rode through the narrow
streets, passed out the gate,
and in a few moments were among
the world-famous orange-groves of
Jaffa. The sky was cloudless, the
weather like a beautiful May day
at home, and the air heavy with
the delicious fragrance of the
oranges. We rode for nearly a
mile through these beautiful groves.
Meanwhile, Ali provided himself
with numbers of these large oranges,
and soon for the first time I tasted
an orange that I really enjoyed.
Just plucked from the tree, with
skin half an inch in thickness, and
without seeds, this luscious fruit
seems almost to dissolve in the
mouth like ice-cream. Ali owns a
large grove, from which he gathers
about one hundred and fifty thousand
oranges per annum. These
he sells in large quantities at the
rate of two pounds sterling per
thousand, yielding him a very nice
income, as the expense of taking
care of them is very small. Now
we are riding along the level plain
which separates the Judæan hills
from the bright blue waters of the
Mediterranean, and a little after six
o’clock we drew rein at the Latin
convent in Ramleh. It is almost
useless for me to speak of the kindness
and hospitality of these good
Franciscan fathers of the Holy
Land, as it is known throughout
the world, and abler pens than
mine have endeavored, but in vain,
to praise them as they deserve.
Unselfish, kind, burying self completely
in the great work they
have undertaken, they have given
up their homes, families, and all
that was dear to them, to live
a monastic life among these
sacred spots, to guard these
holy places, and, like ministering
angels, to assist pilgrims
from every clime and of every
Christian race and nationality.
Clad in the humble garb of their
order, they go quietly and unostentatiously
through life, sacrificing
themselves at every turn for the
benefit and comfort of others.
They have stood through centuries,
a devoted band of chivalrous
knights guarding the spots rendered
sacred by the presence of their
God. May he in his goodness reward
them by permitting them to
stand as a noble guard of honor
around his celestial throne in the
heavenly hereafter! After a comfortable
night’s rest and a good
breakfast, we started at six o’clock,
in order to avoid the intense heat
of midday. M. de Lesseps and
party had preceded us by nearly
two hours. As we rode out the
convent gate, numbers of lepers,
with shrunken limbs and distorted
countenances, clamored piteously
for alms. We dropped some small
coins into their tin boxes, which
they carry so that there may be
no possibility of contact with the
compassionate passer-by who may
bestow alms upon them. We rode
for some time across a level plain,
and near ten o’clock reached Bab-el-Wady
(Gate of the Valley), at the
foot of the mountain range. Here
we found a very comfortable house,
which has been erected for the
sake of affording accommodation to
pilgrims. We lunched here, took
a short nap, and started on our
way about two in the afternoon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
The whole distance from Jaffa to
Jerusalem is not over thirty-six
miles; but fast riding is not practicable
on account of the baggage,
which is transported on mules at a
very slow pace; consequently, it
generally requires two days to
make the trip, whereas a moderately
fast horse could easily accomplish
the journey in seven or eight
hours. We now enter Wady Ali.
One could scarcely imagine a more
suitable place for lurking bandits
to conceal themselves in than
among the thick undergrowth here.
Their musket-barrels might almost
touch their unconscious victim’s
breast, without being visible, and
many a tale has been told and retold
around the Howadji’s camp-fire
of their exploits of robbery and
murder in this place. But now,
thanks to the strict though tardy
vigilance of the sultan, the pass is
free from danger.</p>

<p>What feelings of emotion now
fill my breast! The dreams of my
childhood are being realized&mdash;I am
in the Holy Land! Reaching the
summit of one of the ridges, a beautiful
panorama is spread out before
us. At our feet lies the valley of
Sharon, dressed in the richest green,
and ornamented with the bright,
beautiful wild flowers of early
spring; beyond lies the plain of
Ramleh, and in the distance, like a
silver frame, sparkles and glistens
the bright waters of the Mediterranean.
Anon we see beneath us the
beautiful valley of Beit Hanina, and
Ali, laying one hand on my shoulder,
points to a little village nestled
amid the olive-groves in the valley.
Yes, that is Ain-Karim, the place of
the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin&mdash;the
spot where was born the
“greatest of men.” We check our
horses but for a moment; we have
no eyes for that now. Every gaze is
fixed upon that small yellow house
upon the top of the opposite hill;
for has not Ali told us that from that
point we shall see the Eternal City?
Riding rapidly down the mountain-side,
we do not even stop as we
cross the brook&mdash;where David gathered
the pebbles with which he slew
his gigantic adversary&mdash;and push
rapidly up the opposite mountain.
Father H&mdash;&mdash; and I are in advance,
while madame rides behind with the
Irish priest. The shades of evening
are now falling, and I fear lest night
may come on before we reach the
city. Scarce a word is spoken; my
heart beats with excitement, such
as it has never known before, and
seems as though it would break
through its prison-house, so eager,
so anxious, is it to move quickly on.
Unable to restrain my impatience,
I give my horse a blow with my
riding-whip, and he starts on a full
run. Father H&mdash;&mdash; calls me back.
We have travelled so long and shared
so many pleasures together, let us
together share the great pleasure of
the first sight of Jerusalem. I rein
in my horse, and ride by his side.
Now the top of the hill is reached,
and it is yet light; but we have mistaken
the house&mdash;it is another one
still farther on. It is now twilight.
We speak not a word, but, bent forward,
we scan the horizon with
piercing eyes, as though we would
penetrate the mountains themselves,
so eager are we to see the city. I
hail a passing boy: “Fin el Kuds?”
(“Where is Jerusalem?”), but with a
stupid stare he passes on. A few
moments more the house is reached,
and Sion, royal city of David, lies
before us! Waiting until the rest
of the party ride up, we dismount,
kneel, kiss the ground, and then
recite aloud the psalm <cite>Lætatus Sum</cite>,
a Pater Noster, and an Ave Maria,
remount, enter the city by the Jaffa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
gate, ride to our comfortable quarters
at the Latin Hospice, and <em>are in
Jerusalem</em>.</p>

<p>At the convent we were entertained
in the most hospitable manner,
and provided with the neatest
and tidiest of rooms. Early the
next morning Father H&mdash;&mdash; and I
sallied forth to call on Père Ratisbonne.
Following the Via Sacra,
we stopped before an iron gate a
short distance below the arch Ecce
Homo, and little Achmud, picking
up a large stone, pounded upon it
as though he were repaying a
grudge which he had cherished
against it for centuries. I ventured
to remonstrate, suggesting that they
might be displeased at so much
noise being made. But he answered
very coolly&mdash;meanwhile continuing
the pounding as if his future
happiness depended upon making a
hole in the door&mdash;that he wanted to
inform those inside that some visitors
wished to call upon them. I
said nothing, but doubted seriously
whether that would be the impression
produced on their minds. Had
it been in America, and had I been
inside, I should have imagined that
it was an election row, or a fire during
the reign of the volunteer fire
department. But notwithstanding
all this, no one appeared, and we
moved away disgusted, only to find
that we had been at the wrong
place, and to be farther informed
that Père Ratisbonne was in Paris.</p>

<p>What shall I say of the sacred
spots of Jerusalem, which so many
abler pens than mine have attempted
to describe?&mdash;vainly endeavoring
to portray the inexpressible
emotions that crowd the breast of
every Christian as he kneels before
them for the first time! Perhaps I
can convey to my readers some idea
of the feeling which continually pervaded
my whole being. It was as
if the curtain of the past had been
rolled back, placing me face to face
with the living actors in that great
tragedy of our Redemption eighteen
hundred years ago. What contributed
in a great measure to this was
that we had lived during the winter
in an atmosphere of three or four
thousand years ago. We had scarcely
esteemed it worth while to look at
the ruins of the Ptolemys, they seemed
so recent after the massive temples
of the Rameses and the Ositarsens,
and now the beginning of the
Christian era appeared but an affair
of yesterday. The Adamic and Mosaic
dispensations seemed a little
old, ’tis true, but the Christian dispensation
was yet to us in all the
glory of its early morn. I felt, as I
crossed the Kedron and read the
Holy Gospels seated beneath the
olive-trees in the garden of Gethsemane,
as if even I had been a
personal follower of the Man-God,
and in imagination could hear the
hosannas of praise as he rode past
me on the ass on the way from
Bethany. Before this religion had
seemed to me more like an intellectual
idea. Now I felt that I knew
Him as a friend, and my heart beat
earnest acquiescence to Father
H&mdash;&mdash;’s remark: “Coming from
Egypt, Christ appears a modern
personage; and the visit to the
sacred places of Palestine adds to
the intellectual and moral conviction
of the truth of Christianity,
the feeling and strength of personal
friendship with its Author.”</p>

<p>On Sunday Father H&mdash;&mdash; celebrated
Mass at the altar erected on
the spot where the Blessed Virgin
stood during the Crucifixion. The
hole in the rock wherein the sacred
cross was planted belongs to the
Greeks, and over it they have erected
an altar, loaded down, like all
their other altars, with tawdry finery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
On another occasion I had the
happiness to serve Father H&mdash;&mdash;’s
Mass on the spot where our Lord
was nailed to the cross. But the
greatest happiness of all was reserved
for the morning we left the Holy
City, when madame and I received
Holy Communion from the hands of
Father H&mdash;&mdash;, who celebrated Mass,
which I served, in the Holy Sepulchre
itself. <i lang="la">Hic Jesus Christus
sepultus est.</i> In that little tomb the
three of us, who had shared together
the pleasures and dangers of a long
voyage in Egypt and Nubia&mdash;here
on the very spot where He was entombed,
we alone, in early morn, received
his sacred body and blood,
giving fresh life and courage to our
souls for our future struggles with the
world. How much better, instead
of incrusting the sepulchre with
marble and gems, to have left it as
it was, rude and simple as when the
Man-God was laid in it! But one
sacred spot is left in its primitive
state&mdash;the grotto of the Agony. A
simple altar has been erected in it,
and a marble tablet let into the wall
with this inscription upon it: “Hic
factus est sudor ejus sicut guttæ
sanguinis decurrentis in terram.”
The walls and roof of the grotto
are to-day as they were that terrible
night when they witnessed the
sweat as drops of blood rolling
down his sacred face.</p>

<p>The limits of this article will not
permit me to tell how we wandered
reverentially along the Via Sacra,
or gazed in admiration from
Olivet’s summit on Jerusalem the
Golden lying at our feet; of our interesting
visit to the residence of the
Princesse de La Tour d’Auvergne,
on the spot where the apostles were
taught the Lord’s Prayer, which
she has inscribed on the court-yard
walls in every written language. I
could tell of our visit to the <i lang="la">Cœnaculum</i>
to the Temple, the tomb of the
Blessed Virgin, our walks through
the Valley of Jehoshaphat; but these
descriptions are so familiar to every
Christian that I will content myself
with relating more of the personal
incidents which befell us than general
descriptions of what we saw.</p>

<p>Father H&mdash;&mdash; and I left Jerusalem
on Tuesday morning, and, after
riding several hours, camped for the
night near the Greek convent of
Mars Saba. No woman is allowed
to enter this convent, and men only
with permission of the Greek Patriarch
of Jerusalem. We visited the
tomb of S. Saba, model of anchorites,
and saw in one room the skulls of
fourteen thousand of his brethren,
most of them massacred by the Bedouins.
Rev. Mr. Chambers, of New
York, with two young friends, was
encamped near us, and we spent a
very pleasant evening in their tent.
At five o’clock the next morning we
were in the saddle, <i lang="fr">en route</i> for the
Dead Sea. We had a Bedouin escort,
who was attired in a dilapidated,
soiled night-shirt, and was scarcely
ever with us, either taking short
cuts down the mountain-side&mdash;as he
was on foot&mdash;and getting far in advance
of us, or lagging equally as
far in the rear. Nevertheless, it
was a powerful escort&mdash;had we not
paid the sheik of the tribe five dollars
for it? and did it not represent
the force and power of a mighty
tribe of Bedouins? In sober
earnest, this hatless, shoeless escort
was a real protection; for if
we had been attacked while he
was with us, his tribe, or the sheik
of it, would have been forced by the
authorities to make good our loss,
and, moreover, the attacking tribe
would have incurred the enmity of
our escort’s tribe&mdash;a very serious
thing in this part of the world, and
among men whose belief is: Whoso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall
his blood be shed. The Bedouins
find this way of robbing travellers
more profitable than the old-time
system of taking their victim’s property
<i lang="la">vi et armis</i>, for in the latter
instance they are liable to be pursued,
caught, and punished; while
in the former, by exacting a fee
from the traveller and furnishing
an escort in return, they make considerable
money without fear of
punishment. While riding along toward
the Dead Sea, I frequently
dismounted to shoot partridges, and
on remounting I took out the cartridges
which had not been used,
before handing my gun to the escort,
who carried it for me. On one occasion,
when near the Dead Sea,
I had pursued several partridges,
but did not get a shot at them, and
returning to my horse, held by the
escort, I was about to draw out the
cartridges when he requested me
to let them remain, so that I should
not have the trouble of reloading
for the next shot. I shook my
head with a negative motion, when
he replied in an humble tone:
“Very well. I am a Bedouin, and of
course you cannot trust me.” And
then flashed across my mind that
terrible curse pronounced upon Ishmael
and his descendants: “His
hand shall be against every man,
and every man’s against him.”
Feeling sorry for the poor fellow, I
looked him straight in the eye, as
though expressing my confidence
in him, and handed him the loaded
gun. I was alone with him now, as
the rest of the party had ridden on
a mile or two in advance. But I
felt perfectly safe, because he was
walking ahead of me, and, had he
meditated treachery, I had my revolver
in my belt, and could have
killed him before he could raise the
gun to shoot. However, I presume
that he simply wanted to play
sportsman himself; for when he returned
me the gun, some hours afterwards,
both barrels were empty.
About ten o’clock we reached the
barren shores of the Dead Sea,
passing, very close to it, numberless
heaps of cinders, indicating a recent
Bedouin encampment. We took a
long bath in these buoyant waters.
I sank as far as my neck, and then
walked through the water as though
on land. I remained nearly an hour
in the water without touching the
bottom. It is very difficult to swim,
as, when one assumes the swimming
position, the legs are thrown half
out of the water. These waters,
covering the site of Sodom and Gomorrha,
are clear as crystal, yet to
the taste are bitter as gall. Riding
along the plain for a short hour,
we entered the luxurious vegetation
on the banks of the Jordan, and
dismounted near the place where
S. John baptized our Lord. Swift-flowing,
muddy, turbulent Jordan!
shall I ever forget thee or
the pleasant swim I had in thy
sweet waters? Father H&mdash;&mdash; and
I dozed for about an hour, took a
lunch, and then, remounting, rode
across the level plain of Jericho,
and about five o’clock reached our
tent, pitched on the site of ancient
Jericho, at the foot of the Mount of
Temptation, where Satan would
tempt our Lord with the vain, fruitless
riches of this world. After
dinner we walked a short distance,
and sat down on the limb of a
tree overhanging the sweet waters
of the heaven-healed fountain of
Elisha. Surrounded by armed
Bedouins, who watched our every
motion with eager curiosity, and
occasionally in plaintive tones requested
<i lang="fa">backsheesh</i>, we passed a delightful
hour recalling the sacred
reminiscences connected with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
spots around us. Behind us a
crumbling ruin marks the site of
once proud Jericho&mdash;the city to
which the warlike Joshua sent the
spies from the Moabitish hills beyond
the Jordan; the city destroyed
by the Israelitish trumpet-blast,
and against which the terrible curse
was pronounced: “Cursed be the
man before the Lord that riseth up,
and buildeth this city Jericho: he
shall lay the foundation thereof in
his first-born, and in his youngest
son he shall set up the gates of it”&mdash;a
curse which was most fearfully
fulfilled. Yonder Elijah went up
to heaven in a whirlwind. Far
away in the distance the Dead Sea,
hemmed in by its mountain banks,
lies calm and placid in the dying
sunset. At our feet is the broad
plain of Jericho, and at our back
the mountains of Judæa. How
singular it must have seemed to the
Israelites when they first saw mountains
covered with trees and verdure!
In their old Egyptian home
they had seen but sand-mountains,
the vegetation in no place extending
beyond the level ground; and
now for the first time after their
dreary desert wanderings they saw
the vegetation creeping up the
mountain-side even to its summit,
and thousands of sheep browsing
upon it on every hand. Early the
next morning we were in the saddle,
<i lang="fr">en route</i> for Jerusalem, and,
passing the spot where the good
Samaritan ministered to the poor
man who had fallen among thieves,
we reached Bethany about noon.
Procuring some tapers from an old
woman, we descended into the
tomb from which the voice of his
God had called forth the dead
Lazarus. A flight of steps leads
down some distance into a small
chamber, which is to-day in the
same condition as when Martha’s
brother, arising from the dead, testified
to the assembled crowd the
power of Jesus of Nazareth. From
here we ascended Olivet, and from
its summit looked with admiration
upon the beautiful panorama spread
out beneath us, and lunched under
the venerable olive-trees, which
perhaps had cast their shade upon
the weary form of our Saviour, and
had witnessed the glorious miracle
of his Ascension. Soon after we
reached our convent home.</p>

<p>The Jews in the Holy City are
much fairer than their brethren in
America. They wear the old-time
gabardine, belted at the waist and
extending to the ankles; on the
head a high black felt hat with
broad brim, while two curls hang
down the cheek on either side.
They are a sorrowful-looking race,
fascinating to gaze upon as connected
with the great Drama, yet
inspiring me at the same time with
a feeling of disgust which I could
not control. How striking a picture
of their degradation and fall
from their once proud estate as the
chosen ones of God, is shown as
they gather on Fridays to their
wailing-place; five courses of large
bevelled stones being all that remain
of Solomon’s grand Temple!
Here are Jews of all ages and of
both sexes, crying bitterly over fallen
Jerusalem. Old men, tottering
up, bury their faces in the joints
and cavities, and weep aloud as
though their hearts were breaking,
while in chorus comes the low,
plaintive wail of the women. In
and among, and around and about
them, with shouts of mirth and
laughter, play the children of the
Arab conquerors. The Jews are
permitted to weep here unmolested.</p>

<p>On Sunday afternoon, accompanied
by Father Guido, we went
to Bethlehem. We passed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
night in the Latin convent,
and the next morning madame
and I received Holy Communion
from the hands of Father
H&mdash;&mdash;, who celebrated Mass in
the Crib of the Nativity, on the
spot where the Wise Men stood
when adoring the new-born Babe.
The very spot where Christ was
born is marked by a silver star,
with this inscription upon it: “Hic
de Virgine Maria Jesus Christus
Natus est.” The star belongs to
the Latins, but the altar over it to
the Greeks, who have several times
attempted to carry off the star, but
unsuccessfully. They, of course,
will not permit the Latins to celebrate
Mass upon the altar. The
Greeks, being more powerful, are
continually harassing and heaping
all sorts of indignities upon the
Latins, who are obliged to submit
to them. Shame upon the Catholic
nations of Europe&mdash;nations
which in bygone times sent forth
those noble bands of Crusaders,
sacrificing their lives to rescue the
holy places from infidel hands!
But Easter a year ago they destroyed
the valuable hangings in
the Holy Crib, presented to the
Latins by the French government,
and stole two pictures from their
altars valued at six thousand dollars
apiece. Nay, more than this:
they even severely wounded with a
sword the Franciscan brother who
endeavored to prevent the execution
of their nefarious designs.
And again the past Easter, but a
few days before we were there, witnessed
another of these terrible
scenes of barbarism and inhumanity.
A number of unoffending pilgrims,
just returned from their annual
Easter visit to the Jordan, were
denied entrance by the Greeks to
the basilica over the Holy Crib.
And when they insisted upon entering
the church&mdash;which is common
property, and in which they had a
perfect right to go&mdash;and attempted
to force their way in, they were arrested
by the Turkish governor of
Bethlehem&mdash;who is in league with
the Greeks&mdash;under the pretext that
they were inciting to riot, and cast
into a loathsome dungeon in Jerusalem.
But, thanks to the exertions
of M. de Lesseps, they were subsequently
released.</p>

<p>I rode over to the hill where the
shepherds watched their flocks
that eventful night when the angels
announced to them the “glad tidings
of great joy.” In the afternoon
we rode across the mountains
to Ain-Karim, the birth-place of
S. John the Baptist.</p>

<p>The women in this part of the
country, but particularly in Bethlehem
and its vicinity, carry all
their fortunes on their heads.
Dressed in the picturesque garb of
the Moabitish women, their coins
are hung in great numbers from
their caps. One young mother, with
her babe in her arms, and with
her cap almost covered with rows
of gold coins, approached me at
Ain-Karim, and begged me in a
piteous tone for a copper, and appeared
delighted when I gave it to
her. They would almost sooner
starve than part with these coins,
in which they take great pride; but
I imagine that after they are married
their husbands find means of
obtaining possession of them, and
then they get into general circulation
again. We went to see the
scene of the Visitation, over which
an altar had been erected in the
early ages of Christianity, but which
had been concealed for centuries,
and only accidentally discovered of
late by the Latins in renovating
their church. Alongside the altar
is the impression of a baby in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
rock. It is said that when Herod’s
soldiers came to the house of S.
Elizabeth to execute their master’s
murderous commands to massacre
the little innocents, the saintly mother
pressed her infant against the
wall, which opened, received him,
and then, closing again, hid him
from view; and thus was he saved
to grow up a voice crying in the
wilderness, “Make straight the way
of the Lord.” We spent the night
in the convent built on the site of
the house where was born this
“greatest of men.” The next day
we returned to Jerusalem, visiting
<i lang="fr">en route</i> the Greek church on the
spot where grew the tree from
which the sacred cross was made.</p>

<p>Shortly after this we left the Holy
City, soon bade farewell to our
trusty dragoman, and embarked on
the <i>Tibre</i> at Jaffa, bound for Marseilles.
Oh! what impressions were
made upon me by my short sojourn
among those sacred places. How
my faith was strengthened, and my
love and devotion increased, and
how earnestly and often I wished,
and still wish, that each and every
one I know could see what I have
seen and feel as I now feel!</p>

<p>Exeter Beach was divided into
two distinct parts by a line of cliff
jutting far out into Exeter Bay.
Below the eastern face of the cliff
lay the Moore estate, and then
came the town; but on the west
side was an inlet, backed by dense
woods, and bounded on the farther
extremity by another wall of rock.
This was known as Lonely Cove,
and deserved its title. From it one
looked straight out to the open
sea; no island intervened, nor was
anything visible on shore save the
two long arms of frowning rock,
the circuit of pine coming close to
the edge of drift-wood that marked
the limit of the tide, and, at the
far distance, a solitary house.
This had once been occupied by a
man who made himself a home
apart from every one, and died as
lonely as he lived; since then it
had been deserted, and was crumbling
to decay, and many believed it
to be haunted.</p>

<p>Along this beach, about three
o’clock one Christmas Eve, Jane
Moore was walking. It was a dull
afternoon, with a lowering sky, and
a chill in the air which foreboded
rain rather than snow; but, wrapped
in her velvet cloak and furs of
costly sable, Jane did not heed the
weather.</p>

<p>Her heart was full to overflowing.
From the first Christmas that she
could remember to the one previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
to his death, she had taken that
walk with her father every Christmas
eve, while he talked with her
of the joy of the coming day, sang
to her old Christmas carols, and
sought to prepare her for a holy as
well as a merry feast. He had tried
to be father and mother both to his
motherless girl, but his heart ached
as he watched her self-willed, imperious
nature, often only to be curbed
by her extreme love for him.</p>

<p>“Be patient, my friend,” the old
priest who knew his solicitude used
to say. “It is a very noble nature.
Through much suffering and failure,
it may be, but <em>surely</em>, nevertheless,
our Jane will live a grand life yet
for the love of God.” And so
James Moore strove to believe and
hope, till death closed his eyes
when his daughter was only thirteen
years old.</p>

<p>Heiress of enormous wealth, and
of a beauty which had been famous
in that county for six generations,
loving keenly all that was fair, luxurious,
and intellectual, Jane Moore
was one of the most brilliant women
of her day. Dancing and riding,
conversation and music&mdash;she threw
herself into each pursuit by turn
with the same whole-hearted <em>abandon</em>
which had ever characterized
her. Yet the priest who had baptized
her, and who gave her special,
prayerful care and direction, laid
seemingly little check upon her.
Such religious duties as were given
her she performed faithfully; she
never missed the daily Mass or
monthly confession; not a poor
cottage in the village in which she
was not known and loved, though
as yet she only came with smiles
and money and cheery words, instead
of personal tendance and
real self-denial. No ball shortened
her prayers, no sport hindered her
brief daily meditation. The priest
knew that beyond all other desires
that soul sought the Lord; beyond
all other loves, loved him; and
that she strove, though poorly and
imperfectly and with daily failure,
to subject her will to the higher
will of God. To have drawn the
curb too tightly then might have
been to ruin all; the wise priest
waited, and, while he waited, he
prayed.</p>

<p>This Christmas Eve on which
Jane Moore was speeding along
the beach was the last she would
ever spend as a merry girl in her
old home. As a wife, as a mother,
she might come there again, but
with Epiphany her girlhood’s days
must end. Her heart, once given,
had been given wholly, and Henry
Everett was worthy of the gift; but
the breaking of old ties told sorely
upon Jane, who always made her
burdens heavier than need be by
her constant endeavor to gain her
own will and way. Her handsome
face looked dark and sallow that
afternoon; the thin, quivering nostrils
and compressed lips told of a
storm in her heart.</p>

<p>“I cannot understand it,” she
said aloud. “<em>Why</em> must I go
away? Surely it was right to wish
to live always in my old home
among my father’s people. <em>Why</em>
should God let Henry’s father live
and live and live to be ninety years
old, and he be mean and troublesome?
and <em>why</em> should my dear father
die young, when I needed him?
I cannot bear to go away.”</p>

<p>And then came to her mind
words said to her that very day&mdash;few
words, but strong, out of a wise
and loving heart&mdash;“God asks something
from you this Christmas, in the
midst of your joy, which I believe
he will ask from you, in joy or sorrow,
all your life long until he gets
it. He wants the entire surrender<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
of your will. I do not know how
he will do it, but I am sure he will
never let you alone till he has
gained his end. Make it your
Christmas prayer that he will teach
you that his will is better and
sweeter than anything our wills
may crave.”</p>

<p>She flew faster along the beach,
striving by the very motion to find
relief for the swelling of her heart.</p>

<p>“I cannot bear it,” she cried&mdash;“to
have always to do something I do
not want to do! I cannot bear it.
Yes, I can, and I will. God help
me! But I cannot understand.”</p>

<p>On, on, faster still, sobs choking
her, tears blinding her. “I wanted
so much to live and die here. God
must have known it, and what difference
could it make to him?”</p>

<p>“Don’t ye! Don’t ye, Tom!
Ye’ve no right. Ye mustn’t, for
God’s sake.” The words, in a
woman’s shrill voice, as of one
weak with fasting or illness,
yet strong for the instant with
the strength of a great fear or
pain, broke in upon Jane’s passion,
and, coming to herself, she found
that she was close to the Haunted
House. Fear was unknown to her;
in an instant she stood within the
room.</p>

<p>Evidently some tramp, poorer
than the poorest, had sought shelter&mdash;little
better than none, alas!&mdash;in
the wretched place. A haggard
woman was crouching on a pile of
sea-weed and drift-wood, holding
tightly to something hidden in the
ragged clothing huddled about her,
striving to keep it&mdash;whatever it
might be&mdash;from the grasp of a desperate,
half-starved man who bent
over her.</p>

<p>“Gie it to me,” he cried. “I tell
ye, Poll, I’ll have it, that I wull, for
all ye. And I’ll trample it, and I’ll
burn it, that I wull. No more carrying
o’ crucifixes for we, and I
knows on’t. Gie us bread and
butter, say I, and milk for the babby
there.”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay, Tom,” the woman
pleaded. “It’s Christmas Eve.
He’ll send us summat the night,
sure. Wait one night, Tom.”</p>

<p>“Christmas! What’s him to we?
Wait! Wait till ye starve and freeze
to death, lass; but I’ll not do’t.
There’s no God nowhere, and no
Christmas&mdash;it’s all a sham&mdash;and
there sha’n’t be no crucifixes neither
where I bes. Ha! I’s got him now,
and I’ll have my own way, lass.”</p>

<p>“Stop, man!” Jane stood close
beside him, with flashing eyes and
her proud and fearless face. “Give
me the crucifix,” she said.</p>

<p>But she met eyes as fearless as
her own, which scanned her from
head to foot. “And who be you?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Jane Moore,” she answered,
with the ring that was always in her
voice when she named her father’s
honored name.</p>

<p>“And what’s that to me?” the
man exclaimed. “Take’s more’n
names to save this.” And he shook
the crucifix defiantly.</p>

<p>“Stop, stop!” Jane cried. “I will
pay you well to stop.”</p>

<p>“Why then, miss?”</p>

<p>“Your God died on a cross,”
Jane answered. “You shall not
harm his crucifix.”</p>

<p>“Speak for yourself, miss! Shall
not? My wull’s as strong as yours,
I’ll warrant. God! There’s no
God; else why be ye in velvets and
her in rags? That’s why I trample
this ’un.”</p>

<p>In another moment the crucifix
would have lain beneath his heel;
but Jane flung herself on her knees.
All pride was gone; tears rained
from her eyes; she, who had been
used to command and to be obeyed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
pleaded like a beggar, with humble
yet passionate pleading, at the feet
of this beggar and outcast.</p>

<p>“Wait, wait,” she cried. “Oh!
hear me. Truly your God was
born in a stable and died upon a
cross. He loves you, and he was
as poor as you.”</p>

<p>“There be no God,” the man reiterated
hoarsely. “It’s easy for
the likes o’ ye to talk, all warm and
full and comfortable.”</p>

<p>Jane wrung her hands. “I cannot
explain,” she said, “I cannot understand.
But it must be that God
knows best. He sent me. Come
home with me, and I will give you
food and clothes and money.”</p>

<p>“Not I,” cried the man defiantly.
“I knows that trick too well, miss.
Food and clothes belike, but a jail
too. I’ll trust none. Pay me
here.”</p>

<p>Jane turned her pocket out. “I
have nothing with me,” she said.
“Will you not trust me?” But in
his hard-set face she read her answer
while she spoke.</p>

<p>“Very well,” she continued.
“Take a note from me to my steward.
He will pay you.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see’t,” was the brief reply.
Hastily she wrote a few words in
pencil, and he read them aloud.</p>

<p>“Now, miss,” he said, “it’s not
safe for me to be about town much
’fore dark, and, what’s more, I won’t
trust ye there neither. Here ye’ll
bide the night through, if ye means
what ye says.”</p>

<p>“O Tom!” the woman exclaimed,
breaking silence for the first
time since Jane spoke, “’twull be
a fearful night for the like o’ she.”</p>

<p>“Let her feel it, then,” he retorted.
“Wasn’t her Lord she talks on born
in the cold and the gloom to-night,
’cording to you and she, lass? Let
her try’t, say I, and see what she’ll
believe come morn.”</p>

<p>Like a flash it passed through
Jane’s mind that her last midnight
Mass among her own people was
taken from her; that, knowing her
uncertain ways, no one would think
of seeking her till it was too late,
any more than her steward, well
used to her impulses, would dream
of questioning a note of hers, no
matter who brought it. Yet with
the keen pang of disappointment a
thrill of sweetness mingled. Was
not her Lord indeed born in the
cold and the gloom that night? “I
am quite willing to wait,” she said
quietly.</p>

<p>The man went to the door.
“Tide’s nigh full,” he said, “and
night’s nigh here. I’ll go my ways.
But mark ye, miss, I’ll be waiting
t’other side, to see ye don’t follow.
Trust me to wait patient, till it’s too
dark for ye to come.”</p>

<p>Jane watched him till he had
reached the further line of the cliff;
then she buried her face in her
hands. Space and time seemed as
nothing; again, as for years she had
been used to do, she strove to place
herself in the stable at Bethlehem,
and the child-longing rose within
her to clasp the Holy Infant in her
arms, and warm him at her heart,
and clothe him like a prince. And
then she remembered what the man
had said: “It’s easy for the likes o’
ye to talk, all warm and full and
comfortable.”</p>

<p>There are natures still among us
that cannot be content unless they
lavish the whole box of ointment
on the Master’s feet. Jane turned
to the heap of sea-weed where the
half-frozen woman lay. “Can you
rise for a minute?” she asked gently.
“I am going to change clothes
with you. Yes, I am strong, and can
walk about and bear it all; but you
will freeze if you lie here.” And putting
down the woman’s feeble resistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
with a bright, sweet will, Jane
had her way.</p>

<p>Half exhausted, her companion
sank back upon her poor couch,
and soon fell asleep; and when the
baby woke, Jane took it from her,
lest its pitiful wailing should rouse
the mother, to whom had come
blessed forgetfulness of her utter
inability to feed or soothe it. She
wrapped the child in her rags, and
walked the room with it for hours
that night. It seemed to her that
they must freeze to death if she
stopped. For a time the wind
raged furiously and the rain fell in
torrents; no blessed vision came
to dispel the darkness of her vigil;
no ecstasy to keep the cold from
biting her; she felt its sting sharply
and painfully the whole night
through. The first few hours were
the hardest she had ever spent, yet
she would not have exchanged
them for the sweetest joy this world
had ever given her. “My Lord
was cold,” she kept saying. “My
Lord was cold to-night.”</p>

<p>By and by&mdash;it seemed to her that
it must be very late&mdash;the storm
passed over. She went to the
door. The clouds were lifting, and
far away the sea was glimmering
faintly in the last rays of a hidden
and setting moon. Below a mass
of dark clouds, and just above the
softly-lighted sea, shone out a large
white star. Across the water, heaving
heavily like one who has fallen
asleep after violent weeping, and
still sobs in slumber, came to her
the sound of the clock striking midnight;
and then all the chimes rang
sweetly, and she knew that the
Mass she had longed for had begun.</p>

<p>“I cannot bear it!” she cried;
then felt the child stir on her
breast, and, gathering it closer to
her, she said slowly: “God understands.
His way must be best.”
And she tried to join in spirit with
those in church who greeted the
coming of the Lord.</p>

<p>Surely there was some reason for
her great disappointment and for
her suffering that night. Reason?
Was it not enough to be permitted
thus to share His first night of deprivation?
And presently she began
to plan for herself God’s plan&mdash;how
the man would return, and
find her there wet and cold and
hungry, and would learn why she
had done it, and would never
doubt God again. She fancied
them all at home with her, employed
by her, brought back to a happy,
holy life; and she prayed long and
earnestly for each.</p>

<p>He did come, as soon as the gray
morning twilight broke&mdash;came with
haste, bade his wife rise, and take
her child and follow him. He gave
no time for the words Jane wished
to speak; but when the woman said
that she must return the garments
which had kept her warm, and perhaps
alive, that night, Jane cried
“No, no! It is as if I had kept
our Lady warm for once, and carried
her Child, not yours.” And
she clasped the baby passionately,
kissing it again and again.</p>

<p>The man stood doubtful, then
tore the rich cloak from his wife’s
shoulders, seized the mean one
which it had replaced, wrapped her
in it, hiding thus the costly attire,
that might have caused suspicion,
then looked about the room.</p>

<p>“The crucifix?” he said.</p>

<p>“Is it not mine?” Jane asked.</p>

<p>He pointed to the woman. “It’s
her bit o’ comfort,” he said. “Gie
it to her, miss. Plenty ye’s got, I
wot. I’ll ne’er harm ’un again.”</p>

<p>There was no more farewell than
that; no more promise of better
things. In a few minutes they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
disappeared among the pines; and
cold, suffering, disheartened, Jane
made her way homeward. To her
truest home first; for bells were
ringing for first Mass, and Jane
stole into church, and, clad in beggar’s
rags beneath her velvet cloak,
knelt in real humility to receive her
Lord. “I do not understand,” she
said to him, sobbing softly. “Nothing
that I do succeeds as I like.
But, my Jesus, I am sure thy will
is best, only I wanted so much to
help them for thee. Why was it,
my Jesus?”</p>

<p>But the years went by, and
though Christmas after Christmas
Jane remembered with a pang that
great disappointment, her longings
and her questions remained unanswered.</p>

<p>And so it was in almost everything.
Her life after that strange
Christmas Eve was one of constant,
heroic, personal service for others,
in the love of the Sacred Heart of
Jesus. The brilliant woman was
never seen again at ball or hunt,
but beside the beds of the sick and
suffering she was daily to be found,
making the most painful, repulsive
cases her special care. And
she, who had delighted in daintiest
apparel, never wore again after that
Christmas morning jewels or costly
clothing. “I have tasted once the
sweetness of faring like my Lord,”
she said impetuously to her husband.
“Do not break my heart
by making me all warm and full
and comfortable again.” And he,
whose high soul answered nobly to
her own, never tried to hold her
back, but followed her eagerly in
her earnest following of her Lord.</p>

<p>Yet the self-willed nature cost its
owner many sufferings before it
learned submission to the divine
Master. It pleased God that Jane
Everett should live to an advanced
and very strong old age, and it also
pleased him through all those years
to conform her will to his by constant
and peculiar trials. The husband
whom she loved with an almost
idolatrous love was taken from
her, without an instant’s warning, by
a fearful accident. Her sons, whom
she dedicated to God’s holy priesthood,
died in their cradles; her
daughters grew into the fairest
bloom of womanhood, only to become
the brides of death. Yet nothing
quenched the fire in her eye,
and the cry of her heart for years
was still its old cry: “O God! I
cannot bear it. Yes, I can. God’s
will is best. But I cannot understand.”</p>

<p>One Advent the last remaining
friend of her youth sent to her, begging
her to come with haste to pass
with her the last Christmas they
could expect to be together on
earth; and the brave old woman,
though craving to spend the holy
season near her darlings’ graves,
went forth to face the inclement
weather with as stout a heart as in
her youth she had sped along Exeter
Beach under the threatening
sky. In a little village, with no one
near who knew her except her servants,
Death laid his hand upon her
who had desired him for many
days.</p>

<p>“This is a serious illness,” the
physician said to her. Then, reading
rightly the spirit with which he
had to deal, he added: “A sickness
unto death, madam.”</p>

<p>“Harness the horses, then,” she
said, lifting herself, “and let me
get to Ewemouth and die there.”</p>

<p>“Send for a priest,” the doctor
answered her. “You have no time
to lose.”</p>

<p>“It has been always so, father,”
Jane said, looking up pitifully into
the face of the priest when at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
he came. “From the time that I
first earnestly gave myself to God,
up to this time, he has thwarted
me in every way. Sixty years ago
this very Christmas Eve he did it.
It all comes back to me as hard to
bear as then; and all my life has
been like that.” And slowly and
with pauses Jane told the story of
her night at Lonely Cove.</p>

<p>“It has always been so, father.
Whenever I have loved any one
or tried to help any one, I have
failed or they have left me.”</p>

<p>“My daughter,” the priest replied,
“God’s work in a life like yours
is far more the subjection of the
will than the number of holy actions
for others. Be sure that what we
think failure is often success in God’s
eyes and through his power. He
asks one last sacrifice from you.
Madam, God has brought you here
to add the crowning blessing to
your life&mdash;the opportunity of a last
and entire surrender of your will
to his most blessed will. Will you
offer to him your whole life, that to
you seems so incomplete and marred,
judged by your own plans and
wishes, saying to him without reserve
that you believe, certainly, that
his way is far better than yours?”</p>

<p>He held the crucifix before her,
and suddenly the long years seemed
to vanish like a dream, and she
felt once more the biting cold in
the haunted house at Lonely Cove,
and again a child nestled upon her
heart, bringing with it the thought
of the manger-bed, and the question,
<em>Why</em> should so much suffering
be? And from that manger her
thoughts returned to the hard couch
of the cross; and to all that mystery
of suffering came the mysterious
answer, “Not my will, but
thine, be done.”</p>

<p>She took and kissed the offered
crucifix. “Yes, father,” she said
meekly. “May the most just, most
high, and most amiable will of God
be done, praised, and eternally exalted
in all things. I had rather
die here, O my God! since it is thy
blessed will, than in any other place
on earth.”</p>

<p>“Amen,” said the priest.</p>

<p>But when the last sacraments had
been administered, and Jane lay
calm and patient now, waiting her
release, the priest drew near to her,
and looked with a great reverence
upon her face.</p>

<p>“My daughter,” he said “it is at
times the will of God to show us
even here the use of some part at
least of what he has let us do for
him. Be sure his Sacred Heart remembers
all the rest as well. Sixty
years ago this Christmas Eve my
father was saved from a great sin,
my mother and I from death, by a
Christian woman’s love for her Lord.
The first confession I ever heard
was my own father’s last. He told
me that from the time he saw that
rich young girl in rags endure the
biting cold for God, faith lived in
his heart, and <em>would not die</em>. I saw
him pass away from earth in penitence
and hope. For more than
thirty years I have labored among
God’s poor as your thank-offering.
Madam, my mother by the love of
God, God sends you this token that
he has worked his own work by
means of you all your life long.
He sends you this token, because
you have given him the thing he
most desired of you&mdash;your will.”</p>

<p>Jane folded her aged hands humbly.
“Not unto us, O Lord!” she
said, low and faint, and then a voice
as of a son and priest at once spoke
clearly, seeing her time had come:
“Depart, O Christian soul! in
peace.”</p>

<h3>THE APOSTOLIC MISSION TO CHILI.<br />
<i>A CHAPTER IN THE LIFE OF PIUS IX.</i></h3>

<p>Before entertaining ourselves
with an account of the voyage and
journeys, from Genoa to Buenos
Ayres and across the continent to
Valparaiso, of the first pope who has
ever been to America, we shall enter
into a few details to show the
occasion of the apostolic mission
which he accompanied in an official
capacity.</p>

<p>The great reverses of Spain at
the beginning of the present century,
and the consequent weakening
of the bonds that united her
American colonies to their mother-country,
besides some other causes
silently working since the emancipation
of the thirteen British provinces
from England, finally led to a
Declaration of Independence, which
was established after several years
of war. But the king to whose
government these New-World possessions
had been subject for nearly
three hundred years refused to recognize
the accomplished fact or
to enter into diplomatic relations
with rebels against his authority.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>The Congress of Verona, in 1822,
took some notice of these revolted
countries; but the European powers
did not all agree to receive
them into the family of nations by
a formal recognition, and it is well
known that the views expressed in
that assembly gave rise on the part
of the President of the United
States to a declaration of policy
which has been called the Monroe
Doctrine.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> The Holy See, having
sublimer interests to deal with,
could not act as indifferently in this
matter as other governments, which
looked only to temporal advantage,
and wrangled over old systems of
public policy regardless of recent
events. By the quixotic obstinacy
of Spain the South American republics
suffered much inconvenience,
particularly in point of religion,
because Rome could not
provide for their spiritual wants
without risking an open rupture
with his Catholic Majesty&mdash;such
were royal pretensions of restricting
the exercise of papal rights,
even in merely nominal dominions.<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>During the latter part of Pius
VII.’s pontificate the government
of Chili sent one of its distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
citizens, the Archdeacon Don José
Cienfuegos, envoy to Rome, with
instructions to try to establish
direct ecclesiastical relations between
the Holy See and Santiago,
the capital of his country. He arrived
there on August 22, 1822,
and was well received, but only in
his spiritual capacity. The pope
would not recognize him as a political
agent. On the 7th of September
following the Holy Father addressed
a brief to the Bishop of Merida
de Maracaybo, in which he expressed
himself solicitous for the spiritual
necessities of his children in
those far-distant parts of America,
and intimated his ardent desire to
relieve them. A little later he
formed a special congregation of
six cardinals, presided over by Della
Genga, who became his successor
as Leo XII.; and after mature
deliberation on the religious affairs
in the ex-viceroyalties of Spain, it
was determined to send a mission
to Chili, that country being chosen
for the honor as having made the
first advances. This measure so
displeased the Spanish government
that the nuncio Monsignor&mdash;afterwards
Cardinal&mdash;Giustiniani was
dismissed; and although he was
soon after permitted to return, the
wound inflicted upon him left its
sting behind, for, coming very near
to the number of votes requisite to
election in the conclave after Pius
VIII.’s death, the court of Madrid
barred his fortune by the exercise
of that odious privilege called
the <i lang="es">Esclusiva</i>; the ground of his
exclusion from the Papacy being
supposed at Rome to have been
his participation in the appointment
of bishops to South America.
The right (?) of veto expires with
its exercise once in each conclave;
and Cardinal Cappellari (Gregory
XVI.), who, as we shall see, had the
most to do with these episcopal
nominations, was elected pope.</p>

<p>The choice of a vicar-apostolic
for the Chilian mission fell upon
Prof. Ostini (later nuncio to Brazil
and a cardinal), who, after having
accepted the position, saw fit
suddenly to decline it for reasons
best known to himself. In his
stead Don Giovanni Muzi, then attached
to the nunciature at Vienna,
was selected, and, having been recalled
to Rome, was consecrated
Archbishop of Philippi in <i lang="la">partibus
infidelium</i>,<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> with orders to proceed
immediately to Santiago. The mission,
of which we shall speak more
particularly hereafter, embarked
on October 4, 1823, and reached
Rome on its return the 7th of
July, 1825.</p>

<p>Leo XII. succeeded Pius VII.
In 1824 the republic of Colombia
sent Don Ignacio Texada to Rome
with an application for bishops and
apostolic vicars in that immense
region; but the Spanish ambassador,
Chevalier Vargas, a haughty
diplomate, brimful of <i lang="es">Españolismo</i>,
went to the pope and demanded
his dismissal. This was refused.
The envoy had come for spiritual
interests, not on political grounds;
and the Spaniard could not convince
Leo that the rebel’s argument&mdash;by
which he asked no more than
that species of indirect recognition
granted by the Holy See, under Innocent
X. and Alexander VII., to
the house of Braganza when it forced
Portugal from under Spanish
rule&mdash;was not a good one and
founded on precedent. Nevertheless,
Texada returned to Bologna,
and finally withdrew altogether
from the Papal States. He had
some fine qualities, but lacked discretion
in speech, which was a fault<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
very injurious to his position.
Harpocrates is still the great god
of diplomacy the world over. This
state of things was embarrassing.
Spain had refused to recognize the
independence of her many provinces
in the New World, although she
had ceased practically even to disturb
them. The king, who was
somewhat of a <em>Marquis de Carabas</em>,
claimed all his old rights over
them, and, among them, that of
episcopal presentation. Cardinal
Wiseman, who was an attentive observer
of these times, remarks&mdash;very
properly, we think&mdash;that even if
such a power could be still called
legal, “it would have been quite
unreasonable to expect that the
free republics would acknowledge
the jurisdiction of the country
which declared itself at war with
them.” This was a clear case in
which allegiance should follow protection.
After a prudent delay,
Leo thought it his duty to represent
energetically to the Spanish
government the inconvenience he
suffered from the existing state of
affairs, and the impossibility of his
viewing with indifference a condition
in which the faithful, long deprived
of pastors, were urgently
asking for bishops for the vacant
sees. Yet His Holiness had taken
no decisive step, but called upon
his majesty either to reduce his
transatlantic subjects to obedience
or to leave him free to provide as
best he could for the necessities of
the church. In the consistory of
May 21, 1827, the pope, after protesting
that he could not any longer
in conscience delay his duty
to Spanish America, proceeded to
nominate bishops for more than
six dioceses in those parts. Madrid
was, of course, displeased, although
it was twelve years since the government
had lost even the shadow
of authority there, and at first refused
to receive the new nuncio,
Tiberi.<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> At this juncture Pedro
Gomez de Labrador was sent from
Spain expressly to defeat the measure;
but although “acknowledged
by all parties, and especially by the
diplomatic body in Rome, to be
one of the most able and accomplished
statesmen in Europe, yet
he could not carry his point”
against the quiet and monk-like
Cardinal Cappellari, who was deputed
by the pope to meet him. In
the allocution pronounced by Labbrador
before the Sacred College,
assembled in conclave to elect a
successor to Leo, he made an allusion
to the ever-recurring subject
of the revolted Americans; but
although done with tact, it grated
on the ears of many as too persistently
and, under the circumstances,
unreasonably put forward.</p>

<p>The discussion between the courts
of Rome and Madrid was not renewed
during the brief pontificate of
Pius VIII.; but in the encyclical
letter announcing his election there
is a delicate reference to the affair
which, although not expressly
named, will be perceived by those
who are acquainted with the questions
of that day. Comte de Maistre
says somewhere that if a parish be
left without a priest for thirty years,
the people will worship&mdash;the pigs;
and although the absence of a bishop
from his diocese for such a
length of time might not induce a
similar result, yet the faithful would
drop, perhaps, into a Presbyterian
form of church government and be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
lost. The veteran statesman Cardinal
Consalvi evidently thought so,
as we see by the fourth point, which
treats of Spanish America, in the
conference that he was invited to
hold with Leo XII. on the most
important interests of the Holy
See.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> When, therefore, Gregory
XVI.&mdash;who, as Cardinal Cappellari;
had not been a stranger to the long
dispute&mdash;became pope, he ended
the matter promptly and for ever.
In his first consistory, held in February,
1831, he filled a number of
vacant sees and erected new ones
where required in South America.
On the 31st of August following he
published the apostolic constitution
“Solicitudo Ecclesiarum,” in which
he explained the reasons why the
Holy See, in order to be able to
govern the universal church, whose
interests are paramount to all local
disputes, recognizes <i lang="la">de facto</i> governments,
without intending by this
to confer a new right, detract from
any legitimate claim, or decide upon
<i lang="la">de jure</i> questions. The republics
of New Granada<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> (1835), Ecuador
(1838), and Chili (1840) were subsequently
recognized with all the
solemnities of international law.</p>

<p>In the last-named country there
were two episcopal sees during the
Spanish dominion. These were
Santiago and Concepcion, both subject
to the Metropolitan of Lima;
but Gregory rearranged the Chilian
episcopate, making the first see an
archbishopric, with Concepcion, La
Serena, and San Carlos de Ancud
(in the island of Chiloe) for suffragan
sees.</p>

<p>At the time that the apostolic
mission to South America was determined
upon, there was living in
Rome a young ecclesiastic as yet “to
fortune and to fame unknown,” but
who was destined to become the
first pope who has ever been across
the Atlantic, and the foremost man
of the XIXth century. This was
Don Giovanni Mastai-Ferretti, one
of the fourteen canons of the collegiate
church of Santa Maria <i lang="it">in Via
Lata</i>. He was selected by Pius VII.
to accompany Mgr. Muzi as adjunct.
The secretary of the apostolic
delegation was a priest named
Giuseppe Sallusti, who wrote a full
narrative of the expedition, in
which, as Cardinal Wiseman says,
“The minutest details are related
with the good-humored garrulity of
a new traveller, who to habits of
business and practical acquaintance
with graver matters unites, as is
common in the South, a dash of
comic humor and a keen sense of
the ridiculous, and withal a charming
simplicity and freshness of mind,
which render the book amusing as
well as instructive, in spite of its
heavy quotations from that lightest
of poets, Metastasio.”<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> It is in 4
vols. 8vo, with a map. Comparatively
only a small portion of the
work is taken up with the actual
voyages and travels of the party,
the rest being devoted to the
preliminaries or causes of the mission,
to a description of Chili, and
an account of the many missionary
establishments which had once
flourished, as well as of those that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
were still maintained, there. A
fifth volume was promised by the
author to contain the documents,
official acts, and results of the mission;
but we believe that it was
never published. The vicar-apostolic
having received, at the earnest
solicitation of a learned ecclesiastic
from the Argentine Confederation,
Rev. Dr. Pacheco, very ample faculties
not only for the country to
which he was more immediately accredited,
but also for Buenos Ayres,
Peru, Colombia, Mexico, and all
other parts of the ex-Spanish dominions,
and accompanied by the
envoy Cienfuegos and Father Raymond
Arce, a young Dominican
belonging to Santiago, the party
left Rome for Bologna, where it
rested awhile to get a foretaste of
the magnificent scenes in the New
World from Father T. de Molina,
who had long resided in Chili. The
next stage in the journey was to
Genoa, the port of embarkation,
which was reached only on the
17th of July; but, “by a series of
almost ludicrous delays,” the expedition
was detained until after the
death of Pius VII. and the election
of his successor, Leo XII., who confirmed
the mission and addressed a
brief to the president<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> of the Chilian
Republic, recommending its objects
and the welfare of its members.</p>

<p>All matters being now satisfactorily
arranged, the party got on
board the fine French-built brig
<i>Eloysa</i> on the 11th of October,
1823. The vessel sailed under
Sardinian colors, and was manned
by a crew of thirty-four men, and
officered by experienced sailors, the
captain, Anthony Copello, having
several times navigated the South
Atlantic. The weather was very
rough, as usual, in the Gulf of
Lyons; “and gurly grew the sea,”
to the dismay and discomfiture of
the terrified landsmen, “Mastai,” as
Sallusti familiarly calls his companion,
suffering horribly from sickness.
This was but the beginning of many
trials, and even some serious dangers,
amidst which we can well
imagine that the captain would have
been glad beyond measure if any
one had hinted at the very special
Providence that guarded his ship,
by quoting the famous words, “<i lang="la">Quid
times? Cæsarem vehis et fortunam
ejus!</i>” Soon the <i>Eloysa</i> approached
the coast of Catalonia, down which
she sailed at the rate of ten knots
an hour, until struck by a furious
southwest hurricane, the <i lang="it">libeccio</i> so
much dreaded in the Mediterranean,
which threatened destruction to all
and everything in its course. To a
landsman like Sallusti the storms
encountered on this voyage would
naturally appear worse than they
really were, and his frequent account
of “waves mountain-high”
and “imminent shipwreck” would
perhaps sound like “yarns” to an
old tar. He delights in describing
the <i>Eloysa</i> as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Uplifted on the surge, to heaven she flies,</div>
<div class="verse">Her shattered top half buried in the skies”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse right">&mdash;(<cite>Falconer</cite>),</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and everywhere shows himself, like
a good inland <i lang="it">abbate</i>, dreadfully
afraid of salt water. Capt. Copello
would fain have put into Valencia
for shelter; but it was feared that
the Spanish authorities might detain
his ship, or at least disembark
the passengers, and it was determined
rather to brave the elements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
than to trust themselves within gunshot
of a Spanish harbor. These
bold resolutions, however, did not
appease the fury of the wind, and it
finally came to deciding between a
watery grave and a stony prison;
the decision was quickly taken, and
Palma, in the island of Majorca,
was fetched in safety. The mission
party was very inhospitably treated
here; and Mgr. Muzi and Canon
Mastai were ordered to come on
shore at once and give an account
of themselves. As soon as they
had put foot on land, the two distinguished
ecclesiastics were thrust
into a cold and filthy Lazaretto, on
plea of sanitary regulations, but
really out of spite for their character
and destination. Their papers
were seized, and measures instantly
taken to bring them to trial; and
there was even talk of sending them
to an African fortress where political
prisoners were confined. When
Sallusti heard of this Balearic treatment,
he summoned all his Italian
courage, and, going on shore, declared
to the cocked-hatted officials
that he would share the fate of his
companions; but instead of admiring
this prodigality of a great soul
(Hor. <cite>Od.</cite> i. 12, 38), those unclassical
islanders simply swore round
oaths and turned him in with the
rest. This was fortunate in one
sense; for we would otherwise have
missed a good description of the
examination of the three Italians
before the magistrates, who behaved
rudely; the alcade, in his quality
of judge, putting on more airs than
a Roman proconsul.<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> Further
outrages were threatened, but the
intervention of the <em>Sardinian consul</em>
and of the Bishop of Palma finally
convinced those proud men of the
exclusively religious mission of
their victims. In view of subsequent
events in Italy, it seems
strange that the future pope should
have been saved from further indignities,
and perhaps from a dungeon,
by an agent of the Piedmontese
government; yet so it was.
The Italians were permitted to return
to the ship, but a demand was
made to deliver up the two Chilians
as rebellious Spanish subjects.
This was promptly refused; but
notwithstanding a great deal of
blustering and many threats, the
case was allowed to drop, and the
<i>Eloysa</i> sailed away after several
days’ detention. Gibraltar was passed
on the 28th of October, and a
severe storm having tossed the
brig about unmercifully on her
entry into the Atlantic, the peak
of Teneriffe loomed up on November
4.</p>

<p>After leaving the Canary Islands,
the <i>Eloysa</i> was hailed one dark
night by a shot across her bows,
which came from a Colombian privateer,
and quickly brought her to.
She was quickly boarded, and a
gruff voice demanded her papers
and to have the crew and passengers
mustered on deck. Sallusti
was in mortal dread, and, to judge
from his description of the scene,
he must have been quaking with
fear; but Don Giovanni Mastai behaved
with that calmness and dignity
which even then began to be
remarked in him, in whatever circumstances
he found himself. After
some delay, the brig was allowed
to proceed; nothing being
taken off but a bottle of good Malaga
wine&mdash;which, however, was rather
<em>accepted</em> than stolen by the
rover of the seas.</p>

<p>After a time the Cape Verd Islands
appeared in all their richness;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
and on the 27th of the month the
line was crossed amidst the usual
riot of sailors, and with the payment
of a generous ransom by the
clergy. On December 8 the <i>Eloysa</i>
lay becalmed alongside of a slaver
crowded with poor Africans
on their way to Brazil. Sallusti
complains about this time of bad
water and short rations, and mentions
with particular disgust that
the fare generally consisted of potatoes
and lean chickens. On the
22d a man fell overboard in a dreadful
gale, and was rescued with difficulty.
Christmas was celebrated
as well as circumstances permitted;
and a neat little oratory having
been fitted up in the main cabin,
midnight Mass was said by the
archbishop, the second Mass by
Canon Mastai, and the third by
Friar Arce. On the 27th of December,
S. John’s Day, and the patronal
feast of the canon, the welcome
cry of “Land ho!” was heard
from the look-out at the mast-head
about three <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>, and the crew and
passengers united upon deck to return
fervent thanks to Almighty
God. The land sighted was a small
desert island, a little north of Cape
Santa Maria, off the coast of Uruguay.
A fearful storm was encountered
the next evening at the mouth
of the La Plata. This was one of
those southwestern gales, called
<i lang="es">Pamperos</i>, which frequently blow
with inconceivable fury, causing singular
fluctuations in the depth of
the wide mouth of the river. It raged
so that the captain was obliged to
cut his cable and abandon the shelter
of Flores Island, which he had
sought when it began, and to take
to the open sea again. With better
weather he returned and dropped
anchor opposite Montevideo on the
evening of January 1, 1824. Sallusti
goes into raptures over the
beautiful aspect of the city, as seen
from the bay; its broad and regular
streets, its stately houses built on a
gentle elevation, its fine cathedral,
the strains of music borne over the
water&mdash;everything enchanted the
travellers, weary of a three months’
voyage.</p>

<p>As soon as the news got abroad
of a delegation from the pope, the
whole city was in a joyful commotion,
and a deputation, consisting
of the cathedral chapter, four other
secular priests, and two Dominican
fathers, came to the ship to pay their
respects to Mgr. Muzi, who was also
invited on shore and pressed with
every offer of assistance by the most
honorable representatives of the
laity. These kind attentions could
not induce the party to land; and as
soon as damages were repaired and
a pilot received, sail was made for
Buenos Ayres, which was sighted at
two <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span> of January 5; but just
while the passengers were all on
deck watching the approaches to
the city, they were assailed and
driven below by myriads of mosquitoes.
Sallusti is very vehement
against these sharp little insects, and
bewails the lot of those who must
live among them; but he carefully
avoids a comparison with the <em>fleas</em>
of his native Italy. Although the
passengers remained on board that
night, crowds of people lined the
shore, and, after salutes of artillery,
greeted them with cries of “Long
live the vicar apostolic!” “Cheers
for America!” “Success to Chili!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
On the following day the captain of
the port and his suite came off to
the brig, bringing a courteous note
from the governor, offering a public
reception (for which preparations
had already been made) and the hospitalities
of the city to the members
of the mission. This was declined,
for reasons that are not very clear;
but although the archbishop gave
his bad health as the principal excuse,
we suspect that Cienfuegos
impressed upon the Italians that,
the mission being directed to <em>his</em>
country, it were uncourtly to parade
it before reaching its destination.
By their minds such a view would
be accepted as <i lang="it">assai diplomatico</i>.
When the party did land, they put
up at a hotel called “The Three
Kings,” kept by a jolly Englishman,
who treated them right royally&mdash;and
made them pay in proportion.
During their twelve days’ stay in
Buenos Ayres, the archbishop and
his suite received every mark of
reverence from the people; yet the
officials maintained a cold reserve
since the refusal to accept their invitation.
Even the ecclesiastical
authority&mdash;such as it was&mdash;put on
very bad airs; Zavaletta, a simple
priest, but administrator of the diocese,
having the audacity to withdraw
from Mgr. Muzi permission,
which had been previously granted
to give confirmation. At the time
of the arrival of the apostolic mission
the provinces of the Rio de
la Plata, which had formed part of
the Spanish viceroyalty of Buenos
Ayres, had been united from 1816
to 1820, but were now in a state of political
isolation, somewhat like that
of the States of the American Union
before the federal Constitution was
adopted. Soon after the arrival of
the mission, another General Congress
was called. Still, the Italians
were not impressed&mdash;as it was important
that they should be to obtain
proper consideration at Rome,&mdash;with
the idea of a strong government
holding sway over a vast and
wealthy territory. On the 16th of
January, at nine o’clock in the forenoon,
the party began the journey
across the continent. Three great
covered wagons, each drawn by four
horses and guided by twelve postilions,
composed the train; while a
courier went ahead to hunt up quarters,
and a mounted orderly, with
a very long sword and a fierce-looking
beard, brought up the rear or
pranced about the flanks of the
line. The drivers kept around in
no particular order, sonorously
cracking their whips and uttering
loud sounds which probably were
not oaths to the unaccustomed ears
of Sallusti. Besides the three Italians,
there was Cienfuegos with four
young Chilians in his company and
two servants, so that the whole
party was pretty numerous, and the
more so when, a little further on, six
gallant guachos were added as an
escort. Only fifteen miles were
made the first day, which brought
the party to Moron, where confirmation
was given. At a miserable
rancho called Lujan the archbishop
said his first Mass on the pampas at
a rich altar improvised for him by
the <i lang="es">padre</i> of the place, and surmounted
by four massive silver candlesticks.
The room was hung
round with rich damask hangings.
It was like a jewel in a dung-heap.
The Arecife stream was crossed in
boats by the travellers, but forded by
the wagons and horsemen. The superb
Parana River was reached at
San Pedro; and thence the route lay
through a rich and beautiful country
to the important town of Rosario,
on the high, precipitous banks of
the great river. At the outskirts of
this place the party was met by the
parish priest; and confirmation was
administered the next day to an immense
number of the faithful, long
deprived of this sacrament. From
Rosario, which they left on the
morning of the 23d, the journey
was long, weary, and dangerous, on
account of the roving bands of Indians
which at that period scoured
the plains in all directions to cut
off herdsmen and small parties of
travellers or traders, making a booty
of their baggage, killing the men,
and carrying women and children
into captivity. At a little station
called Orqueta the party caught
sight for the first time of a wild Indian,
who was lurking about the
place in a very suspicious manner,
but kept at a respectful distance
from the guachos. When Sallusti
saw this man apparently spying out
the route and strength of the party,
the marrow nearly froze in his
bones; and he certainly had good
cause for alarm. It happened that
leaving Buenos Ayres a few days
earlier than had been given out was
lucky; for a large band of these
mounted savages, armed with lances
and lassos, had got wind of the arrival
of great personages from Europe,
carrying (it was reported) an
immense amount of treasure to the
Pacific coast, and had formed a plan
to attack them, which was defeated
only by mistaking the day of their
departure, whereby their arrival at
the lonely and ill-famed post of Desmochados
was miscalculated. Three
days after the mission party had
passed, the Indians, to the number
of about three hundred, swooped
down upon the place, but, instead of
finding the rich foreigners, they surrounded
only a miserable set of
twenty peons escorting a lot of goods
across the plains. These were all
massacred except one, who, although
badly wounded and left for dead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
survived to tell the story and
describe the fiendish disappointment
of the savages at not capturing
the prey they expected. At Frayle
Muerto Mgr. Muzi received, through
the agency of Cienfuegos, a polite
message from the clergy of Cordova;<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
but having sent his return compliments
directly instead of through
the channel of original communication,
the Chilian thought himself
slighted, and separated from the mission
party, preceding it a good distance,
and taking with him, besides
his own attendants, the orderly in
brilliant uniform, who, the Europeans
had the mortification of seeing,
was meant to distinguish the <em>native</em>,
although a subordinate in clerical
rank. Such is human nature,
whether at courts or on a dusty
plain.</p>

<p>After passing through several
small settlements and the more important
town of San Luis&mdash;being
everywhere well received&mdash;the fine
old city of Mendoza was reached
on the 15th of February. It seemed
as if the entire population had
turned out to honor the distinguished
arrivals. Triumphal arches were
erected, troops were drawn up
under arms, processions of citizens
and clergy marshalled; from every
house richly-colored tapestry was
suspended, while the balconies were
filled with ladies, who threw down
flowers in the path of the apostolic
vicar as he entered the town and
proceeded to the house of a noble
and wealthy lady, Doña Emmanuela
Corbalan, in which everything had
been prepared on the grandest scale
of provincial magnificence, and
where Cienfuegos, in all his glory and
recovered temper, was waiting to receive
him and Canon (Count) Mastai,
who were to be lodged there
during their stay; the secretary, Sallusti,
being handed over to a less worshipful
host. Religious and civic
festivals, excursions in the environs
to the vineyards, gardens,
farms, and silver-mines, with other
congenial occupations, detained
the party very agreeably during
nine days in this neat and pleasant
town, the climate of which is noted
for its salubrity. On the 24th they
left Mendoza, and had a delightful
trip on horseback over good roads
and through a civilized country
for seventy-five miles to the foot of
the mighty Andes. They were now
on the eastern range of the Cordilleras,
at the Paramilla Mountains,
which are about ten thousand feet
high and partly covered with wood.
Between these and the western range
they traversed, near thirty-two degrees
south latitude, a wide valley,
sterile and impregnated with salt, for
over forty miles, called the Uspallata.
For fifteen miles the road was level,
and the remainder winding up and
down the hills which skirt both
ranges. After crossing this valley,
they struck the great range of the
Andes, which is between fifty and
sixty miles in width, consisting of
four or five parallel masses of rock,
divided from one another by deep
and dangerous ravines and sombre
glens. The road which leads over
them is called the <i lang="es">Cumbre</i> (summit)
Pass, and attains an elevation of
twelve thousand four hundred and
fifty-four feet above the level of the
sea. Our travellers crossed on
mules by this road, getting to the
north of them, amidst piles of perpetual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
snow, a magnificent view of
the grand volcano of Aconcagua,
which is nearly twenty-four thousand
feet high. The passage of
the mountains was grand and impressive,
but was not made without
danger to the lives of some of the
party, particularly on the 29th of
February. From La Cumbre there
is a gradual descent to the city of
Santiago. On the 1st of March
the travellers cast their admiring
gaze upon the Pacific slope, which,
from that day until they entered the
capital of Chili, on the 6th of the
month&mdash;passing through Villa-de-Santa-Rosa
and over the magnificent
plains of Chacabuco&mdash;was a continually
shifting panorama of natural
beauty, enhanced by villages, convents,
and churches perched on the
side of verdant hills or nestling in the
fruitful valleys. At every halting-place
their hearts were filled with a
holy joy to witness the demonstrations
of faith among the people, and
of loyalty to their great spiritual
chief on earth, represented by Mgr.
Muzi. The party entered Santiago,
as was said, on the 6th, and, going
to the cathedral, the archbishop intoned
pontifically the <cite>Te Deum</cite>,
with the assistance of a future pope
and of the historian of the apostolic
mission. The members of the legation
were lodged in a house near
the <i lang="es">Cappucinas</i>; and although we
know little of the occupations of
Canon Mastai in Chili, it is certain
that he made himself personally
very agreeable. How could
it be otherwise?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“A man of letters, and of manners too:</div>
<div class="verse">Of manners sweet as virtue always wears,</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse right">&mdash;(<cite>Cowper.</cite>)</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We have been told by a distinguished
Chilian that Canonico Mastai
was a frequent guest in Santiago
at the house of his uncle, Don Francisco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
Ruiz Tagle, and used to go
out with him quite often to his
country-seat. Although the mission
was received with an almost universal
outburst of enthusiasm, and
notwithstanding the majority of the
clergy and people was well disposed,
it met with considerable opposition
from a fierce and fanatical party of
Freemasons, which threw every obstacle
in the way of close relations
with Rome. Cardinal Wiseman
says, in the article in the <cite>Dublin
Review</cite> from which we have already
quoted, that “there was jealousy
and bad faith on the part of the
Chilian government, and want of
tact and bad management, we fear
on the part of the head of the mission.”
Unfortunately, the government
was in a transition state between
the presidency of O’Higgins
and the election of his successor,
Freire, and administered by a <i lang="es">Junta</i>.
Where there were so many voices
there was much confusion. Cienfuegos,
however, seems to have
done his duty, and he was rewarded
in 1832 by the bishopric of Concepcion,
which had been vacant for
fourteen years. He died in 1839.
With regard to the causes of the
failure of the mission, we will not
conceal what we have heard from an
excellent senator of Chili, although
we mention it reservedly&mdash;that one,
at least, of the reasons was a suspicion
that Muzi intended to put Italians
in the sees vacant or to be
erected in Chili.</p>

<p>From Santiago Mgr. Muzi and
his party went to Valparaiso, and
embarked for their return voyage
on the 30th of October, 1824.
The remarks of the celebrated
Spaniard Balmes upon the visit of
the future pope to the New World
find their place here: “There is
certainly in nature’s grand scenes
an influence which expands and
nerves the soul; and when these
are united to the contemplation of
different races, varied in civilization
and manners, the mind acquires a
largeness of sentiment most favorable
to the development of the understanding
and the heart, widening
the sphere of thought and ennobling
the affections. On this account
it is pleasing, above all things,
to see the youthful missionary, destined
to occupy the chair of S.
Peter, traverse the vast ocean; admire
the magnificent rivers and
superb chains of mountains in
America; travel through those forests
and plains where a rich and
fertile soil, left to itself, displays
with ostentatious luxury its inborn
treasures by the abundance, variety,
and beauty of its productions, animate
and inanimate; run risks
among savages, sleep in wretched
hovels or on the open plain, and
pass the night beneath that brilliant
canopy which astonishes the traveller
in the southern hemisphere.
Providence, which destined the
young Mastai-Ferretti to reign
over a people and to govern the
universal church, led him by the
hand to visit various nations, and
to contemplate the marvels of
nature.”<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>A remote but very providential
consequence of the visit of Pius IX.
to America, during his early career,
was the establishment of the South
American College at Rome, called
officially in Italian the Pio-Latino
Americano,<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> which educates aspirants
to the priesthood from Brazil
and all parts of the American continent
where the Spanish language
is spoken. A wealthy, intelligent,
and influential Chilian priest, Don<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
Ignacio Eyzaguirre,<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> who had been
vice-president of the House of Representatives
in 1848, and was an
author of repute, was charged by
Pius IX. in 1856 to visit the dioceses
of South and Central America
and Mexico, to obtain the views of
the several bishops upon the necessity
of founding an ecclesiastical
seminary at Rome. The project
was universally acceptable, and
funds having been provided&mdash;the
Holy Father giving liberally from his
private purse&mdash;a beginning was
made in 1858, when a part of the
Theatine Convent of San Andrea
<i lang="it">della Valle</i> was given up to the students,
who were put under the direction
of Jesuit Fathers. This
location was only temporary; and
the college was soon transferred to
the large house of the general of
the Dominicans, attached to the
convent of Santa Maria <i lang="it">sopra Minerva</i>,
and facing the piazza. However,
it has been moved again, and
in 1869 occupied the right wing of
the novitiate at San Andrea on the
Quirinal, with fifty-five inmates.
As if this worthy establishment had
to figure in its shifting fortune the
unsettled state of so many of the
Spanish American countries, it has
again been disturbed; yet to suffer
at the hands of Victor Emanuel
and his sacrilegious band is the
indication of a good cause, and will
prepare to meet other, although
hardly worse, enemies in the New
World.</p>

<h3>NELLIE’S DREAM ON CHRISTMAS EVE.</h3>

<p>They had quarrelled, these two&mdash;it
matters not about what trifle&mdash;till
the hot, bitter words seemed to
have formed an impassable barrier
and a silence fell between them that
the lowering brow and compressed
lip told would not be easily broken.
Both had loving hearts, and
treasured each other above all
earthly things. They had real sorrows
enough to make imaginary
ones glance off lightly; for the
second Christmas had not yet cast
its snows on their mother’s grave.
The thought of each was, “Had
<em>she</em> been here, this would not have
happened”; but pride was strong,
and the relenting thoughts were
hidden behind a cold exterior.</p>

<p>It was the week before Christmas,
and Laura, the eldest, was
assisting to trim the village church,
and in the Holy Presence the dark
thought faded and tender memories
seemed to reassert their olden
sway; and on returning from her
occupation she formed the resolution
to stop this folly, and make
advances towards assuming the old,
happy life.</p>

<p>“Father Black asked after you,
Nell,” she said, as she laid aside
her wrappings, and turned cheerily
to the fire. “He wants you to
play during the rehearsal of the
new Benediction to-morrow; for
Prof. C&mdash;&mdash; will be away.” But
she was met by a stony look and
closed lips. “Come, Nell,” she said
half impatiently, “don’t be so dignified;
why do you love that temper
of yours so dearly?”</p>

<p>“You said let there be silence
between us, and I am content,” was
the rejoinder. “I shall take care
not to trouble you in future.”</p>

<p>Pride and love struggled for mastery
in the heart of the eldest, and
it was a mingling of both that
brought the answer, in tones cold
enough to freeze the tenderness of
the words: “There will come a
silence between us one day, Nell,
you will be glad to break.” And
she passed from the room.</p>

<p>“Let it come,” was the almost
insolent reply; but there was a mist
in the flashing black eyes that contradicted
the words.</p>

<p>They passed the day apart from
each other, and at night, although
kneeling for prayer in the same
little oratory, and occupying the
same little white-draped chamber,
the chilling silence remained. So
passed the next day, and it was
now Christmas Eve. The evergreens
were all hung in the village
church; the altar was radiant
with flowers and tapers; the confessionals
were thronged; but both
sisters kept aloof, and both hearts
were aching over the pride and
anger that was strangling even religion
in their souls. Alas! alas!
how the angels must have mourned
to see days of such especial grace
passing in sin. Christmas gifts
had been prepared, but neither
would present them. How different
other Christmas Eves had
been!&mdash;the gentle mother overseeing
every preparation for the next
day, that was always celebrated as
a feast of joy. Those busy hands
were idle now, and the white snow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
was coldly drifting over the mound
that loving hearts would fain have
kept in perpetual summer. A
mother’s grave! Except to those
who have knelt beside that mound&mdash;that
seems such a slight barrier between
the aching heart and its
treasure, and yet is such a hopeless,
inexorable one&mdash;these words
have little meaning.</p>

<p>They retired early, and, as Nell
knelt for prayer, the hot tears rolled
through her fingers as she
thought of other Christmas mornings,
when they had been awakened
for early Mass by the “Merry
Christmas! girls,” that earth would
never, never hear again. But the
icy bands of pride that had frozen
around her heart would not melt,
and sleep came again in that stony
stillness.</p>

<p>Morning came to Nellie’s perturbed
visions, and in the gray
dawn “Merry Christmas” broke
forth from her lips; but the memory
of the past few days checked the
words, and they died in whispers.
But as she glanced at Laura, she
saw that her eyes were open, but
that their expression was fixed and
rigid. She sprang up with a vague
alarm, and laid her hand upon the
low, broad forehead. It was icy
cold. Shriek after shriek rang from
her lips, but they reached not the
death-dulled ear.</p>

<p>“I never meant it, Laura&mdash;I never
meant it! Only come back that I
may speak one word!” she moaned.
“O my God! give her back to me
for one hour, and I will submit to
thy will.” But her voice only broke
the silence, and the white, smiling
lips on the bed seemed a mockery
of the passionate anguish wailing
above them. She threw herself before
the little altar in her room.
“Blessed Mother!” she prayed,
“I promise, solemnly promise, that
never, never again will I give way
to the passionate temper that has
been my bane, if she may only come
back for one hour to grant forgiveness
for the awful words I have
spoken.” And for the first time
since she had realized her sorrow
tears fell from her eyes.</p>

<p>“Why, Nellie, Nellie, what ails
you?” said a familiar voice. “You
are crying in your sleep on this
merry Christmas morning; <em>do</em> waken.”
And, oh! the heaven that
met those unclosing eyes&mdash;Laura
bending over her, smiling, yet with
a look of doubt in her face as if the
icy barrier had not yet broken
down.</p>

<p>“O my darling, my darling!”
sobbed the excited girl, winding her
arms around her sister. “Thank
God it is only a dream; but never,
never again will I give way to my
awful temper. I have promised it,
Laura, and I will keep my vow.”</p>

<p>And she did. For though she
lived long enough for the dark hair
to lie like snowy floss under the
matron’s cap, never did those lips
utter stinging sarcasm or close in
sullen anger. And often, when
her gentle voice seemed unable to
stem some furious tide of passion
among her grandchildren, would
she tell the story of her dream on
Christmas Eve.</p>

<h3>ALLEGRI’S MISERERE.</h3>

<p>AT the base of a cliff flowed a
tiny rivulet; the rock caught the
rain-drops in his broad hand, and
poured them down in little streams
to meet their brothers at his feet,
while the brook murmured a constant
song of welcome. But a stone
broke from the cliff, and, falling
across the rivulet, threatened to cut
its tender thread of life.</p>

<p>“My little strength is useless,”
moaned the streamlet. “Vainly I
struggle to move onward; and below
the pebbles are waiting for
their cool bath, the budding flowers
are longing for my moisture, the
little fish are panting for their
breath. A thousand lives depend
on mine. Who will aid me? Who
will pity me?”</p>

<p>“Wait until Allegri passes; he
will pity you,” said the breeze.
“Once the cruel malaria seized me,
and bound messages of death upon
me. ‘Pity!’ I cried. ‘Free me from
this burden, from which I cannot
flee.’ ‘Hear the wind moan,’ said
some; but no one listened to my
prayer till I met a dreamy musician
with God’s own tenderness in his
deep eyes. ‘Have mercy!’ I sobbed;
and the gentle master plucked
branches of roses, and cast them to
me. I was covered with roses,
pierced with roses, filled with roses;
their redness entered my veins, and
their fragrance filled my breath;
roses fell upon my forehead with
the sweetness of a benediction.
The death I bore fled from me; for
nothing evil can exist in the presence
of heaven’s fragrance. Cry
to the good Allegri, little brooklet;
he will pity you.”</p>

<p>So the rivulet waited till the
master came, then sighed for mercy.
The rock was lifted, and the stream
flowed forward with a cry of joy to
share its happiness with pebble and
flower and fish.</p>

<p>A little bird had become entangled
in the meshes of a net. “Trust
to the good Allegri,” whispered the
breeze; “it is he who gave me liberty.”
“Trust to the good Allegri,”
rippled the brook; “it is he
who gave me liberty.” So the bird
waited till the master passed, then
begged a share of his universal
mercy. The meshes were parted,
and the bird flew to the morning
sky to tell its joy to the fading stars
and rising sun.</p>

<p>“Oh! yes, we all know Allegri,”
twinkled the stars. “Many a night
we have seen him at the bed of
sickness.”</p>

<p>“Many a day I have seen him in
the prison,” shouted the sun with
the splendor of a Gloria. “Wherever
are those that doubt, that mourn,
that suffer; wherever are those that
cry for help and mercy&mdash;there have
I found Allegri.”</p>

<p>The people of the earth wondered
what made the sun so glorious, not
knowing that he borrowed light
from the utterance of a good man’s
name.</p>

<p>A multitude of Rome’s children
had gathered in S. Peter’s. The
Pope was kneeling in the sanctuary;
princes and merchants were kneeling
together under the vast cupola,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
the poor were kneeling at the threshold;
even a leper dared to
kneel on the steps without, and
was allowed the presence of his
Lord. All souls were filled with
longing, all hearts were striving for
expression.</p>

<p>Then strains of music arose: O
soul! cease your longing; O heart!
cease your strife; now utterance is
found.</p>

<p>Sadder grew the tones, till, like the
dashing of waves, came the sigh:
“Vainly I struggle to move onward.
Have mercy, Father!” The lights
flickered and died, a shadow passed
over the worshippers, and the Tiber
without stopped in its course to
listen.</p>

<p>Sadder grew the tones, till the
moan was heard: “Vainly I strive to
escape these meshes. Have mercy,
Father!” The shadow grew deeper,
and a little bird without stopped in
its flight to listen.</p>

<p>Still was the music sadder with
the weight of the sob: “Vainly I flee
from this loathsome burden. Have
mercy, Father!” Vaster and darker
grew the shadow, and the very
breeze stopped in its course to listen.</p>

<p>And now the music mingled sigh
and moan and sob in one vast
despairing cry: “Vainly I struggle
against this rock of doubt. Have
mercy, Father! Vainly I strive to
escape these meshes of sin. Have
mercy, Father! Vainly I flee from
this evil self. Have mercy, O
Father! have mercy.” Darker and
deeper and vaster grew the shadow,
and all sin in those human hearts
stopped in its triumph to listen.</p>

<p>All light was dead, all sound was
dead. Was all hope dead? “No!”
wept a thousand eyes. “No!” sobbed
a thousand voices; for now high
above the altar shone forth the
promise of light in darkness, of
help in tribulation&mdash;in sight of
Pope and prince, in sight of rich
and poor, and even in sight of the
leper kneeling without, gleamed the
starry figure of the cross.</p>

<p>“How was this Mass of Allegri so
completely formed,” cry the three
centuries that have passed since
then, “that we have been able to

<p>The calm voice of nature answers:
It is because his own love
and mercy were universal; because
he had learned that all creation
needs the protecting watchfulness
of the Maker; because he gave even
the weakest creatures voice in his
all embracing cry of Miserere.</p>

<h3>THE YEAR OF OUR LORD 1875.</h3>

<p>The year 1875 has not been a specially
remarkable one as distinct from the years
immediately preceding it. Great questions,
which affect humanity at large beyond
the line of nationality, and which
were rife three or four years ago, are undecided
still. No wars, or revolutions, or
discoveries, or mighty changes have occurred
during the year to alter sensibly
the current of human affairs. What the
world at large quarrelled and wrangled
over a year, two years, three, four years
ago, it wrangles over still, and may for
years yet to come. Much as science and
culture have done to break down the
barriers that separate men and bring the
human family nearer together, nations,
nationally considered, stand as far apart
as ever they did, and the imaginary line
that divides neighboring peoples finds
them wide apart as the antipodes.</p>

<p>To begin a rapid and necessarily incomplete
review at home, the past year
can scarcely be regarded as either a
happy or successful one, commercially
speaking, in the United States. Preliminary
echoes of the Centennial year of
the great republic have been heard, but
amid them the crash of falling banks
that had no legitimate excuse for falling,
and of business firms that followed in
due order. This, however, is only a
repetition of the two preceding years,
which it is as painful as it would be useless
to dwell upon here. In a word,
business at large&mdash;instead of recovering,
as it was hoped it would, during the past
year&mdash;if anything, fell behind, and so continues.
The election did not tend to
enliven it. There are hopes, however, of
a real revival during the coming Centennial
year, or at least of a beginning on
the road of improvement. There is the
more reason to hope for this that large
branches of our industries, such as cereals,
iron, and cotton goods, are beginning
to find a good foreign market.</p>

<p>Looked at largely, there are some things
on which Americans may congratulate
themselves during the year. Chief
among these are their very misfortunes.
Extravagance in living, foolish
and vulgar display in dress and
equipage, have disappeared to a satisfactory
extent. Of course where wealth
abounds and fortunes are rolled up
easily, there will be shoddy; but then
let it be marked off, and the world will
not be the loser. Again, there was a
good sign on the part of the people to
form opinions of their own regarding the
questions up before them and the respective
merits and qualifications of the
various candidates for election. To be
sure, many, too many, persons were elected
who were a disgrace to their constituencies;
and while such men are set in
high and responsible positions it is vain
to look for reform in the thousand abuses
that afflict the conduct of public affairs.
Still, there was a hopeful indication of
the right feeling among the people.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most memorable, certainly
the most significant, event to Catholics
in the history of this country took place
during the year. The venerable Archbishop
of New York was raised by the
Holy Father to the dignity of the cardinalate,
and thereby set in the senate of
the church of which Christ is the invisible,
and the Pope, the successor of Peter,
the visible, head. To speak of the fitness
of the Holy Father’s choice in selecting
Archbishop McCloskey for this high
office and proud privilege of being the
first American cardinal is not for us.
It is sufficient to say that not Catholics
alone, but their Protestant fellow-countrymen
also, all the land over, received
the news and hailed the choice with acclaim.
But what moves us most is the
significance of the act. In the appointment
of an American cardinal in the
United States the wish expressed by the
Council of Trent has in this instance
been realized. That great council ordained,
respecting the subjects of the
cardinalate, that “the Most Holy Roman
Pontiff shall, as far as it can be conveniently
done, select (them) out of all the
nations of Christendom, as he shall find
persons suitable” (Sess. 24, <cite>De Ref.</cite>,
c. i.) Were this recommendation completely
carried out, it would probably be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
one of the greatest movements that have
taken place in the Catholic Church for
the last three centuries.</p>

<p>Suppose, for example, that the great
Catholic interests throughout the world
were represented in that body by men
of intelligence, of known virtue, and
large experience; suppose every nationality
had there its proportionate expression&mdash;a
senate thus composed would be
the most august assembly that ever was
brought together upon earth. It would
be the only world’s senate that the world
has ever witnessed. This would be giving
its proper expression to the note of
the universality of the church. The decisions
of the Holy Father on the world-interests
of the church, assisted by the
deliberations of such a body, would have
more power to sway the opinions and
actions of the world than armies of bayonets.
For, whatever may be said to the
contrary in favor of needle-guns and
rifled cannon, the force of public opinion
through such agents as electricity
and types moves the world, above
all when supported by the intelligence,
virtue, and experience of men who have
no other interests at heart than those of
God and the good of mankind.</p>

<p>Who knows but the time has come to
give this universality of the church a
fuller expression? Is not divine Providence
acting through modern discoveries,
rendering it possible for the human race
to be not only one family in blood, but
even in friendship and unity of purpose?
Perhaps the present persecutions of the
church in Italy are only relieving her
from past geographical and national
limitations, to place her more completely
in relations with the faithful throughout
the world. Who knows but the time is
near when the Holy Father will be surrounded
by representatives of all nations,
tribes, and peoples, from the South as
well as from the North, from the East as
well as from the West; by Italians,
Germans, Frenchmen, Spaniards, Englishmen,
Belgians, Portuguese, Austrians,
Irishmen, Americans, Canadians,
South Americans, Australians, as well
as by representatives of the faithful from
the empire of China? Would this new
departure be anything more than the
realization of the wish expressed by
that great and holy council held at
Trent three centuries ago?</p>

<p>In passing from our own to other lands,
we cannot do so, at the opening of
the second century of our country’s life,
without a glance at something larger
and wider than the mere local interests
of every-day life which touch us most
nearly. Beyond doubt there is much to
criticise, much, perhaps, to be ashamed
of, much to deplore, in the conduct
of our government, local and national,
and in the social state generally
of our people. Still, we see nothing at
present existing or threatening that is
beyond the remedy of the people itself.
It is a fashion among our pessimists to
contrast the America of to-day with the
America of a hundred years ago. Well,
we believe that we can stand the contrast.
The country has expanded and
developed, and promises so to continue
beyond all precedent in the history of
this world. When the experiment of a
century ago is contrasted with the established
fact&mdash;the nation&mdash;of a free and
prosperous people of to-day, we can only
bless God. And allowing the widest
margin for the evils and shortcomings in
our midst, when we glance across the
ocean at nations armed to the teeth,
looking upon one another as foes, and
either rending with internal throes or
threatening to be rent, pride in this
country deepens, and the heart swells
with gratitude that in these days God
has raised up a nation where all men
may possess their souls in peace.</p>

<p>We have some alarmists among us
who look in the near future to the occurrence
of scenes in this country similar
to those now being transacted in Europe,
where men are persecuted for conscience’
sake. We cannot share in these
alarms. As we see no evils in our
midst which are beyond the remedy of
the people, so we see no religious or
other questions that may arise which cannot
be civilly adjusted. This is not a
country where the raw head and bloody
bones thrive. The question of religion
is decided once for all in the Constitution.
Catholics, of course, have a large
heritage of misrepresentation to contend
against, but that is rapidly diminishing.
A Bismarck may strive to introduce into
our free country, through a band of
fanatics and weak-minded politicians,
the persecuting spirit which he has attempted
to introduce into England by a
Gladstone, which he has succeeded in
introducing into Italy by a Minghetti,
and into Switzerland by a Carteret; but
before they reach the hundredth part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
of the influence of the disgraceful
Know-Nothing party, the good sense
and true spirit of our countrymen will,
as it did in the case of that party,
brand all who have had any prominent
connection with the movement with the
note of infamy. The fanatical cry of
“No Popery” is evidently played out at
its fountain-source in old England, while
the attempt to revive its echoes will meet
with still less success in <em>new</em> England.
We see no clouds on the American
horizon that should cause Catholics any
grave apprehension.</p>

<p>The end of such attempts always is
that those who strike the sparks only
succeed in burning their fingers. All we
have to do is to walk straight along in
the path we have been following of common
citizenship with those around us,
in order to secure for ourselves all the
rights which we are ready to concede to
others.</p>

<p>The European situation during the
past year may be summed up under two
headings&mdash;the struggle between church
and state, and the prospects of war. To
enter at any length into the question between
church and state in Germany and
in other countries in Europe would be
going over old ground which has been
covered time and again in <span class="smcap">The Catholic
World</span>. Only such features of the
contest will be touched upon as may set
the present situation clearly before the
mind of the reader.</p>

<p>The official <cite>Provincial Correspondence</cite>, at
the opening of the past year, said in a retrospective
article on the events of 1874:
“The conviction has been forced upon
the German government that the German
ultramontane party are a revolutionary
party, directed by foreigners and
relying mainly upon the assistance of
foreign powers. The German government,
therefore, are under the necessity
of deprecating any encouragement of the
ultramontane party by foreign powers.
It was for this reason that the German
government last year thought it incumbent
on them to use plain language in
addressing the French government upon
the sayings and doings of some of the
French bishops. France had taken the
hint, and had prevented her ultramontanes
setting the world on fire merely to vent
their spite against Germany.… It was,
perhaps, to be expected under these circumstances
that, abandoning at last all
hope of foreign assistance, the German
ultramontanes would make their peace
with the government in Prussia, and no
longer object to laws they willingly obey
in Baden, Bavaria, Würtemberg, and
Oldenburg, not to speak of Austria and
other states. At all events, it was very
desirable that the ultramontanes should
yield before the church was thrown into
worse confusion by their malicious but
impotent resistance.”</p>

<p>Such was the pleasant prospect held
out for the Catholics by the official organ
at the opening of the year. The programme
sketched in it has been faithfully
carried out, and Germany has taken
another step in the path of freedom, internal
peace, and consolidation by planting
its foot nearer the throat of the
church. It is useless to enter into a refutation
of the falsehoods contained in
the extract from the official journal. They
have been refuted in the German Reichstag
and all the world over. It is needless,
also, to call attention to the tone of
the official journal, and the manner, become
a fashion of late with German
statesmen and writers at large, of warning
foreign powers to keep a civil tongue
in their heads respecting German matters,
or it may be the worse for them.
How far the Catholics have yielded to
the kindly invitation held out to them
the world has seen. We have before
this remarked on the strange anxiety
manifested by a government, convinced
of the justice of its cause and the means
it was pursuing towards its end, to stifle
the expression of public opinion, not
only at home, but abroad. Moreover, the
very fact of its being compelled to deprecate
“any encouragement of the ultramontane
party by foreign powers”
says as plainly as words can say it that
those powers see something in the party
to encourage.</p>

<p>Here is a sample&mdash;one out of hundreds
such&mdash;of the manner in which the members
of the “revolutionary party” have
been treated during the year, and of the
crimes, sympathy with which on the part
of foreign powers is so earnestly deprecated
by the German government. That
extremely active agent of Prince Bismarck,
the Prussian correspondent of
the London <cite>Times</cite>, tells the story of the
deposition of the Bishop of Paderborn by
the “Ecclesiastical” Court thus: “He
has been sentenced to-day (Jan. 6) to innumerable
fines, chiefly for appointing
clergymen without the consent of the secular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
authorities. [Is this a crime, reverend
and right reverend gentlemen of
the Protestant churches?] Never paying
any of these forfeits, he has been repeatedly
imprisoned and forcibly prevented
from exercising his functions. [And
now for the perversity of the man, the
“malicious but impotent resistance.”]
Notwithstanding the measures taken
against him, he has continued his opposition
to the state. He would not allow
his clerical training-schools to be visited
by government inspectors; he has declined
to reappoint a chaplain he had excommunicated
without the consent of the
government [What criminals SS. Peter
and Paul would be were they living in
Germany to-day!]; and he has continually
issued pastorals and made speeches
to deputations breathing the most hostile
sentiments against crown and parliament
[sentiments not quoted]. He
has received addresses covered with
more than one hundred thousand signatures,
and on a single day admitted twelve
thousand persons to his presence, who
had come to condole with him on the
martyr’s fate he was undergoing.” Let
it be borne in mind that this is not our
description, but that of an agent of the
Prussian government. Could words establish
more clearly the side on which
the criminality lies?</p>

<p>Only passing mention can be made of
events which have been already anticipated
and commented on. The extension
of the civil registration of births,
deaths, and marriages from Prussia to the
whole German Empire passed in January.
Perhaps no measure yet has so aroused
the indignation, not only of Catholics, but
of believing Protestants also. As the correspondent
already quoted tersely puts
the matter: “In all Germany this law
does away with the services of the clergy
in celebrating the three great domestic
events of life.” That is to say, there is
no longer need to baptize Christian children
in the name of God; there is no
longer need of God in the marriage service;
finally, as man comes into the
world, so he may go out of it, without the
name or the invocation of God, without
God’s blessing over his grave or the ceremonies
of religion attending the last act.
Like a dog he may come, like a dog he
may live, like a dog he may go. And
yet this is an evangelical power! Verily,
but of a strange evangel. The result of
it is shown already. Since the Prussian
Civil Registration Law was passed, only
twenty-five per cent. of all Berlin marriages
have been celebrated in churches,
while only thirty per cent. of the children
born in the capital have been baptized by
clergymen.</p>

<p>The passing of the Landsturm Bill converts
the whole German Empire into an
armed camp. “Henceforth every German
sound in wind and limb must be a soldier.
From the age of seventeen to forty-two,
every man not belonging to the army or
the reserve is to be liable to be called
out in the case of an actual or even a
threatened invasion,” says the London
<cite>Times</cite>. “At the word of command Germany
is arming <i lang="fr">en masse</i>, and the surrounding
nations&mdash;that is, the best part
of the world&mdash;cannot but do as she does.”
They are doing as she does, and all the
European powers to-day sleep beside
their arms. In face of this fact, what
comfort can men take from the meeting
and hobnobbing of the crowned heads
of Europe here, there, and everywhere,
or of their assurances of peace? Who
is strong enough to keep the peace, who
too weak to enkindle war? No man
and no people. It is this arming and incertitude
of one another that alone prevented
what locally was so insignificant
an affair as the outbreak within the year
of the Bosnian insurrection against Turkey
from lighting a universal conflagration.
The eagles of the great powers
gather around the Turkish carcase.
England seizes beforehand on the control
of the Suez Canal by way of preparing
for eventualities, and the Eastern
question begins at last to resolve itself
into this simple form: not, How shall
we uphold the empire? but, How shall
we divide the spoils?</p>

<p>The present rulers of Germany profess
to look upon their Catholic subjects as
the great foes of the German Empire.
The mistake is a fatal one; for in binding
the church they bind the only power that
can stop the dry-rot which is slowly eating
into the heart, not alone of Germany,
but of all nations to-day. That dry-rot
is socialism, the first-born of infidelity.
That socialism prevails in Germany the
rulers of that empire know, and its utterances
are as dreaded as an encyclical
of the Pope. Here are the elements of
socialism as pictured by the Cologne
<cite>Gazette</cite> at the opening of the year: “In
1874, although the great bubble schemes
burst in the summer of 1873, and although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
last year a plentiful harvest of
corn and wine came to our relief, the
consequences of the crisis are still felt.
Numerous undertakings are depreciated,
and even more lamentable than the losses
of the promoters are the mischievous
results of the sudden excessive rise in
wages, which could not possibly last, the
luxurious habits, the strikes, and all that
these involve on the laboring classes and
the whole industrial life of the German
nation. Habits of indolence and gluttony
have been established which it will
be hard to eradicate,” and much more in
the same strain.</p>

<p>This is only a straw showing which way
the wind blows. Persecution of the church
has not yet exhausted itself, though, beyond
the actual taking of life, it is hard
to see what remains to be done. The
final measure has been resorted to of
abrogating the articles of the Prussian
constitution of 1850, which were specially
drawn up to provide freedom of
religion and worship in their fullest
sense. Of the attitude of the German
Catholics, the prelates, the clergy, and
the laity, it is needless to speak. The
world has witnessed it; and the very
fierceness of the persecution simply
serves to show forth more gloriously the
divinity of the church; for no human
institution could live under it. One
result of the persecution has been the
return of a Catholic majority to the
Bavarian Parliament. We hope for the
unity of the German Empire, and its
true consolidation; but it is not in our
hearts to support tyranny, under whatever
name, least of all when it attacks
all that we hold most sacred. The German
policy must be totally altered before
it can command the sympathy of
freemen. It must be totally altered before
it can command the respect and full
allegiance of its subjects, so large and
important a section of whom are Catholics.
The Catholic majority in Bavaria
is but one sign of many of opposition to
the one-sided policy of which Prince
Bismarck is the author and expounder.
Who knows but that the threatened dissolution
of an empire erected on so false
and narrow a basis has not already begun
in Bavaria? All the sacrifices made
to establish the empire&mdash;not the least of
which were made by Bavaria&mdash;the German
chancellor, by his determined and
senseless religious persecution, would
now seem foolishly to ignore. And these
Bavarians, of all the Germans, once
aroused, and their religious rights infringed
upon, are not the men quietly
and meekly to subside under opposition.</p>

<p>We have dwelt more at length upon
Germany because it is the centre of the
strife that convulses, and threatens to
convulse, the world. Other topics must
consequently be hastily dismissed.</p>

<p>Of France there is nothing but good
to report. After a series of fiery debates
in the Assembly, the constitution of a
conservative republic was definitively
formed and agreed upon towards the end
of February. The nomination of councillors
of state was given to the President,
who resigned the nomination of the
senators. Of course France is still open
to surprises, and the various parties seem
as unable to coalesce as ever. But there
is no question that the government of
Marshal MacMahon has deserved well
of the country, and, could only a true republic
be established in France, it would
serve as a safe counter-check to the absolutisms
that threaten the east of Europe.
The commerce and industries of the
country have advanced even on the preceding
year, though the imports of 1874
amounted to 3,748,011,000 francs, and the
exports to 3,877,753,000 francs, these figures
being in excess of those of any former
years. The returns for the Paris savings-banks
in 1874 indicate how the poorer and
lower middle classes, who chiefly patronize
these establishments, are recovering
from the effects of the war and the Commune.
The deposits amounted to 14,500,000
francs, while in 1873 they were 13,500,000
francs, and in 1872 12,629,000
francs. There is every reason to believe
that the ratio of the past year will show
a corresponding increase.</p>

<p>While the tokens of reviving prosperity
are thus encouraging, those of a revival
of religious feeling and coming back to
the old ways and the old faith among the
people at large are not less so. A noble and
patriotic work is being accomplished
in the rapid formation and spread of Catholic
Working-men’s Clubs&mdash;a direct offset
to the socialism fostered by the spirit of
irreligion in other places. The part taken
by Catholic laymen of standing and ability
in this work, so full of happy promise,
is in itself a significant feature, and one
that may well be recommended to the attention
of Catholic laymen all the world
over. The pilgrimages to holy shrines
and to Rome have continued, spite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
the laugh of the infidel and the scorn of
the unbeliever. The solemn consecration
of the church in Montmartre to the
Sacred Heart was one in which the whole
world was interested. But the most encouraging
measure of all was the obtaining,
after a fierce battle between religion
and infidelity, of permission to found free
universities in France, where students
who believe in God might, if they chose,
apply themselves to the study of their
faith, or at least carry on their studies
under the divine protection and under
professors who, lacking nothing in intellect,
recognize a higher than themselves,
whose law they have the courage to recognize
and the sense and piety to obey.</p>

<p>Surely, France was never so worthy of
the esteem and profound respect of all
the world as it is to-day. What a wonderful
vitality is displayed by this Latin-Celtic
race! What people could so suddenly
recover from what seemed so fatal a
blow? What other nation would have
shown so much wisdom and self-control
as these Frenchmen, whom the outside
world stamped as “unstable as water”?
Is France to be the leader of the Latin-Celtic
races, to conform itself, consistently
with its past history and traditions,
after a century of throes, into a political
form of society fitted to its present needs,
its future prosperity, and the renewal of
religion? God grant that it be so!</p>

<p>England, true to its peace policy, still
keeps aloof from the troubled current
of European affairs, beyond its recent
move Eastward, which has already been
noticed. It steadily refused to accept
the invitation of Russia to join the International
Conference on the Usages
of War, which in reality resembled a
consultation among surgeons before beginning
to operate on an interesting subject.
Mr. Disraeli’s premiership has
been marked by some irritating mistakes,
though the securing control of the Suez
Canal was undoubtedly a move in the
present critical state of Eastern affairs
that compensates for many a blunder&mdash;if
he can only hold the control. Mr.
Gladstone finally retired from the leadership
of the liberal party, and was nominally
succeeded by the Marquis of Hartington.
The ex-leader, abandoning a
position which, take him all in all, he
undoubtedly adorned, went paddling
in theology and got shipwrecked. The
Gladstone fulminations on “Vaticanism”
are now a thing of the past, and only
afforded another melancholy instance of
the facility with which even great men
can go beyond their depth. The portentous
charges against the Pope, the <i lang="it">Curia
Romana</i>, the rusty arsenals, and the rest
of the papal “properties” were received
by the English people themselves with
honest laughter or with passive scorn,
until finally Mr. Gladstone lost his temper,
and then the world became tired both
of him and his “rusty tools.”</p>

<p>Materialism is taking deep root in the
English mind. The leading organ of
English opinion, itself highly respectable,
but by no means religious, complained
more than once during the year
of the general apathy with which the
public regarded the doings of the various
convocations and general assemblies of
the Protestant churches in England. And
the success with which the onslaught by
such a man as Mr. Gladstone against the
Catholic Church met with at the hands
of Englishmen reveals anew the fact
that religious feeling has fallen to so low
an ebb in England that even the most
eloquent of bigots could not arouse an
anti-Popery cry. And this, for England,
is the last stage of religious apathy.</p>

<p>Is this again the immediate precursor
of a reaction in favor of the true church
in that land for which so many prayers
have been offered up, and the blood of
so many martyrs has been shed?</p>

<p>Ireland has been quiet, calm, and
peaceable, and though, in common with
England, suffering from the commercial
depression which spread from this country
to them, it has shown a strong tendency
to advance in prosperity. For its
peace the Catholic clergy, according to
the testimony of the London <cite>Times</cite>, and,
as we believe, the Home-Rule party, are
jointly answerable. Men who believe in
God and obey the laws of the church
will, with honest and able representatives,
seek for no heroic measures of reform,
while the legislature is fairly open to
complaints. The London <cite>Times</cite> says
that the peaceful record of the year reads
like a fairy tale. Yet the Peace Preservation
Acts were renewed, for which the
same journal could find no better reason
than that “you cannot break off abruptly
from the past,” and goes on to say: “It
is possible that, if there never had been
a resolution to impose upon a conquered
people a church which they rejected, and
to endow it with the spoils to which they
remained attached; if there never had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
been a neglect so little creditable to our
statesmanship as the conditions under
which agricultural land was held in Ireland;
if laws had never been passed to
deprive Roman Catholics of political
privileges and the right to possess property;
if the attempt had never been
made to rule the inhabitants of the sister-island
by a hostile garrison, that state of
feeling would never have been created
which imposes upon the legislature of
to-day the sad necessity of maintaining
an exceptional coercive legislation.” The
bitterest foe of England could scarcely
add one iota to the force of this terrible
indictment of English legislation in Ireland.</p>

<p>But we look with all hope to the
speedy dispersing of the clouds which
so long have hovered over this real
“island of saints,” which has done so
much in the past and promises so much
in the future for the spread of faith
among the peoples of the earth. More
pleasing topics to touch upon are the
celebration of the centennial of Daniel
O’Connell, the fiftieth anniversary of the
consecration of the venerable Archbishop
McHale, and, though last, far from least,
the visit to Ireland of Cardinal McCloskey,
and his reception by Cardinal Cullen
and the Irish people. The scene was
indeed a memorable one; the meeting on
a soil consecrated with the blood of
saints and martyrs&mdash;a soil every inch of
which could tell a tale of a struggle of
centuries for the faith&mdash;of two cardinals of
the church that guards the representatives,
in their own persons, of the newest
and one of the oldest heritages of the
church, and the one Irish by birth, the
other Irish by blood. A meeting no less
significant was that in England between
the Cardinal of New York and Cardinal
Manning, the first convert probably who
ever wore the title: a man of indomitable
activity, a fearless asserter of the
rights of the church, and always foremost
in every movement which aims at the
amelioration of the condition of the
working classes.</p>

<p>Russia continues her strides in the
East, nearing Hindostan, and with Hindostan
the sea, at every step. Despite
occasional reverses, her march against
the conflicting tribes and peoples that
lie in her path can only be regarded as
irresistible. Meanwhile, at home she is
eaten up by sects and the socialistic spirit
that pervades other nations, and which
tyranny may stifle for a time, but cannot
destroy. Again the mistake occurs of
regarding the Catholic Church as her
enemy, and dragooning her Catholic
subjects with a creed which their consciences
reject. Austria is engaged in
the attempt to set her internal affairs in
order, and to recover from the defeat at
Sadowa. She finds time, notwithstanding,
to attack the church, though without
the persistent brutality of her German
neighbor, whose offer to procure a joint
interference among the nations in the
election of the next pope was politely
but firmly rejected by Austria. In this
path Italy also walks. Rejecting the
rough hempen cord with which Germany
binds and strives to strangle the church,
Italy, true to her national character,
chooses one of silk, which shall do the
work softly and noiselessly, but none
the less securely. <i lang="la">Sensim sine sensu.</i>
Thus the Law of Guarantees of 1871,
which was founded on Cavour’s maxim
of “a free church in a free state,” provided
for the absolute freedom of the
Pope in spirituals. This Germany resents,
and early in the year made strong
remonstrance with Italy, to see, in plain
English, if some plan could not be devised
by which the Pope might be muzzled
and prevented from issuing encyclicals
and bulls and so forth, save only such as
might please the mind of present German
statesmen. Italy refused to alter the
law. But now in November we find
Minghetti, the president of the Council,
stating to his electors at Cologna-Veneta
that there are defects in the law of
papal guarantees. The church&mdash;says that
excellent authority, M. Minghetti&mdash;is the
congregation of all the faithful, including,
of course, M. Minghetti himself. But
the state, on whom with the <i lang="la">jus protegendi</i>
devolves also the <i lang="la">jus inspiciendi</i>, is
bound to see that the right of the laity
and the interest of the lower clergy be
not sacrificed to the abuse of papal and
episcopal authority. Wherefore, M.
Minghetti, urged solely by the desire of
seeing that no injustice is done, pledges
his electors that he will bring in a bill
empowering the laity to reclaim the
rights to which they are entitled in the
government of the church. How far
those rights extend, of course, remains to
be seen.</p>

<p>The Holy Father is still spared to us
in the full enjoyment of his health and
powers of mind. Pilgrims flock to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>
in thousands, and the eyes of the world,
friends and foes alike, look with sympathy
upon him. Surely now is the real
triumph of his reign, and in his weakness
shines forth his true strength. No
earthly motives, if ever they affected the
allegiance of Catholics to him, could
affect it now. Yet what does the world
witness? As men regard things, a weak
and powerless old man, ruling, from the
palace that is his prison, the hearts of
two hundred millions of people in the
name and by the power of Jesus Christ,
whose saintly vicar he is. The Pope,
lifted above all entanglements by recent
events with the political policy of so-called
Catholic countries&mdash;his voice, as
the head of the church, is heard and respected
by all nations as perhaps it
never was at any other period of time.</p>

<p>Spain opened with a new revolution&mdash;the
re-entering of Alfonso, the son of
the exiled queen, to the kingdom and
the throne from which she was driven.
This being said, the situation remains in
much the same condition that it has
done for the past two years; if anything,
notwithstanding some defections and
reverses, Don Carlos has gained in
strength and boldness. The move that
brought in Don Alfonso was a good one,
but it came too late.</p>

<p>The customary chronic revolutions
prevail in South America. The assassination
of Garcia Moreno, the able and
good President of Ecuador, by members
of a secret society, added a unique
chapter of horrors and dastardly cowardice
to the records of these societies,
showing that to accomplish their purpose
they are ready to stab a nation.
Garcia Mareno died a martyr to his
faith. From a far different cause, though
by the same means, died Sonzogno, the
editor of the <cite>Capitale</cite>, the trial of whose
assassins furnished food for thought as
to the force at work in regenerated Italy.
An event that might have been of great
importance was the death of the youthful
Emperor of China, which was followed
by that of his wife. He was succeeded
by a child five years old, and the government
seems to have passed into the
hands of the same men who held it before,
so that a change for the better towards
Christians is scarcely to be hoped
for, while Christian residents are still
exposed at any moment to a repetition
of the Tien-Tsin massacre.</p>

<p>With the year closes the third quarter
of the most eventful century, perhaps,
which the world has yet known, the first
century of the Christian era alone being
excepted. It opened on what Lacordaire
has well called “a wild and stormy
morning,” and he would be a bold prophet
who should predict a clear sky at
the close. A writer of the day describes
nations within the past year as engaged
in “a wild war-dance.” The same is true
of the century. Nations seem to have
learned nothing, but forgotten much. In
forgetting the faith that made them whole
they have forgotten the secret of the elixir
of national life. Hence, bitter as the struggle
is, a Catholic cannot but hope much
in the near future from the present trials
of the church. The blows of Germany
have crushed shams to the earth, and
caused the truth to shine forth resplendent
and beautiful. Whatever may be this
faith that the nations have forgotten, that
has been a mockery among men of the
world, it is manifest, at least, that there is
a profound reality in it, and a vitality
that no power on earth can hope to
destroy. This testimony of strength in
weakness, of the purest devotion and
loftiest sacrifices that this world can
show, if it do nothing else, at least brings
men to ponder and look back, and compare
and inquire, and arrive at some
conclusions. For the world cannot remain
an indifferent spectator to a question
that is wide as the world. The vagaries
of belief, the churches with fronts
of brass and feet of clay, the parasites
and the flatterers who, professing to worship
and believe in God alone, bow down
in secret before the prince of this world,
now slink away in shame or stand abashed
before the unbeliever.</p>

<p>Again, considering the intensity of the
activity of the age, induced in a great
measure by the facilities of expressing
and communicating our thoughts, of
reaching the uttermost parts of the earth
in a flash of time&mdash;all of which enhances
the responsibility of our free will&mdash;religion,
in view of these facts, will have to
keep pace with this activity in order to
perform the office for which God established
it upon earth. That she will do
so is as much a matter of certitude as
her existence; for that same “Spirit
which fills the whole earth” finds in her
bosom his dwelling-place. The general
tendency to material science, and the
material interests of nations, which have
so wonderfully increased within the century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span>
tend all to obscure the supernatural.
But there is nothing to be feared
from the advocates of material science.
There is no escaping from God in his
creation. And these men, in their way,
in common with the more open persecutors,
are preparing for the triumph of the
church, and in the providence of God are
co-workers in the more complete demonstration
of his divine truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Life of the Apostle S. John.</span> By M.
L. Baunard. Translated from the first
French edition. New York: The Catholic
Publication Society. 1875.</p>

</div>

<p>The life and character of S. John are
so beautiful and so closely connected
with our Saviour that true believers have
always craved to know more about him.</p>

<p>On the other hand, his testimony is so
positive and his language so clear that
all who blaspheme the divinity of our
Lord have sought to thrust him and his
gospel out of sight. The distinguished
French author has a warm personal devotion
to S. John, and has devoted himself
with great enthusiasm to the task of
collecting all the historical facts which
remain to us as connected with the virgin
apostle. His style is manifestly infused
with his spirit, and hence the work
is one rather of devotion than of cold,
scientific dissertation.</p>

<p>“It is,” says the author in his preface,
“a book of doctrine. I address it to all
those who desire to instruct themselves
in the truth of God. Truth has no school
above that of the Gospel, and nowhere
does it appear fairer or more profound
than in the gospel of S. John.</p>

<p>“It is a book of piety. I dedicate it to
Christians: to priests&mdash;the priesthood
has no higher personification than S.
John; to virgins&mdash;John was a virgin; to
mothers&mdash;he merited to be given as a son
to the Mother of God; to youth&mdash;he was
the youngest of the apostles; to old men&mdash;it
is the name he gives himself in his
epistles. I offer it to suffering souls&mdash;he
stood beside the cross; to contemplative
souls&mdash;he was on Mt. Thabor; to all souls
who wish to devote themselves to their
brethren, and to love them in God&mdash;charity
can have no purer ideal than the
friend of Jesus.”</p>

<p>It goes to fill up a most important gap
in our English hagiography, and will be
greeted with much satisfaction by those
desirous of having a complete series of
lives of the saints.</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p><span class="smcap">The Ship in the Desert.</span> By Joaquin
Miller. Boston: Roberts Brothers.
1875.</p>

</div>

<p>The <i lang="la">ad captandum</i> title of this work
leads one to look for an Arabian romance;
whereas the story has scarcely
anything to do with it, and is a very slender
story at that. It is difficult to say
whether the book is worth reading or
not; for while, no doubt, it contains
passages of considerable force and beauty,
we are quite sure the poet himself
does not know half the time what he
means. Now, this kind of thing is “played
out.” Far be it from us to accuse the
divine Tennyson of straining and affectation;
but we do say there are peculiarities
in his style which it is dangerous to
imitate. Taken as a model for classic
and scholarly verse, he has no equal in
the English language. But the subjectivism
of his “enchanted reverie” may
be easily “run into the ground.” Hence
he has given rise (we suspect he is full
sore over it) to what may be called the
“Obscurantist” school of poetry. We
think this school has had its day. We
hope the coming poets will happily combine
the faultless diction of Tennyson
with the clear, strong thought of such
masters as Milton, Byron, and Longfellow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Three Pearls; or, Virginity and
Martyrdom.</span> By a Daughter of Charity.
New York: The Catholic Publication
Society. 1875.</p>

</div>

<p>We presume this book is meant for a
Christmas present. It is admirably fitted
for that purpose&mdash;beautifully printed and
tastefully bound. But the contents are
still better worth having.</p>

<p>These “Three Pearls” were indeed
“of great price”; three virgin-martyrs&mdash;S.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
Cæcilia, S. Agnes, and S. Catharine
of Alexandria. No three saints, perhaps,
could have been more happily
chosen by the gifted author as models
for the young Catholic women of the
day, and particularly here in America.
If it be objected that such heroines are
not imitable, the answer is obvious&mdash;that
the virtues which led them to become
heroines are imitable by all. And,
again, the “modern paganism” with
which we are familiar has many features
in common with that amid which they
lived.</p>

<p>There is a prose sketch of each saint,
followed by a tribute in verse. The
“Editor’s Preface” is from the pen of a
learned priest in the Diocese of Boston.</p>

<p>The plan of the author in this work, as
is implied in its title, has not been to
write a complete treatise on moral theology,
but to furnish a compendium containing
the points necessary for confessors
in the ordinary discharge of their
duties. Desirable as such a book is,
there is of course a difficulty in compiling
it, arising from the variety of sound
opinions on many questions, which cannot
all be given without extending it
beyond the limits which give it its special
convenience, and which opinions,
nevertheless, it is at least expedient that
every priest should know. This difficulty
is one, therefore, which cannot be
overcome, and a manual of this kind can
never entirely supply the place of a
larger work. But it nevertheless has its
use, and, when it is well done, cannot
fail to be a welcome addition to any theological
library.</p>

<p>And this book is extremely welcome
for it is extremely well done. It is very
well arranged; every point of importance
is, we believe, given; it is clearly written;
it is adapted to the times and to this
country, and (which is a great merit) it is
by no means dry. There is a little danger
in it on this last account, and that is
that its superior attractiveness may tend
to induce neglect of larger works, and
too great confidence in statements which
space will not allow the author to modify,
as we have said above.</p>

<p>One excellent feature of it is the sound
and practical advice which it contains,
which is almost as important as the statement
of theological conclusions or of
matters of law. It would be worth far
more than its price on this account alone.</p>

<p>In the present editions an article on
“Rome and Geneva” has been added to
<cite>The History of the Reformation</cite>, and a
“Pastoral Letter on the Infallibility of
the Pope” to <cite>The Evidences of Catholicity</cite>&mdash;both
having been prepared by the late
archbishop with a view to publication in
his collective works.</p>

<p>The same general criticism which we
passed in our December number on the
revised edition of the <cite>Miscellanea</cite> will
apply to these volumes. Archbishop
Spalding’s works constitute a very complete
armory from which to select weapons
to meet the opponents of the church
in this country; though the writings of
European Catholics may be more to the
purpose as answers to the misrepresentations
urged against her in their respective
localities. And there is no one
writer to whom we would with greater
confidence refer Protestants who are
willing to learn the truth (and we would
fain hope there are very many such), as
his works relate to so many supposed
stumbling-blocks. Whether conscious
of it or not, our separated brethren are
very blind followers of tradition&mdash;accepting
unhesitatingly the representations of
writers of the last three centuries, while
faulting us for adhering to the unbroken
traditions of all the Christian centuries.
Hence they are accustomed, when unable
to reply to our doctrinal arguments
drawn from their translation of the Holy
Scriptures, to fall back on their own version
of the religious revolution of the
XVIth century, and other historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span>
events, the comparative condition of
Catholic and Protestant countries, etc.,
etc., all of which are treated of at length
in these volumes.</p>

<p>At a time when it is sought to revive
the fell spirit of the defunct Know-Nothing
party, it is well to refresh our memories
by a re-perusal of the writings which
were prompted by the previous manifestation.</p>

<p>The first-named work is at once a history
of the Reformation and a review of
the most prominent books on the same
subject, including D’Aubigné’s popular
romance. This treatment very much
augments the interest with which we
pursue historical inquiries.</p>

By Richard H. Clarke, LL.D.
New York: The Catholic Publication
Society. 1875.</p>

</div>

<p>This able pamphlet will wear a familiar
look to our readers, its principal contents
having appeared as an article in
our December number. The writer has
added biographical sketches of the first
and second Lords Baltimore, the Lawgivers
of 1649, and of Father Andrew
White, the historiographer of the expedition
which founded Maryland, and who
was intimately associated with the early
fortunes of the colony.</p>

<p>It was really too bad in Dr. Clarke to
deny asylum to the ex-premier on our
(reputed) hospitable shores, after the relentless
logic to which he was subjected
at home, when proving so clearly to his
own satisfaction the disloyalty of Catholics&mdash;to
spoil, in fact, his nice little story
that it was the Protestants, and not those
hateful Catholics, who made Maryland a
refuge for fugitives from English persecution
for conscience’ sake. And what
makes the matter all the more aggravating
is that our author is in league with
ever so many Protestants in this design.
For shame, gentlemen!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Historical Scenes from the Old Jesuit
Missions.</span> By the Right Rev.
William Ingraham Kip, D.D., LL.D.,
member of the New York Historical
Society [and Protestant Episcopal Bishop
of California]. New York: A. D.
F. Randolph &amp; Co. 1875.</p>

</div>

<p>The author of this work had the
good fortune while in England some
years since to secure a copy of <cite>Lettres
Edifiantes et Curieuses écrites des Missions
Etrangéres</cite>, in forty-seven volumes, “containing
the letters of the Jesuit missionaries
from about 1650 to 1750.… He
selected those letters which relate to the
labors of the Jesuits within the bounds
of our own land, and published a translation,
with notes, under the title of <cite>The
Early Jesuit Missions in North America</cite>.”
In the present work he takes a wider
range, and makes selections, from the
same source, of letters from parts of the
world widely remote from each other&mdash;from
China and California; from Cape
Horn and the far north; from the shores
of South America and the Mediterranean;
from the monasteries of Mount Lebanon
and the Thebaid Desert.</p>

<p>Bishop Kip and his publishers have
laid both Protestants and Catholics under
great obligations by the publication
of this valuable and beautiful volume.
We can scarcely commend too highly the
evident fairness of the translation and
of the accompanying remarks and notes.
It could not well be otherwise than that
a Protestant should have some qualifications
to offer respecting statements of
fact and doctrine such as would naturally
occur in these letters; but the Catholic
reader will be gratified to find
much that is laudatory, and scarcely anything
to which he would object; the
notes being for the most part historical
and philological in character. The naïve
simplicity of these relations constitutes
one of their chief charms and the best
answer to any suggestion of guile on the
part of the writers.</p>

<p>The principles and operations of the
Jesuits have been, and to a great extent
are still, believed by our Protestant fellow-citizens
to constitute a vulnerable
point in Catholicity, so that we rejoice
at the facilities offered by such writers as
Parkman, Shea, and Kip for a better understanding
of the matter. Nothing can
give Catholics greater pleasure than that
their Protestant friends should have full
opportunities for studying our doctrines
and history.</p>

<p>This volume is a concise and well-written

what abundant graces are often bestowed
upon the meek and lowly, and how those
who humble themselves are exalted by
Almighty God.</p>

<p>S. Benedict, the child of an enslaved
negro parent, was born at Sanfratello in
Sicily, <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1524. Early instructed in
religion by his parents, he offered himself
to God, and became eminent for
sanctity as a religious. Seeking always
the lowest and most humiliating employments,
he served for twenty-seven years
as a cook in a convent. Already, during
his lifetime, regarded as a saint, he was
venerated by all classes. “At the door
of his humble kitchen,” says his biographer,
“were to be seen the nobles of
Palermo, who sought to honor the saint
and recommend themselves to his prayers,
the learned who came for advice, the
afflicted who desired consolation, the
sick who hoped for the recovery of their
health, and the indigent who desired assistance.”</p>

<p>Winning by his wisdom and virtues
the confidence of his brethren, he was
chosen guardian of the convent, and afterwards
vicar, and master of novices&mdash;positions
which he accepted with extreme
reluctance, and in which he proved his
great charity and humility.</p>

<p>But the more he sought to abase and
hide himself, the greater the graces bestowed
upon him. Though blessed with
the spirit of prophecy, the power of performing
miracles, and the gift of ecstasy,
so great was his humility that he again
turned to his simple occupation, and
retained it till his death, which occurred
in 1589.</p>

Seminarist of S. Sulpice (shot
at Belleville, Paris, May 26, 1871).
From the French. New York: P.
O’Shea. 1875.</p>

</div>

<p>The title of this work can scarcely fail
to awaken an interest in the youthful
hero who gave his life for his faith&mdash;an
interest which is enhanced by the knowledge
that this youth, frail as a girl and
possessed of a highly-cultivated mind
and rare sensibility, was so filled with
the spirit of self-sacrifice that he may
well be classed with those “courtiers of
martyrdom” whose lives are the glory of
the church and the wonder of the world.</p>

<p>Paul Seigneret’s is a name that must
be dear to all Catholics at all familiar
with his saintly life and death. To a
heart overflowing with love for all who
had claims upon his affection and charity
for all mankind, and to those quick and
delicate perceptions which retain all that
is good and instinctively reject all that
is evil, was added a fervent piety and
ardent zeal for the glory of God. Animated
by these sentiments, he sought the
priesthood, and soon turned his thoughts
to the cloister&mdash;“‘that pure and shining
height’ whither he would go to fix his
dwelling nearer heaven.” While yet a
student in the Seminary of S. Sulpice, he
fell a victim to the Commune, and was
permitted to win the crown of martyrdom,
which had been the object of his
most ardent desires.</p>

<p>The volume before us is one which we
would especially recommend to our
youthful readers, who will find in it much
that is edifying and worthy of imitation.
In an age in which respect for authority
and filial obedience are so much ignored,
we cannot place too high a value on
the example of Paul Seigneret, whose
devotion and submission to his parents
were second only to his love of God.</p>

<p>If a work so admirable in most respects
may be criticised, we would say
that it would be quite as interesting if
the author had condensed the valuable
materials of which it is composed. We
are aware of the difficulties under which
many translations from the French are
made. Innumerable things in that versatile,
flexible language will bear many
repetitions and much minutiæ in description,
which will not admit of more than
the simple statement in our unyielding
vernacular. Readers should therefore
hesitate in pronouncing a book dull because
some of the aroma escapes in the
transition from one medium of thought
to another.</p>

<h3>A SEQUEL OF THE GLADSTONE CONTROVERSY.<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></h3>

<p>“It is wonderful,” wrote Proudhon,
“how in all our political questions
we always stumble on theology.”
Mr. Gladstone will doubtless
concur in this sentiment; for
he cannot take a step without
stumbling on the Catholic Church.
She is everywhere, and everywhere
she is to him a cause of alarm. So
potent is her influence growing to
be, so cunningly laid are the plans
by which her policy is directed, so
perfect is the organization and discipline
of her forces, so insidious
are her methods of procedure, as
he would have us believe, that it is
full time all Christendom should be
warned of the approaching danger.
She is in his eyes an ever-present
menace to the civilization of the
world.</p>

<p>He at least bears testimony to
her power and vitality. She is not
a relic of a past age; she lives, and,
what is more, it does not seem that
she is willing to die. If we consider
the various efforts by which
men are seeking to weaken and destroy
the church, we shall find in
them no mean evidence of her divine
strength. And first of all, in
an age intellectually most active,
she is the subject of universal criticism,
and is cited before every tribunal
of human knowledge to be
tried on an hundred different and
often contradictory counts. Her
historical relations with the world,
extending over eighteen hundred
years and co-extensive with Christendom,
are minutely examined into
by men who, shutting their eyes
to the benefits which she has conferred
upon the human race, are
eager to discover charges against
her. She is made responsible for
the crimes of those who called
themselves Catholics, though she
was the first to condemn their evil
deeds. The barbarism, the ignorance,
and the cruelty of the middle
ages are set to her count, when,
in fact, she was the chief source of
civilization, of enlightenment, and
of mercy during that period. When
she opposes the tyranny of kings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>
she is called the enemy of the
state; when she seeks to restrain
the lawlessness of the people, she is
proclaimed the friend of tyrants.
Against her dogmas and institutions
all the sciences are brought
to bear&mdash;astronomy, geology, ethnology,
and the others. Not in
politics alone, but in all the physical
sciences, men in our day stumble
on the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>We are told that she is the one
great spiritual organization which
is able to resist, and must as a matter
of life and death resist, the progress
of science and modern civilization.
These men profess to find
innumerable points of collision between
her dogmas and the conclusions
of science, and are surprised
when she claims to understand her
own teachings better than they,
and is not prepared to abandon all
belief in God, the soul, and future
life because physical research has
given men a wider knowledge of
the phenomena of matter. Now
we hear objections to her moral
teaching&mdash;that it is too severe, that
she imposes burdens upon men’s
shoulders too heavy for human nature
to bear, that she encourages
asceticism, celibacy, and all manner
of self-denial opposed to the spirit
of the age and of progress; then,
on the contrary, that her morality
is lax, that she flatters the passions
of men, panders to their sensual
appetites, and grants, for gain, permission
to commit every excess.</p>

<p>At one time we are told that her
priests are indolent, immoral, ignorant,
without faith; at another, that
they are ceaselessly active, astute,
learned, and wholly intent upon
bringing all men to their own way
of thinking. Now we are informed
that her children cannot be loyal
subjects of any government; and
immediately after we hear that they
are so subservient, so passively obedient,
that they willingly submit to
any master. And here we come more
immediately upon our subject; for
whereas Mr. Gladstone has declared
that the loyalty of Catholics
is not to be trusted, M. de Laveleye
asserts that “despotic government
is the congenial government
of Catholic populations.”</p>

<p>The pamphlet from which we
quote these words, and which we
propose now to examine, has been
presented to the English-reading
public by the special request of Mr.
Gladstone, and has been farther
honored by him with a prefatory
letter. The author, it is true, takes
a fling at the Church of England,
and plainly intimates that in his
opinion it is little better than the
Catholic Church; but the ex-premier
could not forego the opportunity
of striking his enemy, though he
should pierce his dearest friend in
giving the blow. He takes the precaution,
indeed, to disclaim any concurrence
in M. de Laveleye’s “rather
unfavorable estimate of the Church
of England in comparison with the
other reformed communions.” The
question discussed in the pamphlet
before us, as its title implies, is the
relative influence of Catholicism
and Protestantism on the liberty
and prosperity of nations; and the
conclusion which is drawn is that
the Reformation is favorable to freedom
and progress, and that the
Catholic Church is a hindrance to
both.</p>

<p>This has long been a favorite
theme with Protestants&mdash;the weapon
with which they think themselves
best able to do good battle
in their cause; and doubtless it is
employed, in most favorable circumstances,
in an age like ours, in
which material progress is so marked
a feature that its influence may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>
be traced in everything, and in
nothing more than in the thoughts
and philosophies of the men of our
day. It is worthy of remark that
Protestantism, professing to be a
purer and more spiritual worship,
should have tended to turn men’s
thoughts almost exclusively to the
worldly and temporal view of religion;
so that it has become the fashion
to praise Christianity, not because
it makes men humble, pure,
self-denying, content with little, but
rather because its influence is supposed
to be of almost an opposite
nature. Much stress is laid upon
the physical, social, and mental superiority
of Christian nations to
those that are still pagan, and the
inference implied, if not always expressly
stated, is that these temporal
advantages are due to the influence
of Christianity, and prove its truth
and divine origin. Without stopping
to consider the question
whether the material and social superiority
of Christian nations is to
be attributed to their religious faith,
we may ask whether, admitting that
this is the case, it may with propriety
be adduced in proof of the
truth of the religion of Christ?</p>

<p>In the case of individuals no one,
certainly, would think of arguing
that prosperity proves a right faith,
or even consistent practice. To
hold that wealth and success are
evidences of religious life, whatever
it may be, is certainly not Christianity.
Does the teaching of
Christ permit the rich to lay the
unction to their souls that they
are God’s favored children? Were
they his friends? Did they flock
around him? Did they drink in his
words gladly? If men who claim
to be his disciples have deified
worldly success, and made temporal
prosperity a sufficient test
of the truth of his religion, they
cannot plead any word of his in
excuse.</p>

<p>He certainly never paid court to
the great, or stooped to flatter the
rich. Was it not he who said, “Woe
be to you rich: ye have received
your reward”? and again, “It is
harder for a rich man to enter the
kingdom of heaven than for a
camel to pass through the eye of a
needle”? Did he not take Lazarus
to his bosom when Dives was in
hell?</p>

<p>“Blessed are ye,” he said, “when
men shall revile you, and persecute
you, and shall say all manner of
evil against you falsely for my sake.
Rejoice and be exceeding glad;
for great is your reward in heaven:
for so persecuted they the prophets
which were before you.”</p>

<p>The preaching of Christ was
wholly unworldly. He sternly repressed
the earthly ambitions of his
disciples, and declared that, as the
world hated him, it would also hate
those who believed in him. They
would be outcasts for his name’s
sake; if this life were all, they of
all men would be most miserable.
Indeed, he rarely speaks of human
happiness in the customary sense;
he passes over what might be said
in favor of this life, and brings out
in bold relief its vanity and unsatisfactoriness.
He draws no pictures
of domestic bliss, and says
but little of even innocent pleasures
or those temporal blessings which
are so sweet to all; and as he taught
that worldly prosperity is no evidence
of God’s favor, he was careful
to correct the error of those
who looked upon misfortune as a
proof of guilt, as in the case of the
man born blind and of those upon
whom a tower had fallen.</p>

<p>Christ was poor, his apostles
were poor, his disciples were poor,
nearly all the Christians of the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>
ages were poor; and yet every day
we hear men talk as though they
considered poverty and Christianity
incompatible. This is manifestly
the opinion of M. de Laveleye.
His argument may be stated in this
way: England and Scotland are
rich, Ireland is poor. The Protestant
cantons of Switzerland are
rich, the Catholic are poor. “In
the United States,” says De Tocqueville,
“the greater part of the Catholics
are poor.” In fact, wherever
the two religions exist together, the
Protestants are more active, more
industrious, and consequently richer
than the Catholics.</p>

<p>This is the substance of what is
spread over a dozen pages of the
pamphlet. The conclusion is not
difficult to draw: Protestants are
richer than Catholics, and therefore
better Christians.</p>

<p>“No man can serve two masters,”
said Christ: “you cannot serve God
and Mammon.” On the contrary,
says M. de Laveleye, the success
with which you worship Mammon
is the best proof that you serve God
truly. Of course it would be foreign
to M. de Laveleye’s purpose to
stop to inquire whether the poverty
of Ireland be due to the Catholic
faith of her people or to the rapacity
and misgovernment of England;
whether that of the Catholic cantons
of Switzerland might not be
accounted for by the fact that they
are mountainous, with an inhospitable
climate and a barren soil; and
whether even M. de Tocqueville’s
assertion that the greater part of the
Catholics of the United States are
poor might not be satisfactorily explained
by stating that the greater
part of them are emigrants who
have recently landed upon these
shores without a superabundance
of this world’s goods.</p>

<p>He had also good reasons, while
treating this part of his subject, for
not looking nearer home. He had
in Belgium, under his very eye, one
of the most thrifty, industrious, and
prosperous peoples of Europe, and
at the same time one of the most
Catholic. Why did he not compare
the wealth of Belgium with that of
Sweden or Denmark? Why did he
not say a word about Catholic
France, whose wealth and thrift cannot
be denied. He does, indeed,
make mention of two French manufacturing
towns, in which, he states,
on the authority of M. Audiganne,
the capitalists are for the most part
Protestants, whilst the operatives
are Catholics; though what this has
to do with any debatable question
between Catholicism and Protestantism
is not easily seen.</p>

<p>The assertion (p. 14) that “wherever
the two religions co-exist in
the same country the Protestants
are more active, more industrious,
more economical, and consequently
richer than the Catholics,” is not
borne out by facts. A single example
will suffice to show how rash
M. de Laveleye has been in making
so wide an affirmation. The
Catholics of the Rhine Province are
universally acknowledged to be
among the most thrifty and enterprising
populations of Prussia, and
are far richer than, for instance, the
Protestants of Pomerania.</p>

<p>It would not be difficult, by
adopting M. de Laveleye’s mode
of reasoning, to turn his whole argument
on this point against his
own position. Whether or not national
wealth, we might say, is evidence
of orthodox Christian faith,
there can be no doubt but that the
Christian religion is favorable to
even the temporal interests of the
lowest and most degraded classes
of society. Its doctrines on the
brotherhood of the race and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>
equality of all before God first inspired
worthy notions of the dignity
of man. Then the sympathy which
it created for the poor, the suffering,
and the oppressed naturally set men
to work to devise means for the relief
of human misery. It is to its
influence that we must ascribe the
abolition of slavery, the elevation of
woman, and the thousand ministries
which in Christian lands attend
on the wretched and the weak.</p>

<p>We must infer that those nations
in which this influence is most powerful&mdash;which,
in other words, are
most truly Christian&mdash;will have, in
proportion to their population, the
smallest class of human beings
cursed by the worst plague known
to modern civilization, bearing with
it, as it does, a threefold degradation,
moral, physical, and social. We of
course refer to pauperism.</p>

<p>Now, in England, from whose
wealth M. de Laveleye would infer
the superiority of her religion, we
find that this pauper class, compared
with the whole population, is as 1 to
23; whereas in Ireland, which is
poor&mdash;and, according to this theory,
for that reason under the ban of
a false religion&mdash;there is but 1
pauper to 90 inhabitants; in other
words, pauperism is four times
more common in England than in
Ireland. Now, whether we refer
this fact to England’s wealth or to
England’s religion&mdash;and in M. de
Laveleye’s opinion they are correlative&mdash;our
conclusion must be either
that the influence of the Christian
religion, which necessarily tends to
promote the temporal well-being of
the most degraded classes of society,
is less felt in England than in Ireland,
or else that national wealth is
hurtful to the interests of these same
classes, and consequently opposed
to the true Christian spirit; and in
either case we have Catholic Ireland
more fairly Christian than
Protestant England. We would
not have our readers think for a
moment that we are seriously of
the opinion that our argument
proves anything at all. We give it
merely as a specimen of the way in
which the reasoning of this pamphlet
may be turned against its
own conclusions, though, in fact, we
have done the work too respectably.</p>

<p>We cannot forget, if M. de Laveleye
does, that, of all sciences, the
social&mdash;if, indeed, it may be said
as yet to exist at all&mdash;is the most
complex and the most difficult to
master. The phenomena which it
presents for observation are so various,
so manifold, and so vast, our
means of observation are so limited,
our methods so unsatisfactory, and
our prejudices so fatal, that only
the thoughtless or the rash will tread
without suspicion or doubt upon
ground so uncertain and so little
explored.</p>

<p>M. de Laveleye himself furnishes
us an example of how easily we
may go astray, even when the way
seems plain.</p>

<p>“Sectarian passions,” he writes
(p. 11), “or anti religious prejudice
have been too often imported into
the study of these questions. It is
time that we should apply to it the
method of observation and the
scientific impartiality of the physiologist
and the naturalist. When
the facts are once established irrefragable
conclusions will follow.
It is admitted that the Scotch
and Irish are of the same origin.
Both have become subject to the
English yoke. Until the XVIth
century Ireland was much more
civilized than Scotland. During
the first part of the middle ages
the Emerald Isle was a focus of
civilization, while Scotland was still
a den of barbarians. Since the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>
Scotch have embraced the Reformation,
they have outrun even the
English.… Ireland, on the
other hand, devoted to ultramontanism,
is poor, miserable, agitated
by the spirit of rebellion, and seems
incapable of raising herself by her
own strength.” The conclusion
which is drawn from all this, joined
with such other facts as the late
victories of Prussia over Austria
and France, is that “Protestantism
is more favorable than Catholicism
to the development of nations.”</p>

<p>We may as well pause to examine
this passage, which, both with regard
to the statement of facts and to
the interpretation put upon them,
fairly represents the style and method
of the pamphlet before us.</p>

<p>“It is admitted that the Scotch
and Irish are of the same origin.”
This is true, as here stated, only in
the sense that both are descended
of Adam; and hence it would have
been as much to the point to affirm
that all the nations of the earth are
of the same origin. The Scots
were, indeed, an Irish tribe; but
when they invaded Caledonia, they
found it in the possession of the
Picts, of whom whether they were
of Celtic or Teutonic race is still
undecided. The power of the Scots
themselves declined in the XIIth
century, when Scotland fell under
the influence of the Anglo-Norman
Conquest, and the Celtic population
either withdrew towards the north,
or, by intermarriage with the conquerors,
formed a new type; so that
the people of that country are even
yet divided into two great and distinct
stocks differing from each
other in language, manners, and
dress.</p>

<p>“Until the XVIth century,” continues
M. de Laveleye, “Ireland was
much more civilized than Scotland.
During the first part of the middle
ages the Emerald Isle was a focus
of civilization, while Scotland was
still a den of barbarians.” Now, it
was precisely in those ages in which
Ireland was “a focus of civilization”
that the Catholic faith of her
people shone brightest. It was then
that convents sprang up over the
whole island; that the sweet songs
of sacred psalmody, which so touched
the soul of Columba, were heard
in her groves and vales; that the
sword was sheathed, and all her
people were smitten with the high
love of holy life and were eager to
drink at the fountains of knowledge.
It was then that she sent her apostles
to Scotland, to England, to France,
to Germany, to Switzerland, and to
far-off Sicily; nor did she remit her
efforts in behalf of civilization until
the invading Danes forced her children
to defend at once their country
and their faith.</p>

<p>But let us follow M. de Laveleye:
“Since the Scotch have embraced
the reformed religion, they have
outrun even the English.… Ireland,
on the other hand, devoted to
ultramontanism, is poor, miserable,
agitated by the spirit of rebellion,
and seems incapable of raising herself
by her own strength.”</p>

<p>We cannot think that Mr. Gladstone
had read this passage when
he requested the author to have his
pamphlet translated into English;
for we cannot believe that he is
prepared to lay the misfortunes of
Ireland to the influence of the
Catholic faith upon her people, and
not to the cruelty and misgovernment
of England.</p>

<p>The Irish Catholics are reproached
with their poverty, when for two
hundred years the English government
made it a crime for them to
own anything. They are taunted
with their misery, when for two
centuries they lived under a code<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span>
which placed them outside the pale
of humanity; of which Lord
Brougham said that it was so ingeniously
contrived that an Irish
Catholic could not lift up his hand
without breaking it; which Edmund
Burke denounced as the most
proper machine ever invented by
the wit of man to disgrace a realm
and degrade a people; and of which
Montesquieu wrote that it must
have been contrived by devils,
ought to have been written in blood
and registered in hell!</p>

<p>Ireland is found fault with because
she is agitated with the spirit
of rebellion, when even to think of
the wrongs she has suffered makes
the blood to boil. Is it astonishing
that she should be poor when England,
with set purpose, destroyed her
commerce and ruined her manufacturing
interests, fostering at the
same time a policy fatal to agriculture,
the aim of which, it would
seem, was to force the Irish to emigrate,
that the whole island might
be turned into a grazing ground for
the supply of the English markets?</p>

<p>“What a contrast,” further remarks
M. de Laveleye (p. 12),
“even in Ireland, between the exclusively
Catholic Connaught and
Ulster, where Protestantism prevails!”</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone certainly cannot
be surprised at this contrast, nor
will he seek its explanation in the
baneful influence of the Catholic
Church. He at least knows the
history of Cromwell’s invasion of
Ireland; he has read of the massacres
of Drogheda and Wexford; he
knows the fate of the eighty thousand
Catholic Irishmen whom
Cromwell drove into the ports of
Munster, and shipped like cattle
to the sugar plantations of the Barbadoes,
there to be sold as slaves;
nor is he ignorant of what was in
store for those Irish Catholics who
were still left; of how they were
driven out of Ulster, Munster, and
Leinster across the Shannon into
Connaught&mdash;that is, into the bogs
and wild wastes of the most desolate
part of Ireland&mdash;there to die of
hunger or cold, or to survive as best
they might. Five-sixths of the
Catholics had perished; the remainder
were driven into barren Connaught;
the Protestants settled on
the rich lands of Ulster, Munster,
and Leinster; and now here comes
good M. de Laveleye to find that
Connaught is poor because it is
Catholic, and Ulster is rich because
it is Protestant. But we must not
forget Scotland.</p>

<p>“Since the Scotch,” says M. de
Laveleye, “have embraced the reformed
religion, they have outrun
even the English.”</p>

<p>We shall take no pains to discover
whether or in what respect, or
how far the Scotch surpass the
English. The meaning of the
words which we have just quoted is
evidently this: The progress which
the Scotch have made during the
last three centuries, in wealth and
the other elements of material
greatness, must be ascribed to the
influence of the Protestant religion.</p>

<p>To avoid even the suspicion of
unfairness in discussing this part of
the subject, we shall quote the words
of an author who devoted much time
and research to the study of the
character and tendencies of Scotch
Presbyterianism, and whose deeply-rooted
dislike of the Catholic
Church is well known:</p>

<p>“To be poor,” says Buckle (<cite>History of
Civilization</cite>, vol. ii. p. 314), describing the
doctrines of the Scotch divines of the
XVIIth century&mdash;“to be poor, dirty, and
hungry; to pass through life in misery and
to leave it with fear; to be plagued with
boils and sores and diseases of every kind;
to be always sighing and groaning; to have
the face streaming with tears and the chest
heaving with sobs; in a word, to suffer
constant affliction and to be tormented in
all possible ways&mdash;to undergo these
things was a proof of goodness just as
the contrary was a proof of evil. It mattered
not what a man liked, the mere
fact of his liking it made it sinful. Whatever
was natural was wrong. The clergy
deprived the people of their holidays, their
amusements, their shows, their games,
and their sports; they repressed every
appearance of joy, they forbade all merriment,
they stopped all festivities, they
choked up every avenue by which pleasure
could enter, and they spread over the
country an universal gloom. Then truly
did darkness sit on the land. Men in
their daily actions and in their every
looks became troubled, melancholy, and
ascetic. Their countenance soured and
was downcast. Not only their opinions,
but their gait, their demeanor, their voice,
their general aspect, were influenced
by that deadly blight which nipped all
that was genial and warm. The way of
life fell into the sere and yellow leaf; its
tints gradually deepened; its bloom faded
and passed off; its spring, its freshness,
and its beauty were gone; joy and love
either disappeared or were forced to hide
themselves in obscure corners, until at
length the fairest and most endearing
parts of our nature, being constantly repressed,
ceased to bear fruit and seemed
to be withered into perpetual sterility.
Thus it was that the national character
of the Scotch was in the XVIIth
century dwarfed and mutilated.…
They [the Scotch divines] sought to
destroy not only human pleasures, but
human affections. They held that our
affections are necessarily connected with
our lusts, and that we must therefore wean
ourselves from them as earthly vanities.
A Christian had no business with love
or sympathy. He had his own soul to
attend to, and that was enough for him.
Let him look to himself. On Sunday, in
particular, he must never think of benefiting
others; and the Scotch clergy did
not hesitate to teach the people that on
that day it was sinful to save a vessel in
distress, and that it was a proof of religion
to leave ship and crew to perish.
They might go; none but their wives
and children would suffer, and that was
nothing in comparison with breaking the
Sabbath. So, too did the clergy teach
that on no occasion must food or shelter
be given to a starving man, unless his
opinions were orthodox. What need for
him to live? Indeed, they taught that it
was a sin to tolerate his notions at all,
and that the proper course was to visit
him with sharp and immediate punishment.
Going yet farther, they broke the
domestic ties and set parents against
their offspring. They taught the father
to smite the unbelieving child, and to
slay his own boy sooner than to allow
him to propagate error. As if this were
not enough, they tried to extirpate another
affection, even more sacred and
more devoted still. They laid their rude
and merciless hands on the holiest passion
of which our nature is capable&mdash;the
love of a mother for her son.…
To hear of such things is enough to
make one’s blood surge again, and raise
a tempest in our inmost nature. But to
have seen them, to have lived in the
midst of them, and yet not to have rebelled
against them, is to us utterly inconceivable,
and proves in how complete
a thraldom the Scotch were held, and how
thoroughly their minds as well as their
bodies were enslaved.”</p>

</div>

<p>The XVIIth century, which
was the golden age of French literature,
and also of the Catholic
Church in France, threw almost total
darkness over Scotland, which
during that period was most completely
under the power of Protestantism.
The clergy governed the
nation; they were the only men of
real influence; and yet there was no
philosophy, no science, no poetry,
no literature worth reading. “From
the Restoration,” says Laing, “down
to the Union the only author of
any eminence whom Scotland produced
was Burnet.”</p>

<p>If the thrift and industry of the
Scotch are due to Protestantism, to
what shall we ascribe the enterprise
and commerce of the Catholic republics
of Venice and Genoa during the
middle ages?</p>

<p>If England’s wealth to-day comes
from the Reformation, how shall we
account for that of Spain in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span>
XVIth and XVIIth centuries?
And if the decline of Spain has been
brought about by the Catholic
faith, to what cause shall we assign
that of Holland, who in the XVIIth
century ruled the seas and did the
carrying trade of Europe?</p>

<p>M. de Laveleye’s way of accounting
for the prosperity of nations is
certainly simple, but we doubt
whether it would satisfy any respectable
schoolboy. Unfortunately for
such as he, there is no rule of three
by which social problems may be
solved. Race, climate, soil, political
organization, and many other causes,
working through ever-varying combinations,
must all be considered if
we would understand the history
of material progress. As labor is
the most fruitful cause of wealth,
there is a necessary relation between
national wealth and national
habits, which are the outcome of
a thousand influences, one of the
most powerful of which undoubtedly
is religious faith. But who does
not know that climate influences
labor, not only by enervating or invigorating
the laborer, but also by
the effect it produces on the regularity
of his habits? If the Italian
loves the <i lang="it">dolce far niente</i>, while
the New Englander makes haste
to grow rich as though some
demon whom gold could bribe
pursued him, shall we find the
secret of their peculiar characters
in their religious faith or in the
climate in which they live, or shall
we not rather seek it in a combination
of causes, physical and moral?
We have assuredly no thought of
denying the intimate connection
which exists between faith and
character or between a nation’s religion
and its civilization. We
are willing even to affirm that
not only the general superiority of
Christian nations, but their superior
wealth also, is in great measure
attributable to their religion. And
now, bidding adieu to M. de Laveleye
for a while, we propose to discuss
this subject, to which we have
already alluded, somewhat more
fully.</p>

<p>Christianity certainly does not
measure either the greatness or the
happiness of a people by its wealth,
nor does it take as its ideal that
state of society in which “the millionaire
is the one sole god” and
commerce is all in all; in which
“only the ledger lives, and only not
all men lie.”</p>

<p>Whether we consider individuals
or associations of men, the Catholic
Church does not hold and cannot
hold that material interests are
the highest. To be noble, to be
true, to be humble, to be pure, is,
in her view, better than to be rich.
Man is more than money, which is
good only in so far as it serves to
develop his higher nature.</p>

<p>“The whole aim of man is to be
happy,” says Bossuet. “Place happiness
where it ought to be, and it is
the source of all good; but the
source of all evil is to place it where
it ought not to be.”</p>

<p>“It is evident,” says S. Thomas,
“that the happiness of man cannot
lie in riches. Wealth is sought after
only as a support of human life. It
cannot be the end of man; on the
contrary, man is its end.…
The longing, moreover, for the highest
good is infinite. The more it is
possessed, the more it is loved and
the more all else is despised; for
the more it is possessed, the better is
it known. With riches this is not
the case. No sooner are they ours
than they are despised, or used as
means to some other end; and this,
as it shows their imperfect nature,
is proof that in them the highest
good is not to be found.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span></p>

<p>If wealth is not the highest good
of individuals, is it of nations?
What is the ideal of society? The
study of the laws which govern
national life must necessarily begin
with this question, which all
who have dealt with the subject,
from Plato to Comte and Mill, have
sought to answer. It is manifest
that each one’s attempt to solve
this problem will be based upon his
views on the previous question:
What is the ideal of man? This, in
turn, will be answered according to
each one’s notions of the ideal of
God; and here we have the secret
of the phenomenon which so surprised
Proudhon&mdash;the necessary
connection between religion and
society, theology and politics.</p>

<p>Is there a God, personal, distinct
from nature? Or is nature the only
god, and science her prophet? It
is right here at this central point
that men are dividing; it is here we
must place ourselves, if we would
view the two great armies that in all
Christendom are gathering for a supreme
conflict.</p>

<p>There is a form of infidelity in
our day&mdash;and it is the one into
which all unbelief must ultimately
resolve itself&mdash;which starts with this
assumption: “Whether or not there
is a God must for ever remain unknown
to man.” It reasons in this
way: “This whole subject belongs
within the region, not only of the
unknown, but of the unknowable.
It is an insoluble riddle, and the
philosophies and theologies which
have sought to unravel it, if only
idle, might deserve nothing more
than contempt; but they have been
the bane of human thought, have
soured all the sweetness of life,
and therefore ought to be visited
with the execration of mankind.
Since religion is a subject about
which nothing can be known, what
is so absurd as to spend time upon
it? What so absurd as to divert the
thoughts of men from subjects in
which thinking is fruitful to those
in which it must for ever remain
barren of all except evil results?
What so absurd as to set them working
for a future life, of which we
can never know whether it exists at
all, when we might at least teach
them how to make the present one
worth having? The paradise of the
future, which the prophetic eye of
science can already descry, is <em>in</em> the
world, not <em>beyond</em> it; and to seek to
hasten its approach is the highest
and only worthy object in life.” As
we take it, this is the creed of modern
unbelief, to which as yet few will
openly subscribe, but toward which
all its hundred conflicting schools of
thought are moving. Few men indeed
are able to perceive the logical
outcome of their opinions, and
still fewer have the courage to confess
what they more than half suspect.</p>

<p>This superstition is a return to the
nature-worship of paganism, but
under a different aspect. Of old,
nature was worshipped as revealed
to sense, and now as revealed
to thought; then as beautiful,
now as true or useful. The
first was artistic, and form was its
symbol; the last is scientific, and
law is its expression. The religion
of humanity is only a phase of this
worship; for in it man is considered,
not as the child of God, but as the
product of nature.</p>

<p>And now what has this to do
with the ideal of society or the
wealth of nations? At the basis
of all social organization lies morality,
as it is by conduct that both
individuals and nations are saved
or lost. The history of the human
race shows that religion and morality
are intimately related. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[587]</a></span>
there have been good atheists does
not affect the truth of this proposition
any more than that there have
been bad Christians. Men are
usually better or worse than their
principles; practice and profession
rarely accord; and this is remarked
because it ought not to exist.</p>

<p>Conduct, to be rational, should be
motived, and consequently referable
to certain general principles by
which it is justified. To be particular,
a man who believes in God,
the Creator, a Father as just as he
is good, has fundamental motives
of action which are wanting to the
atheist. The one should seek to
approve himself to his heavenly
Father; the other cannot go farther
than conform to the laws of nature.
To the one this life, as compared
with that which is to be, is of value
only as it relates to it; to the other
it is all in all. And since the ultimate
end of society is the welfare
of the associated, the one will regard
this end from a transcendental
point of view, taking in time
and eternity; the other will consider
it merely with reference to man’s
present state. Their notions of
life, of its ends, aims, and proper
surroundings, will be radically different.</p>

<p>Suppose for a moment that religious
beliefs are mere dreams, fancies
of sick brains; is it not at once
manifest that human life is a much
poorer and sorrier thing than it is
commonly thought to be? As the
light of heaven fades away, do not
all things grow dark, leaving us in
the shadow of death, despairing or
debauched, sullen or frantic? The
poet’s dream, the mother’s fond
hope, the heart’s deep yearning, the
mind’s flight towards the infinite, all
become flat, meaningless, and unprofitable.
Men are simply animals
chained to this clod, too happy
if the heaven-seeking eye permitted
them to see it alone. Trouble,
danger, and physical pain are the
only evils, and virtue is the sharp-sighted
prudence which enables us
to avoid them. Self-denial is not
only useless, it is irrational. Our
appetites are good and ought to be
indulged. Nothing, of its own nature,
is sinful; excess alone is wrong;
all indulgence, provided it hurt no
one, is good&mdash;nay, it is necessary.
Whoever denies any one of his appetites
the food it craves cripples
himself, is maimed and incomplete.
“He may be a monk; he may be
a saint; but a man he is not.”</p>

<p>When these views are transferred
to questions of political economy
and social organization, they lead
to materialistic and utilitarian theories.
Society must be organized
on the basis of positivism; the
problem of the future is how to
give to the greatest number of individuals
the best opportunities of
indulgence, the greatest amount of
comfort, with the least amount of
pain. This is the greatest-happiness
principle of Bentham and
Mill. Culture, of course, intellectual
and æsthetic, as affording the
purest pleasure, must form a feature
of this society; but its distinctive
characteristic is wealth, which is
both the means and the opportunity
of indulgence.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We constantly hear of the evils of
wealth,” says Buckle, “and of the sinfulness
of loving money; although it is
certain that, after the love of knowledge,
there is no one passion which has done
so much good to mankind as the love of
money.”</p>

<p>“If we open our eyes,” says Strauss,<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
“and are honest enough to avow what
they show us, we must acknowledge
that the entire activity and aspiration of
the civilized nations of our time is based
on views of life which run directly counter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[588]</a></span>
to those entertained by Christ. The
ratio of value between the here and the
hereafter is exactly reversed; and this
is by no means the result of the merely
luxurious and so-called materialistic tendencies
of our age, nor even of its marvellous
progress in technical and industrial
improvements.… All that is best
and happiest which has been achieved by
us has been attainable only on the basis
of a conception which regarded this present
world as by no means despicable,
but rather as man’s proper field of labor,
as the sum total of the aims to which his
efforts should be directed. If, from the
force of habit, a certain proportion of
workers in this field still carry the belief
in an hereafter along with them, it is nevertheless
a mere shadow, which attends
their footsteps without exercising any
determining influence on their actions.”</p>

</div>

<p>This is the cosmic religion, which
is preached as “the new faith,
the religion of the future.” This
world is all in all&mdash;let us make the
most of it; or, as the pagans of old
put it: “Let us eat and drink, for
to-morrow we die.”</p>

<p>In its essence it is sensualism; in
its manifestations it will be refined
or coarse, according to the dispositions
of the persons by whom it is
accepted. Now its worship will be
accompanied with music and song
and dance; at other times it will
sink to those orgies in which man
becomes only an unnatural animal.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to the Christian
religion, and consider its teachings
in their bearing upon the subject
we are discussing. They are the
very opposite of those which we
have just read, and proceed from
principles which are in direct contradiction
to the cosmic philosophy.
God is the highest, the Creator of
all things, which are of value only
as they relate to him and are in
harmony with the laws of his being.
The earth is but the threshold of
heaven or of hell, as the case may
be. This life is a preparation for a
future one, which is eternal; and all
human interests, whether individual
or social, to be rightly understood,
must be viewed in their relation to
this truth. Man is essentially a
moral being, and duty, which is
often in conflict with pleasure, is his
supreme law. He is under the action
of antagonistic forces; seeing
the better and approving it, he is
drawn to love the worse and to do
it. Thus self-denial becomes the
condition of virtue, and warfare
with himself his only assurance of
victory.</p>

<p>“But he said to all: If any one
wishes to come after me, let him
deny himself, take up his cross
every day, and follow me.”</p>

<p>Wealth, which is the world’s great
slave and idol, and universal procurator
of the senses, though in itself
not evil, is yet a hindrance to
the highest spiritual life. “If thou
wouldst be perfect, go sell what
thou hast, and give it to the poor,
and thou shall have treasure in
heaven: and come and follow me.”</p>

<p>As duty is the supreme law of the
individual, it follows that we must
seek the ideal of society in the
moral order, to which all other
social interests should be made
subservient, or else they will beget
only an unbounded and lawless
activity. Even education is valuable
only in so far as it gives man a
deeper sense of his responsibility to
God, and enables him more thoroughly
to understand and perform
his duty.</p>

<p>The social problem as between
Christianity and modern paganism
may be stated in this way: is it the
end of society to grow strong in
virtue through self-denial, or to increase
indefinitely the means and
opportunity of indulgence? On
which side is progress, on which
decline?</p>

<p>We cannot now go farther into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[589]</a></span>
this subject, but before leaving it we
wish to quote the words of Fitzjames
Stephen, who will hardly be called
a Christian, on modern progress.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I suspect,” he says,<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> “that in many
ways it has been a progress from strength
to weakness; that people are more sensitive,
less enterprising and ambitious,
less earnestly desirous to get what they
want, and more afraid of pain, both for
themselves and others, than they used to
be. If this should be so, it appears to
me that all other gains, whether in wealth,
knowledge, or humanity, afford no equivalent.
Strength, in all its forms, is life and
manhood. To be less strong is to be
less a man, whatever else you may be.
This suspicion prevents me, for one, from
feeling any enthusiasm about progress,
but I do not undertake to say it is well
founded.… I do not myself see
that our mechanical inventions have increased
the general vigor of men’s characters,
though they have no doubt increased
enormously our control over nature.
The greater part of our humanity appears
to me to be a mere increase of nervous
sensibility in which I feel no satisfaction
at all.”</p>

</div>

<p>The general superiority, and even
the greater wealth, of Christian nations
as compared with others we
would attribute, in great part at
least, to the influence of their religious
faith, to which they owe their
sentiments on the dignity and sacredness
of human nature in itself,
apart from surroundings; on the
substantial equality of all men before
God, which tends to produce
as its counterpart the equality of
all before the law, thus leading to
the abolition of slavery, the elevation
of woman, and the protection
of childhood. To it also they owe
their ideas on the family, which, in
its constitutive Christian elements,
lies at the very foundation of our
civilization. To Christianity they
owe the principles of universal
charity and compassion, which have
revolutionized the relations of social
life; and, finally, to it they are
indebted for the rehabilitation of
labor, the chief source of wealth,
which the pagan nations looked
upon as degrading.</p>

<p>“I cannot say,” writes Herodotus,
“whether the Greeks get their
contempt for labor from the Egyptians;
for I find the same prejudice
among the Thracians, the Scythians,
the Persians, and the Lydians.”</p>

<p>“The Germans,” says Tacitus,
“cannot bear to remain quiet, but
they love to be idle; they hold it
base and unworthy of them to acquire
by their sweat what they
can purchase with their blood.”
In the same way the Gauls looked
upon labor with contempt.</p>

<p>We shall have to take up M. de
Laveleye’s pamphlet again; for the
present we lay it aside with the following
remark: If we should grant,
to the fullest, all that is here said
about the greater wealth and material
prosperity of Protestant as compared
with Catholic nations what
are we thence to conclude? Shall
we say that the greed of gain which
is so marked a feature in the populations
of England and the United
States is at once the result and proof
of true Christian faith? May it
not be barely possible that the value
of material progress is exaggerated?
Is there not danger lest, when
man shall have made matter the
willing slave of all his passions, he
should find that he has become the
creature of this slave? However
this may be, might not a Catholic
find some consolation in the words
of Holy Writ?</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And the angel that spoke in me, said
to me: Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the
Lord of hosts: I am zealous for Jerusalem
and Sion with a great zeal. <em>And I
am angry with a great anger with the
nations that are rich</em>; for I was angry a
little, but they helped forward the evil.”</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE BARONET IS RELIEVED.&mdash;A CASE OF MISTAKEN IDENTITY.</span></h4>

<p>The night was wild and stormy.
The wind had risen to a hurricane,
and drove the rain in Raymond’s face
as he walked home through the park.
It was driving the grass in cold ripples
over the fields, and tossing the
trees about as if it would break
them. Columns of black clouds
were trooping over the sky, and the
moon broke through them as if she
were pursued by the wind and flying
for her life. Raymond was a long
time getting to the cottage. Great
gusts swept up from the valley,
staggering him, so that he had to
stand every now and then and cling
to a tree until it passed. Then the
rain beat against his face so that he
could hardly profit by the fitful
gleams of the moon as she dipped
in and out of the clouds. He was
dripping wet when he got to his own
door and let himself in with his
latch-key. He took off his coat,
hanging it in the hall, and lighted
his candle. Franceline had left it
close to his hand with a match.</p>

<p>Mechanically he walked up to his
room and began to divest himself
of his drenched clothing. He hardly
noticed that they were soaking
and that he was wet through; he
was flushed and heated as if he had
come straight from a hot room.
How the blast roared and shrieked,
beating against the cottage till it
rocked like a ship at sea, and trying
the windows till they cracked and
groaned! It whistled through the
chinks so that the flimsy red
curtain fluttered as if the window
had been open. Raymond pushed
it aside and opened the shutters,
and looked out. The night was
inky black, above and below, except
when a star flickered in and out like
a gas-jet swept by the wind, and
showed the river like a bit of steel,
as it flashed and quivered under the
pelting rain and hurried away into
blacker distance. All this angry
roar was better than music to Raymond.
The fury of the elements
seemed to comfort him. Nature
was in sympathy with him. It was
kind of her to be angry and disturbed
when he was so distraught.
Nature had more heart than his
fellow-men. These were talking
over his despair quietly enough
now&mdash;mocking him, very likely; but
the world around was shaken, and
tossed, and driven in sympathy with
him. A great gust came swelling
up from the river, growing louder
and heavier as it drew near, till,
gathering itself up like a mountainous
wave, it burst with a crash
against the cottage. M. de la
Bourbonias leaped back, and, with a
sudden impulse of terror, flew out
into the landing, and knocked at
Angélique’s door; but the sonorous
breathing of the old servant reassured
him that all was right there
and in the room beyond. It was
pitch dark, but the reflection from
his own open door showed Franceline’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[591]</a></span>
standing wide open. He
listened, but everything was silent
there. He stole noiselessly back to
his room and closed the door, without
disturbing either of the sleepers.</p>

<p>The storm had reached its crisis,
and gradually subsided after this,
until the wind was spent and died
away in long, low wails behind the
woods, and the moon drifted above
the tattered clouds that were sweeping
toward the east, leaving a
portion of the sky stainless, with
stars flashing out brightly. Raymond
put out his candle and went
to bed.</p>

<p>Under ordinary circumstances he
would probably have paid for the
night’s adventure by an attack of
bronchitis or rheumatic fever; but
the mental fever that had been
devouring him warded off every
other, and when he came down
next morning he was neither ill nor
ailing.</p>

<p>Franceline, like her <i lang="fr">bonne</i>, had
slept through the storm, and they
were quite astonished to hear what
an awful night it had been, and to
see the fields strewn with great
branches in every direction, gates
torn up, and other evidences of
the night’s work. But they saw
no traces of another tempest that
was raging still in a human soul
close by them. Nothing betrayed
its existence, and they guessed
nothing&mdash;so securely does this living
wall of flesh screen the secrets
of the spirit from every outside gaze!
Passions rise up in hearts whose
pulses we fondly imagine close and
familiar to us as our own, and the
winds blow and the waves run high
and make wild havoc there, turning
life into darkness and despair, or, at
the whisper of the Master’s voice,
illuminating it as suddenly with a
flood of sunshine; and we are blind
and deaf to these things, and remain
as “a stranger to our brother.” And
mercifully so. Many a battle is
won that would have been lost if it
had not been fought alone. We
hinder each other by our pity, perhaps,
as often as we help.</p>

<p class="break">Sir Simon had very little appetite
for his breakfast when he came
down next morning, sick at heart
after a sleepless night, and found
the pleasant meal thoughtfully
spread in his favorite room, the
library, with the table wheeled
close to his arm-chair on the
right side of the hearth. It all
looked the very picture of comfort
and refinement and elegance. But
the cup was doubly poisoned to him
now; last night’s adventure had added
the last drop of bitterness to it.
He could not think of Raymond
without a poignant pang. He
suspected&mdash;and he was right&mdash;that
Raymond was thinking of him, wondering
whether it was really all over
with him this time, and whether he
was bankrupt and his estate in the
fangs of the creditors; and whether
he was driving away from the
Court never to see it again; or
whether once more, for the hundred
and ninety-ninth time, he had weathered
the storm and was still afloat&mdash;even
though on a raft. Raymond
would have scarcely believed
it if any one had informed him that
he had been the instrument of destroying
Sir Simon’s one chance of
escape; that he had snatched the
last plank from him in his shipwreck.
It may have been an imaginary
one, and Sir Simon, after the
fashion of drowning men, may have
been catching at a straw; but now
that it was snatched from him, he
was more than ever convinced that
it had been a solid plank which
would have borne him securely to
shore. He did not ask himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[592]</a></span>
whether Mr. Plover would have
entered into his plans, and whether,
supposing he found it his interest
to do so, his fortune would have
been equal to the demand; he only
considered what might have been,
and what was not; and thinking of
this, his indulgent pity for M. de la
Bourbonais shrank in the bitter reflection
that he had ruined not
only himself but his friend irretrievably.
They were pretty much in
the same boat now.</p>

<p>Sir Simon’s self-made delusions
had cleared away wonderfully within
the last forty-eight hours. He
drew no comparison to his own advantage
between Raymond’s actual
position and his own. If M. de la
Bourbonais was a thief in the technical
sense of the word, he, Sir Simon,
was a bankrupt; and a bankrupt,
under certain conditions, may
mean a swindler. He had been a
swindler for years; his life had been
a sham these twenty years, and he
had not the excuse of circumstances
to fall back on; he had been
dishonest from extravagance and
sheer want of principle. “Take it
first and afford it afterwards” had
been his theory, and he had lived
up to it, and now the day of reckoning
had arrived. Many a time
he had said, half in jest, that Raymond
was the richer man of the
two. Raymond used to laugh
mildly at the notion, but it was true.
An ambitious, extravagant man and
a contented poor one are pretty
much on a level: the one possesses
everything he does not want; the
other wants everything he does not
possess. The unprincipled spend-thrift
and the high-minded, struggling
man were then on an equality
of fortune, or rather the latter was
virtually the wealthier of the two.
But now the distinction was washed
out. The proud consciousness of
unstained honor and innermost self-respect
which had hitherto sustained
M. de la Bourbonais and sweetened
the cup of poverty to him was gone.
He was a blighted man, who could
never hold up his head again
amongst his fellow-men.</p>

<p>“Good God! what delirium
possessed him? How could he be
so infatuated, so stupid!” broke
out Sir Simon, giving vent to what
was passing through his mind.
“But,” he added presently, “he
was not accountable. I believe
grief and anxiety drove him mad.”
Then he recalled that answer of
Raymond’s, that had sounded so untrue
at the time: “Yes, I can fancy
myself giving way, if the temptation
took a certain form, and if
I were left to my own strength.”
The words sounded now like a prophecy.</p>

<p>Of course we all know that, according
to the canons of poetical
justice, the brave, suffering man
should have been in some unexpected
way succored in his extremity;
that some angel in visible or
invisible form should have been
sent to hold him up from slipping
into the pit that despair had dug
for him; and that, on the other
hand, the wicked spendthrift should
have been left to eat the bread of
righteous retribution, and suffer the
just penalty of his evil behavior.
But poetical justice and the facts
of real life do not always agree.</p>

<p>Sir Simon, after walking up and
down the library, chewing the cud
of bitter thoughts until he was sick
of it, bethought himself that as
breakfast was there he might as
well try and eat it before it got
cold. So he sat down and poured
out his coffee, and then, by mere
force of habit, and without the
faintest glimmer of interest, began
to turn over the bundle of letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[593]</a></span>
piled up beside the <cite>Times</cite> on
the table. One after another was
tossed away contemptuously. The
duns might cry till they were hoarse
now; he need not trouble about
them; he would be at least that
much the gainer by his disgrace.
Suddenly his eye lighted on an envelope
that was not addressed in
the well-known hand of the race of
duns, but in Clide de Winton’s,
and it bore the London postmark.
The thought of Clide generally produced
on Sir Simon the effect of a
needle run through the left side;
but he took up this letter with a
strange thrill of expectation. He
opened it, and a change came over
his face; it was not joy&mdash;it was too
uncertain, too tremulous yet for
that. He must read it again before
he trusted to the first impression;
he must make sure that he was not
dreaming, and the words that danced
like a will-o’-the-wisp before
his eyes were real, written with real
ink, on real paper. At last he dropped
the letter, and a heartier prayer
than he had uttered since his
childhood came from him: “My
God, I thank thee! I have not deserved
this mercy, but I will try
to deserve it.”</p>

<p>He buried his face in his hands,
and remained mute and motionless
for some minutes. Then, starting
up as if suddenly remembering
something, he pulled out his watch.
It wanted five minutes of ten. The
law officer and the Jew creditor were
to start by the train that left Charing
Cross at a quarter past eleven. Sir
Simon rang the bell sharply.</p>

<p>“Saddle a horse, and ride as fast
as you can with this to the telegraph,”
he said to his valet, who
answered the summons; “and the
moment you come back, get ready
to be off with me to London by the
mid-day train.”</p>

<p>The telegram prepared Mr. Simpson
to see his client appear at his
office at two o’clock that afternoon,
and, in obedience to its directions,
the Jew was there to meet him.
Clide de Winton had seen Simpson
the day before, and given him full
authority to settle the Dullerton
debts so as to set Sir Simon Harness
free. He had only arrived in
London that very morning, and it
was the merest accident that led
him to call on the family lawyer,
who was also the family’s best
friend, on his way from the station
to his hotel. Simpson was discretion
itself, and one of the attributes
of that virtue is to know when to
be indiscreet. Clide’s first inquiry
was for Sir Simon, with a view&mdash;which
the astute lawyer did not see
through&mdash;of leading up to inquiries
about other friends at Dullerton;
whereupon Mr. Simpson bolted out
the whole truth, told him of the baronet’s
position, the long arrears of
debt that had come against him, and
which were to culminate in bankruptcy
within twenty-four hours.
It was as if the sky had fallen on
Clide, or the ground opened under
his feet.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness I am come in
time!” he exclaimed; and there and
then sat down and wrote to Sir Simon,
telling him that proceedings
were stopped, and that he, Clide,
took them in his own hands.</p>

<p>“And this is what you call being
a friend!” said the young man, as
he and the baronet left Simpson’s
office together, the one with a lightened
purse, the other with a heart
considerably more so. “To think of
your letting things go to such
lengths, and that if I had been a
day later it would have been all
over!”</p>

<p>“My dear boy! what can I say to
you? How can I ever repay you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span></p>

<p>“By forgiving me. I’ve lived
long enough to find out a secret or
two. One is that it requires a very
noble soul to forgive a man a money
obligation, and that there is a deal
more generosity in accepting than
in conferring it. So if you don’t
pick a quarrel with me after this,
and turn your back on me, we are
quits. Is it a bargain?”</p>

<p>He held out his hand, laughing;
Sir Simon wrung it till the pressure
made Clide wince. This was his
only answer, and the only sentimental
passage the occasion gave
rise to between them.</p>

<p class="break">It was more than a month since
Clide had left St. Petersburg, although
the season was still at its
height there, and Isabel’s engagement
was to have lasted until the
end of it. This had, however, been
brought to an abrupt and tragic
close. She had acted for six weeks
with unprecedented success; every
night was a fresh triumph, and
nothing was talked of in the <i lang="fr">salons</i>
and clubs but the wonders of her
voice, the intense reality of her
acting, and her rare beauty. Ophelia
was considered her grandest
part. She was playing it one evening
to a crowded house, in the
presence of the imperial family
and the whole court, and seemed
wrought up to a pitch of power and
pathos that surpassed her finest
preceding efforts. She was singing
the mad scene with melting tenderness;
the house was breathless,
hanging enraptured on every note,
when suddenly the voice ceased,
the prima donna cast a wild look
on every side of her, and then,
with a shriek too terribly real to be
within the compass of art, she flung
her arms over her head, and, clasping
her hands, fell insensible to the
ground. Never did any opera-house
witness so dramatic a scene.
The spectators rose in a body from
the pit to the gallery, shouting to
know what had happened, and calling
for help. Help was near
enough. A man in plain clothes
sprang from behind the scenes, and
lifted the prostrate Ophelia before
any of the actors could interfere.
There were several medical men
among the audience, and they rushed
in a body to offer their services.
It was feared for a moment that
she was dead; but the doctors soon
pronounced it to be only a swoon,
though it was impossible to say
what might follow on the awakening.
The emperor sent one of his
chamberlains to hear and see what
was going on in the green-room, and
inquire if the piece was to be continued;
whereupon the luckless
manager flew out before the footlights,
and falling on his knees under
the imperial box, as if he saw the
knout suspended over his shoulders,
called heaven to witness that he
was a loyal subject and an innocent
man, and flung himself on the imperial
clemency. The prima donna
had been seized with illness, and
the opera could not be finished that
night. The czar waved his clemency
to the terrified man, who withdrew,
invoking all manner of benedictions
on the mercy of the Father
of all the Russians, and flew to hear
what the doctors were now saying of
Ophelia. They were saying that
she was acting out her part as it
had never yet been acted, with the
perfection of nature&mdash;she was raving
mad.</p>

<p>This was not proclaimed at once.
The affair was hushed up for a few
days, and kept out of the newspapers,
so that Clide only heard it
accidentally at the club, where he
happened to lounge in a week after
the occurrence. He sent Stanton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[595]</a></span>
off at once to make inquiries at the
house where Isabel lodged. But they
could tell nothing of her there; she
had been taken away the day after
her seizure at the opera, and had
left no address. Clide went straight
to the lawyer, and asked if there was
no way of getting access to her
through the police; of learning at
least whether she was in an asylum;
for his first idea on hearing that she
had been taken away was that they
had placed her in some such confinement.
The lawyer agreed with
him that this was most probable,
but did not promise much help
in verifying the supposition. He
seemed honestly willing to do what
he could in the matter, but repeated
the old warning that little could
be done where imperial favor stood
in the way. It was highly probable
that the czar would still show his
benevolence toward the beautiful
artist by screening her hiding-place
and the fact of her being mad, in
hope of her being able to return
and complete her engagement after
rest and medical treatment.</p>

<p>His position now seemed worse
to Clide than it had ever been.
The thought of Isabel’s being in a
mad-house, a prey to the most awful
visitation that humanity is subject
to, rudely, perhaps cruelly,
treated by coarse, pitiless menials,
was so horrible that at first it
haunted him till he almost fancied
he was going mad himself. The
image of the bright young creature
who had first stirred the pulses of
his foolish heart was for ever before
his eyes as she appeared to him
that day&mdash;how long ago it seemed!&mdash;in
the midst of the splendors of
Niagara, and that he took her for a
sprite&mdash;some lovely creature of the
water and the sunlight. He remembered,
with a new sense of its
meaning, the strange air she wore,
walking on as if half unconscious
he had wondered if she were not
walking in her sleep. Was it a
phase of the cruel malady that was
then showing itself? And if so,
was she not, perhaps, blameless from
the beginning? This blight that
had fallen on her in her brilliant
maturity might have been germinating
then, making strange havoc
in her mind, and impelling her
character, her destiny, to fearful
and fantastic issues. Some weeks
passed while Clide was a prey to
these harrowing thoughts, when he
received a letter from the lawyer,
saying he had something to communicate
to him of interest.</p>

<p>“It is not good news,” he said,
as the Englishman entered his office;
“but it is better than complete
suspense. The signora is not
in St. Petersburg. All our researches
were useless from the
first, as she was carried off almost
immediately to a lunatic asylum in
Saxony.”</p>

<p>“And she is there still?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and she has been admirably
treated with the utmost skill
and care, so much so that it is expected
she will be quite restored
after a short period of convalescence.”</p>

<p>“How did you ascertain all
this?” inquired Clide.</p>

<p>“Through a client of mine who
has been for some time a patient
of the establishment. He left it
very recently, and came to see me
on his return, and in talking over
the place and its inmates he described
one in a way that excited
my suspicions. I wrote to the director,
and put a few questions cautiously,
and the answer leaves me
no doubt but that the patient whom
my client saw there a few days before
his departure was the lady who
interests you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[596]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did you hear who accompanied
her to Saxony?”</p>

<p>“My client saw a person walking
in the grounds with her once, and
from the description it must be the
same who travelled with her from
England&mdash;her uncle, in fact: a
middle-sized man with coal-black
hair and very white teeth; ‘decidedly
an unpleasant-looking person’
my client called him.”</p>

<p>“Strange!” murmured Clide.
“That description does not tally
with my recollection of the man
who called himself her uncle, except
that he had a forbidding countenance
and was of medium height.
He had a quantity of gray, almost
white, hair, and not a sound tooth
in his head.”</p>

<p>“Humph! White hair may turn
black, and new teeth may be made
to replace lost ones,” observed the
lawyer. “I would not be put off
the scent by changes of that sort,
if the main points coincided.”</p>

<p>“Very true. I must start at once,
then, for Saxony, and try and see
for myself. I shall have difficulty
in gaining the confidence of the directors
of the place, I dare say.
Can you help me by a letter of introduction
to any of them?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I am well known to the
principal medical man by name,
and I will give you a line to him
with pleasure.”</p>

<p>He wrote it, and shook hands
with his client and wished him
good-speed.</p>

<p>Clide travelled without halting
till he drove up to the door of the
asylum. His letter procured him
admittance at once to the private
room of the medical man, and,
what was of greater importance, it
inclined the latter to credit his
otherwise almost incredible story.
When Clide had told all he deemed
necessary, the doctor informed
him that the patient whom he believed
to be his wife had already
left the house and the country altogether;
she had spent three full
weeks under his care, and was then
well enough to be removed, and
had, by his advice, been taken
home for the benefit of native air.
It was just three days since she
had left Saxony. The doctor could
give no idea as to where she had
gone, beyond that she had returned
to England; he knew nothing of
the whereabouts of her native place
there, and her uncle had left no
clue to his future residence.</p>

<p>Clide was once more baffled by
fate, and found himself again in a
dead-lock. In answer to his inquiries
concerning the nature of
Isabel’s disease, the medical man
said that it was hereditary, and
therefore beyond the likelihood&mdash;not
to say possibility&mdash;of radical
cure. This, it seemed, was the third
attack from which she had suffered.
The first was in early girlhood, before
the patient was eighteen; the
second, somewhat later and of
much longer duration&mdash;it had
lasted six years, her uncle said;
then came the third crisis, which,
owing, perhaps, to the improved
general health of the patient, but
more probably to the more judicious
and enlightened treatment
she had met with, had passed off
very rapidly. It was, however, far
from being a cure. It was at best
but a recovery, and the disease
might at any moment show itself
again in a more obstinate and dangerous
form. Perfect quiet, freedom
from excitement, whether mental
or physical, were indispensable
conditions for preserving her against
another crisis. It was needless to
add after this that the career of an
actress was the most fatal one the
unfortunate young woman could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[597]</a></span>
have adopted. But in that, no
doubt, she was more passive than
active.</p>

<p class="break">With this new light on his path,
Clide hastened his return to England,
farther than ever, it seemed,
from his journey’s end, and laden
with a heavier burden than when
he set out. March! march! was
still the command that sounded in
his ears, driving him on and on like
the Wandering Jew, and never letting
him get nearer the goal.</p>

<p>He had not the faintest idea of
Isabel’s native place. She had told
him she was Scotch, and her name
said so too, though she was perfectly
free from the native accent
which marked her uncle’s speech
so strongly. But what did that
prove either way? Was Cameron
her name, or Prendergast his? He
had taken a new name in his travels,
and so had she. Still, feeble as the
thread was, it was the only one he
had to guide him; so he started for
Scotland as soon as he landed in
England, having previously taken
the precaution to acquaint the police
in London with his present
purpose, and what had led him to
it. If Isabel were sufficiently recovered
to appear again in public,
it was probable that the brutal man&mdash;who
was in reality no more than
her task-master&mdash;would have made
some engagement for her with a
manager, and she might at this
moment be singing her brain away
for his benefit in some provincial
theatre. It was clear he shunned
the publicity of the London stage.
Clide thought of these things as he
tramped over the purple heather of
the Highlands, following now one
mirage, now another; and his heart
swelled within him and smote him
for his angry and vindictive feelings
toward Isabel; and tears, that
were no disgrace to his manhood,
forced themselves from his eyes.
Poor child! She was not to blame,
then, for wrecking his life, and
coming again like an evil genius to
thrust him back into the abyss just
as he had climbed to safety, beckoned
onwards and upwards by another
angel form. She was a victim
herself, and had perhaps never meant
to deceive or betray him, but had
loved him with her mad, untutored
heart as well as she knew how.</p>

<p>The winter days dragged on
drearily, as he went from place to
place in Scotland, and found no
trace of the missing one, heard
nothing that gave him any hopes
of finding her. The police were
equally unsuccessful in London.
Stanton had gone back there, very
much against his inclination; but
Clide insisted that he would be of
more use in the busy streets, keeping
his keen eyes open, than following
his master in his wanderings
up and down Scotland.</p>

<p>One dark afternoon the valet was
walking along Regent Street, when
he stopped to look at some prints
in a music-shop. The gas was
lighted, and streamed in a brilliant
blaze over the gaudily-attired tenors
and <i lang="it">prime donne</i> that were piling the
agony on the backs of various operatic
songs. Stanton was considering
them, and mentally commenting on
the manner of ladies and gentlemen
who found it good to spend their
lives making faces and throwing
themselves into contortions that
appeared to him equally painful and
ridiculous, when he noticed a lady
inside the shop engaged in choosing
some music. She was dressed
in black, and he only caught a
glimpse of her side face through her
veil; but the glimpse made him
start. He watched her take the
roll of music from the shopman, secure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[598]</a></span>
it in a little leathern case, and
then turn to leave the shop. She
walked out leisurely, but the moment
she opened the door she
quickened her pace almost to a
run; and before Stanton knew where
he was, she had rushed into the middle
of the street. He hastened
after her, but a string of carriages
and cabs intervened and blocked
the street for some moments. As
soon as it was clear, he saw the
slight figure in black stepping into
an omnibus. He hailed it, gesticulating
and hallooing frantically;
but the conductor, with the spirit
of contradiction peculiar to conductors,
kept his head persistently
turned the other way. Stanton tore
after him, waving his umbrella and
whistling, all to no purpose, until
at last he stopped for want of
breath. At the same moment the
omnibus pulled up to let some travellers
alight; he overtook it this
time, and got in. The great machine
went thundering on its way,
and there opposite to him sat the
lady in black, his master’s wife, he
was ready to swear, if she was in
the land of the living. He saw the
features very indistinctly, but well
enough to be certain of their identity;
the height and contour were
the same, and so was the mass of
jet black hair that escaped in thick
plaits from under the small black
bonnet. Then there was the conclusive
fact of his having seen her
in a music-shop. This clinched
the matter for Stanton. The omnibus
stopped, the lady got out, ran
to the corner of the street, and
waited for another to come up, and
jumped into it; Stanton meanwhile
following her like her shadow. She
saw it, and he saw that she saw it,
and that she was frightened and
trying to get away from him. Why
should she do so if she were not
afraid of being recognized? He
was not a gentleman, and could see
no reason for an unprotected young
woman being frightened at a man
looking fixedly at her and pursuing
her, unless she had a guilty conscience.
He sat as near as he could
to her in the omnibus, and when it
pulled up to let her down he got
down. She hurried up a small,
quiet street off Tottenham Court
Road, and on reaching a semi-detached
small house, flew up the
steps and pulled violently at the
bell. Stanton was beside her in
an instant.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, ma’am, but I know
you. I don’t mean to do you any
’arm, only to tell you that I’m
Stanton, Mr. Clide’s valet; you are
my master’s wife!”</p>

<p>He was excited, but respectful
in his manner.</p>

<p>“You are mistaken,” replied the
lady, shrinking into the doorway.
“I know nothing about you. I
never heard of Mr. Clide, and I’m
not married!”</p>

<p>Stanton was of course prepared
for the denial, and showed no sign
of surprise or incredulity; but, in
spite of himself, her tone of assurance
staggered him a little. He
could not say whether the sound of
the voice resembled that of Mrs.
de Winton. Its echoes had lingered
very faintly in his memory, and so
many other voices and sounds had
swept over it during the intervening
years that he could not the least
affirm whether the voice he had just
heard was hers or not. Before he
had found any answer to this question,
footsteps were audible pattering
on the tarpauling of the narrow
entry, and a slip-shod servant-girl
opened the door. The lady passed
quickly in; Stanton followed her.</p>

<p>“You must leave me!” she said,
turning on him. “This is my papa’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[599]</a></span>
house, and if you give any more
annoyance he will have you taken
into custody.” She spoke in a loud
voice, and as she ceased the parlor
door was opened, and a gentleman
in a velveteen coat and slippers
came forward with a newspaper
in his hand.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? What is all
this about?” he demanded blandly,
coming forward to reconnoitre
Stanton, who did not look at all
bland, but grim and resolute, like
a man who had conquered his footing
on the premises, and meant to
hold it.</p>

<p>“Sir, I am Stanton, Mr. Clide’s
valet; this lady knows me well, if
you don’t.”</p>

<p>“Papa! I never saw him in my
life! I don’t know who Mr. Clide
is!” protested the young lady in a
tremor. “This man has annoyed
me all the way home. Send him
away!”</p>

<p>“I must speak to you, sir,” said
Stanton stoutly. “I cannot leave
the house without.”</p>

<p>“Pray walk in!” said the gentleman,
waving his newspaper towards
the open parlor; “and you, my dear,
go and take off your bonnet.”</p>

<p>“Now, sir, be good enough to
state your business,” he began
when the door was closed.</p>

<p>“My business isn’t with you, sir,
but with your daughter, if she
is your daughter,” said Stanton.
“One thing is certain&mdash;she’s my
master’s wife; there an’t no use in
her denying it, and the best thing
she can do is to speak out to her
’usband penitent-like, and he’ll forgive
her, poor thing, and do the
best he can for her, which will
be better than what that uncle of
hers ’as been doin’ for her, draggin’
her about everywhere and driving
the poor creature crazy. That’s
what I’ve got to say, sir, and I
’ope you’ll see as it’s sense and
reason.”</p>

<p>The occupant of the velveteen
slippers listened to this speech with
eyes that grew rounder and rounder
as it proceeded; then he threw back
his head and laughed till the tears
ran down his cheeks.</p>

<p>“My good man, there’s some mistake!
You’ve mistaken my daughter
for somebody else; she never
was married in her life, and she has
no uncle that ever I heard of. Ha!
ha! ha! It’s the best joke I ever
heard in my life!”</p>

<p>“Excuse me; it an’t no joke at
all!” protested Stanton, nettled,
and resolved not to be shaken by
the ring of honesty there was in the
man’s laugh. “You mayn’t know
the person that calls himself her
uncle, but I do, sir. Mayhap you
are duped by the rascal yourself;
but it’ll all come out now. I have
it all in the palm of my hand.” And
he opened that capacious member
and closed it again significantly.
“Your daughter must either come
away with me quietly, or I’ll call
the police and have her taken off
whether she will or no!”</p>

<p>“I tell you, man, you are under
some preposterous mistake,” said the
gentleman, his blandness all gone,
and his choler rising. “My name
is Honey. I am a clerk in H&mdash;&mdash;
Bank, and my daughter, Eliza Jane
Honey, has never left me since
she was born. She is an artist,
a singer, and gives lessons in singing
in some of the first houses in
London!”</p>

<p>“Singer! Singing lessons! Ha!
Just so! I know it all,” said Stanton,
his mouth compressing itself
in a saturnine smile. “I know it
all, and I tell you I don’t leave this
’ouse without her.”</p>

<p>“Confound your insolence! What
do you mean? You’d better be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[600]</a></span>
gone this instant, or I’ll call the police
and give <em>you</em> into custody!</p>

<p>“No, sir, don’t try it; it won’t
answer,” said Stanton, imperturbable.
“It ’ud only make more trouble;
the poor thing has enough on
her already, and I’m not the one to
make more for her. If you call in
the police I’ve something ’ere,”
slapping his waistcoat pocket, “as
’ud settle at once which of us was
to be took up.”</p>

<p>Before Mr. Honey could say
anything in answer to this, a voice
came carrolling down the stairs,
singing some air from an opera,
rich with trills and <i lang="it">fioriture</i>.</p>

<p>“There it is! The very voice!
The very tune I’ve ’eard her sing
in the drawing-room at Lanwold!”
exclaimed Stanton.</p>

<p>The singer dashed into the room,
but broke off in her trills on seeing
him.</p>

<p>“What! you are not gone?
Papa, who is he?”</p>

<p>“My dear, he is either a madman
or&mdash;or worse,” said her father.
“It’s the most extraordinary thing
I ever heard in my life!”</p>

<p>“Speak out, ma’am, and don’t you
fear I’ll do you any ’arm; my master
wouldn’t ’ave it, not for all the
money he’s worth. Nobody knows
the sum he’s spent on them detectives
already to try and catch you;
and it speaks badly for the lot to
say they’ve not caught you long
ago. But don’t you be afraid of me,
ma’am!” urged Stanton, making his
voice as mild as he could.</p>

<p>Eliza Jane’s answer was a peal
of laughter.</p>

<p>“Why should I be afraid of you?
I never laid my eyes on you before,
or you on me; you mistake me for
somebody else, I tell you. I never
heard of Mr. Clide, and I am certain
he never heard of me. The
idea of your insisting that I’m his
wife!” And she laughed again; but
there was a nervous twitch about
her mouth, and Stanton saw it.</p>

<p>“As like as two peas in a pod!”
was his emphatic remark, as he deliberately
scanned her face.</p>

<p>There was no denying the resemblance,
indeed. The face was
fuller, the features more developed,
but the interval of years would explain
that.</p>

<p>“Look at my hand! You see I
have no wedding-ring? Ask me a
few questions; you will find out the
blunder at once, if you only try,”
she said.</p>

<p>Stanton paused for a moment, as
if trying to recall something that
might serve as a test.</p>

<p>“I ’ave it!” he said, looking up
with a look of triumph. “Open
your mouth, ma’am, and let me look
into it!”</p>

<p>He advanced towards her, expecting
instant compliance. But
Miss Honey rushed behind her
father with a cry of terror and disgust.
The movement was perfectly
natural under the circumstances,
but Stanton saw it in the light of
his own suspicions.</p>

<p>“Ha! I guessed as much,” he
said, drawing away, and speaking in
a quiet tone of regret. “I was
sure of it. Well, you give me no
choice. I know my dooty to a lady,
but I know my dooty to my master
too.” He went toward the window,
intending to throw it up and call for
a policeman.</p>

<p>“Stop!” cried Mr. Honey. “What
do you expect to find in my daughter’s
mouth?”</p>

<p>“That, sir, is known to her and
to me,” was the oracular reply.
“If she has nothing in it as can
convict her, she needn’t be afraid
to let me look into it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Honey turned aside, touched
his forehead with his forefinger, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[601]</a></span>
pointed with the thumb toward
Stanton. After this rapid and significant
little pantomime, he said
aloud to his daughter:</p>

<p>“My dear, perhaps it is as well
to let the man have his way. He
will see that there is nothing to see.
Come and gratify his singular curiosity.”</p>

<p>The girl was now too frightened
to see the ludicrous side of the performance;
she advanced gravely to
the table, on which a gas-burner
threw a strong, clear light, and opened
her mouth. Stanton came and
peered into it. “Please to lift the
left side as wide open as you can,
ma’am; it was the third tooth from
the back of her left jaw.”</p>

<p>She did as he desired, but, after
looking closely all round, he could
see nothing but two fine, pearly
rows of teeth, all ivory, without the
smallest glimmer of gold or silver
to attest the presence of even an
unsound one.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, ma’am!
I beg a thousand pardons, sir! I
find I’ve made a great mistake!
I’ve behaved shameful rude to you
and the young lady; but I hope
you’ll forgive me. I was only doing
my dooty to my master. I’m
sorrier than I can say for my mistake!”
Both father and daughter
were too thankful to be rid of him
to withhold their free and unconditional
pardon. They even went
the length of regretting that he had
had so much trouble and such an
unpleasant adventure all to no purpose,
and cordially wished him better
success next time, as he withdrew,
profusely apologizing.</p>

<p>“Papa, he must be an escaped
lunatic!” cried the young lady, as
the hall-door closed on Stanton.</p>

<p>“I dare say they took me for a
maniac, and indeed no wonder!”
was Stanton’s reflection, as he
heard a peal of laughter through
the window.</p>

<p>The adventure left, nevertheless,
an uneasy feeling on his mind, and
the next day he called on Mr.
Peckitt, the dentist, and related it.
Mr. Peckitt had not seen the wearer
of the silver tooth since the time
he had attended her before her departure
for Berlin; but he had seen
her uncle, and made an entire set
of false teeth for him. He took
the liberty on first seeing him of inquiring
for the young lady; but her
uncle answered curtly that she was
in no need of dental services at present,
and turned off the subject by
some irrelevant remark. Mr. Peckitt,
of course, took the hint, and never
reverted to it. This was all he
had to tell Stanton; but he did not
confirm the valet’s certainty as to
the non-identity of Miss Honey on
the grounds of the absence of the
silver tooth. It was, he thought,
improbable that his patient should
have parted with that odd appendage,
and that, if so, she should have
gone to a strange dentist to have it
replaced by an ordinary tooth; but
either of these alternatives was possible.</p>

<p>This was all the information that
Stanton had for his master when
the latter returned from his bootless
search in Scotland.</p>

<p>On the following day Sir Simon
Harness came to London and
heard of the strange adventure.
He was inclined to attach more
importance to it than Clide apparently
did.</p>

<p>“Suppose this so-called Eliza
Jane Honey should not have been
Isabel,” he said, “but some one
like her&mdash;the same whom you saw
at Dieppe?” Clide shook his
head.</p>

<p>“Impossible! <em>I</em> could not be
deceived, though Stanton might.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[602]</a></span>
This Miss Honey, too, was fuller in
the face, and altogether a more robust
person, than Isabel, as Stanton
remembers her. Now, after the terrible
attack that she has suffered
lately, it is much more likely that
she is worn and thin, poor child!”</p>

<p>“That is true. Still, there remains
the coincidence of the splendid
voice and of her being an artist.
If I were you, I would not
rest till I saw her myself.”</p>

<p>“It would only make assurance
doubly sure. Stanton has startled
me over and over again for nothing.
Every pair of black eyes and bright
complexion that he sees gives him
a turn, as he says, and sets him off
on the chase. No; the woman I
saw at Dieppe was my wife&mdash;I am
as sure of that as of my own identity.
I did not get near enough to
her to say, ‘Are you my wife?’ but
I am as certain of it as if I had.”
He promised, however, to satisfy
Sir Simon, that he would go to
Tottenham Court and see Miss
Honey.</p>

<p>While Clide’s tongue was engaged
on this absorbing topic, he was
mentally reverting to another subject
which was scarcely less absorbing,
and which was closer to his
heart. His love for Franceline
had not abated one atom of its ardor
since absence and a far more
impassable gulf had parted him from
her; her image reigned supreme in
his heart still, and accompanied
him in his waking and sleeping
thoughts. He felt no compunction
for this. His conscience tendered
full and unflinching allegiance to
the letter of the moral law, but it
was in bondage to none of those
finer spiritual tenets that ruled and
influenced Franceline. He would
have cut off his right hand rather
than outrage her memory by so
much as an unworthy thought; but
he gave his heart full freedom to
retain and foster its love for her.
He had not her clear spiritual insight
to discern the sinfulness of
this, any more than he had her deep
inward strength to enable him to
crush the sin out of his heart, even
if he had tried, which he did not.
It was his misfortune, not his fault,
that his love for her was unlawful.
Nothing could make it guilty; that
was in his own power, and the
purity of its object was its best protection.
She was an angel, and
could only be worshipped with the
reverent love that one of her own
pure kindred spirits might accept
without offence or contamination.
Such was Clide’s code, and, if he
wanted any internal proof of his
own loyalty to sanction it, he had it
in the shape of many deep-drawn
sighs&mdash;prayers, he called them, and
perhaps they were&mdash;that Franceline
might not suffer on his account,
but might forget him, and be happy
after a time with some worthier
husband. He had been quite honest
when he sighed these sighs&mdash;at
least he thought he was; yet when
Sir Simon, meaning to console him
and make things smooth and comfortable,
assured him emphatically
that they had been both happily
mistaken in the nature of Franceline’s
feelings, and then basely and
cruelly insinuated that Ponsonby
Anwyll was in a fair way to make
her a good husband by and by,
Clide felt a pang more acute than
any he had yet experienced. This
is often the case with us. We never
know how much insincerity there is
in the best of our prayers&mdash;the anti-self
ones&mdash;until we are threatened
with the grant of them.</p>

<p>Sir Simon said nothing about the
stolen ring. His friendship for
Raymond partook of that strong
personal feeling which made any
dishonor in its object touch him
like a personal stain. He could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[603]</a></span>
not bear even to admit it to himself
that his ideal was destroyed.
M. de la Bourbonais had been his
ideal of truth, of manly independence,
of everything that was noble,
simple, and good. There are many
intervals in the scale that separates
the ordinary honest man from the
ideal man of honor. Sir Simon
could count several of the former
class; but he knew but one of the
higher type. He had never known
any one whom he would have
placed on the same pinnacle of unsullied,
impregnable honor with
Raymond. Now that he had fallen,
it seemed as if the very stronghold
of Sir Simon’s own faith had
surrendered; he could disbelieve
everything, he could doubt everybody.
Where was truth to be
found, who was to be trusted, since
Raymond de la Bourbonais had
failed? But meantime he would
screen him as long as he could.
He would not be the first to speak
of his disgrace to any one. He
told Clide how Raymond had lost,
for him, a considerable sum of
money recently, through the dishonesty
of a bank, and how he had
borne the loss with the most incredible
philosophy, because just
then it so happened he did not
want the money; but since then
Franceline’s health had become
very delicate, and she was ordered
to a warm climate, and these few
hundreds would have enabled him
to take her there, and her father was
now bitterly lamenting the loss.</p>

<p>Clide was all excitement in a moment.</p>

<p>“But now you can supply them?”
he cried. “Or rather let me do it
through you! I must not, of
course, appear; but it will be
something to know I am of use to
her&mdash;to both of them. You can
easily manage it, can you not? M.
de la Bourbonais would make no
difficulty in accepting the service
from you.”</p>

<p>“Humph! As ill-luck will have
it, there is a coldness between us at
present,” said Sir Simon&mdash;“a little
tiff that will blow off after a while
but meanwhile Bourbonais is as unapproachable
as a porcupine. He’s
as proud as Lucifer at any time,
and I fear there is no one but myself
from whom he would accept a
service of the kind.”</p>

<p>“Could not Langrove manage
it? They seemed on affectionate
terms,” said Clide.</p>

<p>“Oh! no, oh! no. That would
never do!” said Sir Simon quickly.
“I don’t see any one at Dullerton
but myself who could attempt it.”</p>

<p>“Well, but some one must, since
you say you can’t,” argued Clide
with impatience. “When do you
return to the Court?”</p>

<p>“I did not mean to return just
yet a while. You see, I have a
great deal of business to look to&mdash;of
a pleasant sort, thanks to you,
my dear boy, but still imperative
and admitting of no delay. I can’t
possibly leave town until it has
been settled.”</p>

<p>“I should have thought Simpson
might have attended to it. I suppose
you mean legal matters?” said
the young man with some asperity.
He could not understand Sir Simon’s
being hindered by mere business
from sparing a day in a case
of such emergency, and for such a
friend. It was unlike him to be
selfish, and this was downright
heartlessness.</p>

<p>“Simpson? To be sure!” exclaimed
the baronet jubilantly,
starting up and seizing his hat.
“I will be off and see him this
minute. Simpson is sure to hit on
some device; he’s never at a loss
for anything.”</p>

<h3>THE STORY OF EVANGELINE IN PROSE.</h3>

<p>I spare you M. Jourdain’s oft-quoted
saying. Too often, I fear,
I successfully imitate the “Bourgeois
Gentilhomme” in speaking
prose without knowing it&mdash;aye, at
the very moment when I think to
woo the Muse most ardently. But
great is the courage demanded to
announce a purpose to be prosaic&mdash;prosy,
it may be&mdash;with premeditation.
Especially true is this
when, as in the case before me, the
subject itself ranks high as poetry.
Mr. Longfellow, in some of his
later writings, may seem to aim
at, or does, perhaps, unconsciously
catch, that tone, made fashionable
by the younger Victorian songsters,
which sets the poet apart as a
being differing from his kind, and
makes him, as the English poet-laureate
does, “born in a golden
clime”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“With golden stars above.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But in his “Tale of Acadie” our
American Wordsworth touches with
sympathetic finger the chords that
vibrate with feeling in common
hearts. This is the lyre he sweeps
with a magic sweetness not excelled
by any modern English poet.
<cite>Evangeline</cite> is a poem of the
hearth and domestic love. That
is to say, though it is true the heroine
and her betrothed never come
together in one happy home, the
feelings described are such as might
without shame beat tenderly in any
Christian maiden’s breast; such, too,
as any husband might wish his wife
to feel. How different is this from
the fierce passion&mdash;a surrender to
the lower nature&mdash;which burns and
writhes and contorts itself in
Mr. Swinburne’s heroines! One is
Christian Love, the other the pagan
brutishness of Juvenal’s Messalina.
It may be said indeed with truth
that, in portraying a Catholic maiden
and a Catholic community, Mr.
Longfellow has, with the intuition
of genius, reflected in this poem
the purity and fidelity blessed by
the church in the love it sanctions.
His admirers, therefore, cannot but
regret that debasing contact with the
new school of the XIXth-century
realism which, in such an one of his
later poems, for example, as that
entitled “Love,” draws him to the
worship of the “languors” and
“kisses” of the Lucretian Venus.
The love of Evangeline is that
which is affected by refined women in
every society&mdash;humble though the
poet’s heroine be; the other strips
the veil from woman’s weakness.</p>

<p>The charm of the poem is that it
transports us to a scene Arcadian,
idyllic, yet which impresses us with
its truthfulness to nature. This
is not Acadia only, but Arcadia.
The nymphs, and the shepherds
and shepherdesses, and the god
Pan with his oaten reed, put off
the stage costumes worn by them
in the pages of Virgil or on the
canvas of Watteau, and, lo! here
they are in real life in the village
of Grand Pré&mdash;Evangeline milking
the kine, Gabriel Lajeunesse, and
Michael the fiddler, and the level
Acadian meadows walled in by
their dykes from the turmoil of
war that shook the world all around
them. The picture is truthful; but
truthful rather by the effect of the
bold touches that befit the artist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[605]</a></span>
and poet than in the multitude of
details&mdash;some more prosaic, some
not so charming&mdash;which, massed together,
make up the more faithful
portrait of the historian. The description
of scenery in the poem
confuses the natural features of
two widely-separated and different
sections of the country; the Evangeline
of Grand Pré is not in all
respects the Acadian girl of Charlevoix
or Murdock; the history of
men and manners on the shores of
the Basin of Mines,<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> as depicted
by the poet, is sadly at variance
with the angry, tumultuous, suspicious,
blood-stained annals of those
settlements. Strange as it may
seem, the poem is truer of the Acadians
of to-day, again living in
Nova Scotia, than of their expatriated
forefathers. Remoteness of
time did not mean, in their case, a
golden age of peace and plenty.
Far from it! It meant ceaseless
war on the borders, the threats
and intrigues of a deadly national
feud, the ever-present, overhanging
doom of exile, military tyranny,
and constant English espionage.
Now absolute peace reigns within
the townships still peopled by their
descendants, and the Acadian peasant
and village maiden cling in silence
and undisturbed to the manners
their fathers brought from Normandy
nearly three centuries ago.</p>

<p>The first few lines give the coloring
to the whole poem. They are
the setting within which are grouped
the characters.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“This is the forest primeval. The murmuring pines and the hemlocks,</div>
<div class="verse">Bearded with moss, and in garments green, indistinct in the twilight,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">stand “like Druids of eld,” or
“harpers hoar”;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“While from its rocky caverns the deep-voiced neighboring ocean</div>
<div class="verse">Speaks, and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is the refrain running through
the poem like the <i lang="it">aria</i> of the
“Last Rose of Summer” through
<cite>Martha</cite>. Yet the picture conveyed
to the reader’s mind is that
of the Atlantic coast of Acadia, or
Nova Scotia, not of the Basin of
Mines, where Evangeline dwelt with
her people. The natural features
of the two sections of country are
strikingly diverse. On the east
coast of Nova Scotia rises a line of
granitic and other cliffs, sterile, vast,
jagged, opposing their giant shoulders
to the roaring surges of the
Atlantic. On the hills behind, the
pines and hemlocks rustle and murmur
in answer to the waves. This
is the “forest primeval” and the
“loud-voiced neighboring ocean.”
But on the west coast is quite another
scene. The Basin of Mines
is an inland gulf of an inland sea&mdash;the
Bay of Fundy. Here the granite
rocks and murmuring pines give
place to red clay-banks and overflowed
marshes. And here is Horton,
or Grand Pré. It is separated
by the whole breadth of the peninsula
of Nova Scotia from the
ocean. The “mists from the mighty
Atlantic,” which</p>

<p class="noindent">are in reality the fogs of the Bay
of Fundy shut out by the North
Mountain. Instead of the long
swell of the Atlantic breaking on a
rocky coast, we have in the Basin
of Mines numerous small rivers
running through an alluvial country,
with high clay-banks left bare
by the receding tide. This last
feature of the scene is correctly
described by the poet; but it must
be borne in mind that it is not united
with the natural features of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[606]</a></span>
east coast. The Acadians never,
in fact, affected the Atlantic sea-board.
They sailed shuddering
past its frowning and wintry walls,
and, doubling Cape Sable, beat up
the Bay of Fundy to where the
sheltered Basins of Port Royal and
Mines invited an entrance from
the west. For over one hundred
years after the founding of Port
Royal the Atlantic coast of Acadia
remained a waste. A fishing-village
at Canseau on the north&mdash;a
sort of stepping-stone to and from
the great fortress of Louisburg&mdash;and
a few scattered houses and
clearings near La Tour’s first settlement
alone broke the monotonous
silence of the wilderness. The
Indian hunter tracking the moose
over the frozen surface of the snow,
and some half-solitary Irish and
New England fishermen in Chebucto
Bay, divided the rest of the
country between them. It was
not until 1749 that Cornwallis
landed his colonists at Halifax, and
made the first solid footing on the
Atlantic coast. But for generations
previously, in the rich valley of the
River of Port Royal, and along the
fertile banks of the streams flowing
into the Basin of Mines&mdash;the Gaspereau,
the Canard, and the Pereau&mdash;the
thrifty Acadians spread
their villages, built their churches,
and were married and buried by
the good Recollect Fathers.</p>

<p>I was a lad scarce emancipated
from college when I first visited
those scenes. I remember well my
emotion when I drew my eyes away
from the landscape, and, turning to
my companion, Father K&mdash;&mdash;, asked
him if there were any remains
of the old village of Grand Pré.
To my youthful imagination Evangeline
was as real as the people
about me. Father K&mdash;&mdash; was the
priest stationed at Kentville, about
ten miles distant from Grand Pré
and the Gaspereau River, which
were included in his mission. He
was an old family friend, and I
was going to spend the summer vacation
with him. We were driving
from Windsor through Horton and
Wolfville to Kentville, passing on
our road through all the scenes described
in the poem. I have often
visited that part of the country
since then, but never has it made
such an impression on me. The
stage-coach then rolled between
Windsor and Kentville, and something
of the rural simplicity congenial
with the poem was still felt to
be around one. Last year I rode by
rail over the same ground, and later
on another line of railroad to
Truro, and thence around the Basin
of Mines on the north through
Cumberland. But my feelings had
changed, or the whistle of the locomotive
was a sound alien to the
memories of those green meadows
and intersecting dykes. Evangeline
was no longer a being to be
loved, but a beautiful figment of
the poet’s brain.</p>

<p>I don’t know to this day whether
Father K&mdash;&mdash; was quizzing me, or
was loath to shatter my boyish
romance, when he told me that there
were some old ruins which were
said to be the home of Evangeline.
It is probable he was having a
quiet joke at my expense, as he was
noted for his fund of humor, which I
learned better to appreciate in later
years. Poor Father K&mdash;&mdash;! He
was a splendid type of the old Irish
missionary priest&mdash;an admirable
Latinist; well read in English literature,
especially the Queen Anne
poets; hearty, jovial, and could tell
a story that would set the table in a
roar. And, withal, no priest worked
harder than he did in his wide and
laborious mission, or was a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[607]</a></span>
tender-hearted friend of the poor and
afflicted. He is since dead.</p>

<p>During the month or six weeks
I spent with Father K&mdash;&mdash;, that
part of the country became quite
familiar to me by means of his numerous
drives on parish duties,
when I usually accompanied him.
Often, as the shades of the summer
evening descended, have I watched
the mists across the Basin shrouding
the bluff front of Cape Blomidon&mdash;“Blow-me-down,”
as it is more
commonly called by the country-folk.
At other times we drove up
the North Mountain, where the</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Sea-fogs pitched their tents,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and, standing there, I have looked
down upon the distant glittering
waters of the Bay of Fundy.</p>

<p>On one occasion we rode over
from Kentville to Wolfville, and
then up the Gaspereau, at the
mouth of which</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The English ships at their anchors”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">swung with the tide on the morning
which ushered in the doom
of Grand Pré. We rode some
distance up the valley to the house
of a Catholic farmer, and there put
up for the day. It was the day on
which the elections took place for
the House of Assembly. The contest
was fiercely conducted amid
great popular excitement. One of
those “No-Popery” cries, fomented
by an artful politician&mdash;which
sometimes sweep the colonies as
well as the mother country&mdash;was
raging in the province. Father
K&mdash;&mdash; left Kentville, the county
town, on that day to avoid all appearance
of interference in the
election, and also to get away from
the noise and confusion that pervaded
the long main street of the
village. I can remember the news
coming up the Gaspereau in the
evening how every one of the four
candidates opposed to Father
K&mdash;&mdash; had been returned. But at
that time I paid little heed to politics,
and during the day I wandered
down through the field to the river,
and strolled along its willow-fringed
banks. Some of those willows
were very aged, and might have
swung their long, slim wands
and narrow-pointed leaves over an
Evangeline and a Gabriel a hundred
years before. Those willows
were not the natural growth of the
forest, but were planted there&mdash;by
whom? No remnant of the people
that first tilled the valley was
left to say!</p>

<p>Riding home next day, a laughable
incident, but doubtless somewhat
annoying to Father K&mdash;&mdash;,
occurred. Just as we were about
to turn a narrow bend of the road,
suddenly we were confronted by a
long procession in carriages and
all sorts of country vehicles, with
banners flying, men shouting, and
everything to indicate a triumphal
parade. It was, in fact, a procession
escorting two of the “No-Popery”
members elected the day
before. The position was truly
rueful, but Father K&mdash;&mdash; had to
grin and bear it. There was no
escape for us; we had to draw up
at the side of the road, and sit
quietly in our single wagon until
the procession passed us. It was
a very orderly and good-humored
crowd, but there were a good many
broad grins, as they rode by, at
having caught the portly and generally
popular priest in such a trap.
Nothing would persuade them, of
course, but that he had been working
might and main for the other
side during the election. Finally,
as the tail of the procession passed
us, some one in the rear, more in
humor than in malice, sang out:
“To h&mdash;ll with the Pope.” There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[608]</a></span>
was a roar of laughter at this, during
which Father K&mdash;&mdash; gathered
up his reins, and, saying something
under his breath which I will not
vouch for as strictly a blessing,
applied the whip to old Dobbin
with an energy that that respectable
quadruped must have thought demanded
explanation.</p>

<p>Changed indeed was such a
scene from those daily witnessed
when Father Felician,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Priest and pedagogue both in the village,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">ruled over his peaceful congregation
at the mouth of the Gaspereau.</p>

<p>It has been said in the beginning
of this article that Evangeline, the
heroine and central figure of the
poem, is not altogether true to history
as typical of the Acadian girl
of that period, as seen in the annals
of Port Royal; and doubtless
this assertion can be borne out
by the records. But, on second
thoughts, it does appear, as it were,
a profanation to subject such a
bright creation of the poet’s mind
to the analysis of history. As profitably
might we set about converting
the diamond into its original
carbon. The magical chemistry of
genius, as of nature, has in either
case fused the dull and common
atoms into the sparkling and priceless
jewel.</p>

<p>The stoutest champion of her
sex will not, upon consideration,
contend that so absolutely perfect
a creature as Evangeline is likely
to be found in any possible phase
of society. Is not a spice of coquetry
inseparable from all women?
Evangeline has none of it.
She is, too, too unconscious that
her lover</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Watches for the gleam of her lamp and her shadow”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">under the trees in the orchard.
She is the heroine of an idyl&mdash;not,
indeed, of unreal Arthurian
romance, but of that exalted and
passionless love which the virgin
heart seeks, but afterwards consoles
itself for not finding. That
ideal star does not shine upon this
world; but its divine rays fall softly
upon many an unknown heart in
the cloister.</p>

<p>But it is incontestable that the
Acadian maidens of Port Royal
and Mines shared in some of the
agreeable frivolities which still, it
is said, sometimes distinguish their
sisters in the world. They had an
eye for a military uniform and
clanking spurs even in those “primeval”
days. It is a frequent
complaint of the French governors
to the home authorities at
Paris that their young officers were
being continually led into marriage
with girls of the country “without
birth,” and, worse still, often “without
money.” In the old parish
register of Annapolis can be seen
more than one entry of the union
of a gallant ensign or captain to a
village belle from the inland settlements
whose visit to the Acadian
metropolis had subjugated the Gallic
son of Mars. Nor was the
goddess of fashion altogether without
a shrine in close contiguity to
the “murmuring pines and the
hemlocks.” Some of the naval and
military officers sent for their wives
from Paris or Quebec, and these
fine ladies brought their maids with
them. This is not a supposition,
but a fact which can be verified by
reference to the letters of M. des
Goutins and others in the correspondence
of the time. Imagine a
Parisian soubrette of the XVIIIth
century in the village of Grand
Pré! It is a shock to those who
derive their knowledge of Acadie
from Mr. Longfellow’s poem; but
those who are familiar with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[609]</a></span>
voluminous records of the day, preserved
in the provincial archives,
are aware of a good many stranger
things than that related in them.
Since <cite>Evangeline</cite> was published
the Canadian and Nova Scotian
governments have done much to
collect and edit their records, and
they are now accessible to the student.
Rightly understood, there is
no reason why the flood of light thus
thrown upon the lives of the Acadians
should detract anything from
our admiration for that simple and
kindly race. They were not faultless;
but the very fact that they
shared in the common interests,
and even foibles, of the rest of the
world gives that tone of reality to
their history which makes us sympathize
with them more justly in
the cruel fate that overtook them.
Yet, in depicting the young Acadian
girl of that period as he has
done, the poet has but idealized
the truth. The march of the history
of her people aids him in
making the portrait a faithful one.
Had he placed the time a little
earlier&mdash;that is to say, under the
French-Acadian <i lang="fr">régime</i>&mdash;and his
heroine at Annapolis, his poem
could not have borne the criticism
of later research. But in selecting
the most dramatic incident of
Acadian history as the central
point of interest, he has necessarily
shifted the scene to one of the Neutral
French settlements. Here,
too, he is aided in maintaining the
truthfulness of his portraiture by
the fact that the English conquest,
in depriving the Acadians of the
right of political action, and cutting
them off as much as possible
from intercourse with Canada and
France, had thrown them back
upon rural occupations alone, and
developed their simple virtues.
Mines and Chignecto had been
noted for their rustic independence
and their manners uncorrupted by
contact with the world, even under
the old <i lang="fr">régime</i>. One of the military
governors of Port Royal complains
of them as “semi-republicans”
in a letter to the Minister
of Marine and Colonies at Paris.
After the conquest of 1710, intercourse
with Annapolis and its
English Government House and
foreign garrison became even more
restricted. No oath of allegiance
being taken to the new government,
the <i lang="fr">curé</i> was recognized
both by the inhabitants and the
Annapolis government as their
virtual ruler. Under the mild
sway of Fathers Felix, Godalie,
and Miniac&mdash;in turn <i lang="fr">curés</i> of
Mines&mdash;the Acadians sought to
forget in the cultivation of their
fields the stern military surveillance
of Annapolis, and, later, Fort
Edwards and Fort Lawrence. Father
Miniac comes latest in time,
and shared the misfortunes of his
flock in their expulsion. But in
Father Godalie, the accomplished
scholar and long-loved friend of
the people of Grand Pré, we seem
best to recognize the “Father Felician”
of Mr. Longfellow’s poem.
He was a guide well fitted to form
the lovely character of Evangeline;
nor do the authentic records
of the time bear less ample testimony
to the virtue of his people
than the glowing imagination of
the poet.</p>

<p>It is less in the delineation of
individual character than in its
description of the undisturbed
peace reigning at Grand Pré that
the poem departs most from the
truth of history. The expulsion of
1755 was not a thunderbolt in a
clear sky descending upon a garden
of Eden. It was a doom known to
be hanging over them for forty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[610]</a></span>
years. Its shadow, more or less
threatening for two generations, was
present in every Acadian household,
disabling industry and driving
the young men into service or
correspondence with their French
compatriots. Space would not
permit, in so short a paper, to enter
into the history of that desperate
struggle for supremacy on this continent
ending on the heights of Abraham,
isolated chapters of which
have been narrated with a graphic
pen by Mr. Francis Parkman.
Acadie was one of its chosen battlegrounds.
So far from the Acadians
living in rural peace and content,
it may be said broadly yet accurately
that from the date of their first
settlement to their final expulsion
from the country, during a period
extending over one hundred and
fifty years, five years had never
passed consecutively without hostilities,
open or threatened. The
province changed masters, or was
wholly or partially conquered, seven
times in a little over one hundred
years, and the final English conquest,
so far from establishing peace,
left the Acadians in a worse position
than before. They refused to
take the oath of allegiance to the
English government; the French
government was not able to protect
them, though it used them to
harass the English.</p>

<p>They acquired, therefore, by a
sort of tacit understanding, the title
and position of the “Neutral
French,” the English government
simply waiting from year to year
until it felt itself strong enough to
remove them <i lang="fr">en masse</i> from the
province, and the Acadians yearly
expecting succor from Quebec or
Louisburg. Each party regarded
the other as aliens and enemies.
Hence it is that no French-Acadian
would ever have used the words
“his majesty’s mandate”&mdash;applied
to George II.&mdash;as spoken by Basil
the blacksmith in the poem. That
single expression conveys a radically
false impression of the feelings
of the people at the time. The
church at Mines, or Grand Pré,
from the belfry of which</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Softly the Angelus sounded,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">had been burned down twice by
the English and its altar vessels
stolen by Col. Church in the old
wars. Nor had permanent conquest,
as we have said, brought any change
for the better. The <i lang="fr">curés</i> were
frequently imprisoned on pretext of
exciting attacks on the English garrisons,
and sometimes, as in the
case of Father Felix and Father
Charlemagne, were exiled from the
province. In 1714 the intention
was first announced of transporting
all the Acadians from their homes.
It was proposed to remove them to
Cape Breton, still held by the
French. The pathetic remonstrance
of Father Felix Palm, the <i lang="fr">curé</i> of
Grand Pré, in a letter and petition
to the governor, averted this great
calamity from his people at that
time. But the project was again
revived by the English Board of
Trade, 1720-30. In pursuance of
its orders, Gov. Philipps issued a
proclamation commanding the people
of Mines to come in and take
the oath of allegiance by a certain
day, or to depart forthwith out of
the province, permitting, at the same
time&mdash;a stretch of generosity which
will hardly be appreciated at this
day&mdash;each family to carry away
with it “two sheep,” but all the
rest of their property to be confiscated.
This storm also blew over.
But the result of this continual harassment
and threatening was to
drive the Acadians into closer correspondence
with the French at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[611]</a></span>
Louisburg, and to cause their
young men to enlist in the French-Canadian
forces on the frontier.
In view of this aid and comfort
given to the enemy, and their persistent
refusal to take the oath of
allegiance, later English writers
have not hesitated to declare the
removal of the Acadians from the
province a political and military
necessity. But the otherwise unanimous
voice of humanity has unequivocally
denounced their wholesale
deportation as one of the most
cruel and tyrannical acts in the colonial
history of England. We are
not to suppose, however, that the
Acadians folded their hands while
utter ruin was thus threatening
them. In 1747 they joined in the
attack on Col. Noble’s force at
Mines, in which one hundred of
the English were killed and wounded,
and the rest of his command
made prisoners. They were accused,
not without some show of
reason, of supporting the Indians
in their attack on the new settlement
at Halifax. It is admitted
that three hundred of them, including
many of the young men
from Grand Pré, were among the
prisoners taken at Fort Beau Sejour
on the border a few months before
their expulsion. It is not our purpose
to enter into any defence or
condemnation of those hostilities.
But it is plain that Mr. Longfellow’s
beautiful lines describing the
columns of pale blue smoke, like
clouds of incense, ascending</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“From a hundred hearths, the homes of peace and contentment,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">“free from fear, that reigns with
the tyrant, or envy, the vice of republics,”
were not applicable to the
condition of affairs at Grand Pré in
1755, nor at any time.</p>

<p>The poem follows with fidelity
the outlines of the scenes of the expulsion.
Heart-rending indeed is
the scene, as described even by those
who were agents in its execution.
The poet gives almost <i lang="la">verbatim</i> the
address of Col. John Winslow in the
chapel. Nevertheless one important
clause is omitted. Barbarous as
were the orders of Gov. Lawrence,
he was not absolutely devoid of humanity.
Some attempt was made
to lessen the pangs of separation
from their country by the issuing
of orders to the military commanders
that “whole families should go
together on the same transport.”
These orders were communicated
with the others to the inhabitants
by Col. Winslow, and it appears,
they were faithfully executed as far
as the haste of embarkation would
permit. But as the young men
marched separately to the ships,
and some of them escaped for a
time into the woods, there was nothing
to prevent such an incident
occurring as the separation of
Evangeline and Gabriel.</p>

<p>About seven thousand (7,000)
Acadians, according to Gov. Lawrence’s
letter to Col. Winslow, were
transported from their homes. The
total number of these unfortunate
people in the province at that time
has been estimated at eighteen
thousand. The destruction was
more complete at Grand Pré than
elsewhere, that being the oldest settlement,
with the exception of Annapolis,
and the most prosperous
and thickly settled. A few years
later another attempt was made to
transfer the remainder of the Acadian
population to New England;
but the transports were not permitted
to land them at Boston, as they
were completely destitute, and the
New England commonwealths petitioned
against being made responsible
for their support. The Acadian
exiles were scattered over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[612]</a></span>
Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Georgia.
About four hundred and fifty were
landed at Philadelphia.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“In that delightful land which is washed by the Delaware’s waters,</div>

<div class="verse">There from the troubled sea had Evangeline landed, an exile,</div>
<div class="verse">Finding among the children of Penn a home and a country.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A few months ago I visited the
Quaker City. There, where Evangeline
ended her long pilgrimage, I
took up the thread of that story
the early scenes of which had been
so familiar to me. How different
those around me! Gone were the
balsamic odors of the pines and the
salt spray of the ocean. One can
conceive how the hearts of the
poor Acadian exiles must have
trembled. I sought out the old
“Swedish church at Wicaco,”
whence the “sounds of psalms</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Across the meadows were wafted”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">on the Sabbath morning when
Evangeline went on her way to the
hospital, and there found her lover
dying unknown. The quaint little
church&mdash;not larger than a country
school-house&mdash;built of red and
black bricks brought from Sweden,
is now almost lost in a corner near
the river’s edge, in the midst of
huge warehouses and intersecting
railroad tracks. In the wall near
the minister’s desk is a tablet in
memory of the first pastor and his
wife buried beneath. Fastened to
the gallery of the choir&mdash;not much
higher than one’s head&mdash;is the old
Swedish Bible first used in the
church, and over it two gilded
wooden cherubs&mdash;also brought from
Sweden&mdash;that make one smile at
their comical features. In the
churchyard, under the blue and
faded gray tombstones, repose the
men and women of the congregation
of 1755 and years before. But
no vestiges of the Acadian wanderers
remain in the Catholic burying-ground.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">“Side by side in their nameless graves the lovers are sleeping.</div>
<div class="verse">Under the humble walls of the little Catholic churchyard,</div>
<div class="verse">In the heart of the city, they lie unknown and unnoticed.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Many of the Acadians succeeded
in wandering back to their country.
Others escaped into what is now
called New Brunswick, which was
then a part of Acadia, and either
returned to Nova Scotia in after-years
when the whole of Canada
was finally ceded to the English, or
founded settlements, existing to
this day in New Brunswick, and
returning their own members to the
Provincial Parliaments. The descendants
of the Acadians, still
speaking the French language and
retaining the manners of their forefathers,
are more numerous than is
generally supposed in Nova Scotia.
They number thirty-two thousand
out of a total population of three
hundred and eighty-seven thousand
(387,000), according to the census
of 1871. The poet says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Only along the shore of the mournful and misty Atlantic</div>
<div class="verse">Linger a few Acadian peasants.…</div>
<div class="verse">Maidens still wear their Norman caps and their kirtles of homespun,</div>
<div class="verse">And by the evening fire repeat Evangeline’s story.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This refers, no doubt, to the settlement
at Chezzetcook, which, from
its closeness to Halifax, is best
known. On Saturday mornings, in
the market at Halifax, the Acadian
women can be seen standing with
their baskets of eggs and woollen
mitts and socks for sale. They are
at once recognized by their short
blue woollen outer petticoats or kirtles,
and their little caps, with their
black hair drawn tightly up from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[613]</a></span>
the forehead under them. The
young girls are often very pretty.
They have delicate features, an
oval face, a clear olive complexion,
and eyes dark and shy, like a
fawn’s. They soon fade, and get a
weather-beaten and hard expression
from exposure to the climate on
their long journeys on foot and
from severe toil.</p>

<p>But in Yarmouth County, and on
the other side of the peninsula in
the township of Clare, Digby County,
there are much larger and more
prosperous settlements. Clare is
almost exclusively French-Acadian.
The people generally send their
own member to the provincial
House of Assembly. He speaks
French more fluently than English.
The priest preaches in French.
Here at this day is to be found
the counterpart of the manners
of Grand Pré. Virtue, peace, and
happiness reign in more than “a
hundred homes” under the old customs.
Maidens as pure and sweet
as Evangeline can be seen as of
old walking down the road to the
church on a Sunday morning with
their “chaplet of beads and their
missal.” But the modern dressmaker
and milliner has made more
headway than among the poor Chezzetcook
people. Grand Pré itself,
and most of the old Acadian settlements,
are inhabited by a purely
British race&mdash;descendants of the
North of Ireland and New England
settlers who received grants of the
confiscated lands. By a singular
turn of fortune’s wheel the descendants
of another expatriated race&mdash;the
American loyalists&mdash;now people
a large part of the province
once held by the exiled Acadians.</p>

<h3>SIR THOMAS MORE.<br />
<i>A HISTORICAL ROMANCE.</i></h3>

<p class="center">FROM THE FRENCH OF THE PRINCESSE DE CRAON.</p>

<h4>IV.</h4>

<p>William du Bellay having remained
in France, M. de Vaux had
been sent to replace him in England.
The latter, having but recently returned
from Rome, where he was
attached to the embassy of M. de
Grammont, French ambassador to
that court, was not yet initiated into
the state of affairs as they existed
at the court of Henry VIII.</p>

<p>Du Bellay was not satisfied with
the change; and the old diplomate,
finding his new assistant inclined
to be somewhat dull, undertook to
enlighten him&mdash;leading him on step
by step into the intricacies of diplomacy,
like a mother, or rather a
governess, a little brusque, who is
impatient at the slow progress the
child makes in learning to walk.</p>

<p>“Come!” he exclaimed, “I see
you understand nothing of this; so
I shall have to be patient and begin
it all over again. It is incredible,”
he added, by way of digression, addressing
himself to the public (who
was absent), “what absurd reports
are circulated outside with regard
to what we say and do in our secret
negotiations! It extends even to
all these harebrains of the court;
but you who have a foot in diplomacy
I cannot excuse. Come, let
us see&mdash;we say:</p>

<p>“When my brother left, he went
to demand on the part of Henry
VIII., of the universities of France,
and above all that of Paris (preponderating
over all the others)&mdash;remark
well: to demand, I say&mdash;that
they should give decisions favorable
to the divorce. Now, this
point appeared at first quite insignificant;
but it is just here we have
shown our ability (I would say I,
but I do not wish to vaunt <em>myself</em>
over a young man just starting out
in the world like yourself). Then
our king has replied to the King of
England that he would ask nothing
better than to use his influence
with the universities to induce
them to give satisfaction on this
subject; but that (notice this especially)
the Emperor Charles V. had
made precisely the same demand in
an opposite direction, in favor of
Queen Catherine, his aunt; that if
he refused the emperor, he would
be extremely displeased, and that
he was compelled to reflect a second
time, because the princes, his children,
were held as hostages in the
hands of the emperor, and in spite
of all his efforts he had not yet
been able to pay the price of their
ransom stipulated at the treaty of
Cambrai.</p>

<p>“It then remained to say that
we could do nothing for him&mdash;on
the contrary, must oppose him so
long as the children were held prisoners,
or while there was even a
chance that they would be restored
to us on condition that we should
throw our influence on the side of
Queen Catherine. All of which
is as clear as day&mdash;is it not? Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[615]</a></span>
you are going to see if I have understood
how to take advantage of
these considerations with Henry
VIII.”</p>

<p>Saying this, with a slightly derisive
smile, Du Bellay took from a
drawer a casket of green sharkskin,
which he handed to De Vaux, who
opened it eagerly.</p>

<p>“Oh! how beautiful,” he exclaimed,
taking from the case and
holding up in the sunlight a magnificent
<i lang="fr">fleur de lis</i> composed entirely
of diamonds. “Oh! this is most
superb.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is beautiful!” replied
Du Bellay with a satisfied air, “and
worth one hundred and fifty thousand
crowns. Philip, the emperor’s
father, pledged it to the King of
England for that sum. We are
obliged by the treaty to redeem it;
but as we have not the money to
pay, it has been made a present to
us. And here is what is better
still,” he added, displaying a quittance&mdash;“a
receipt in full for five
hundred thousand crowns which
the emperor owed Henry VIII.;
and he now makes a present of it to
Francis I., to enable him to pay
immediately the two millions required
for the ransom of the
princes.”</p>

<p>“That is admirable!” cried De
Vaux. “It must be admitted, my
lord, that we shall be under great
obligations to Mlle. Anne.”</p>

<p>“All disorders cost dear, my
child,” replied Du Bellay; “and if
this continues, they will ruin England.
Think of what will have to
be paid yet to the University of
Paris!…”</p>

<p>“And do you suppose they will
consent to this demand?” interrupted
De Vaux.</p>

<p>“No, truly, I do not believe it,”
replied Du Bellay. “Except Master
Gervais, who is always found ready
to do anything asked of him, I know
not how they will decide; but, between
ourselves, I tell you I believe
they will be against it. But, observe,
we have not promised a
favorable decision&mdash;we have only
left it to be hoped for; which is
quite a different thing.”</p>

<p>“That is very adroit,” replied De
Vaux, “assuredly; but it seems to
me not very honest.”</p>

<p>“How! not honest?” murmured
Du Bellay, contracting his little
gray eyebrows, and fixing his greenish
eyes on the fair face of the
youth. “Not honest!” he again
exclaimed in a stentorian voice.
“Where do you come from, then,
young man? Know that among
these people honesty is a thing unheard
of. Others less candid than
myself may tell you the contrary,
knowing very well that such is not
the truth. They arrange projects
with the intention of defeating
them; they sign treaties with the
studied purpose of violating them;
they swear to keep the peace in
order to prepare for war; and a
state sells her authority and puts
her influence in the balance of the
world in favor of the highest bidder.
Let the price be earth or
metal, it is of no consequence; I
make no distinction. When Henry
devastated our territories and took
possession of our provinces, was it
just? No! ‘Might makes right’;
that is the veritable law of nations&mdash;the
only one they are willing to acknowledge
or adopt. In default of
strength, there remains stratagem;
and I must use it!”</p>

<p>“Under existing circumstances
you are right,” replied De Vaux,
replacing in its case the superb <i lang="fr">fleur
de lis</i>, and again waving it in the
sunlight. “It is a pity,” he added,
“that they may be obliged to return
this; it would set off wonderfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[616]</a></span>
well the wedding dress of the
future Duchess of Orleans.”</p>

<p>“What! are they speaking already
of the marriage of the young Duke of
Orleans?” asked Du Bellay in surprise.</p>

<p>“Ah! that is a great secret,” replied
De Vaux confidentially. “You
know our king has not abandoned
the idea of subjugating the Milanese,
and, to ensure the pope’s friendship,
he offers to marry his second son to
his niece, the young Catherine de’
Medici.”</p>

<p>“No!” cried M. du Bellay. “No,
it is impossible! How can they forget
that but a short time since the
Medici family was composed of
only the simple merchants of Florence?”</p>

<p>“It has all been arranged, notwithstanding,”
replied De Vaux.
“In spite of all our precautions, the
emperor has been apprised of it.
At first he refused to credit it, and
would not believe the King of
France could really think of allying
his noble blood with that of the
Medici. In the meantime he has
been so much frightened, lest the
hope of this alliance would not
sufficiently dazzle Clement VIII.,
that he has made a proposal to break
off the marriage of his niece, the
Princess of Denmark, with the Duke
of Milan, and substitute the young
Catherine in her place. We have,
as you may well suppose, promptly
advised M. de Montmorency of all
these things, who returned us, on the
spot, full power to sign the articles.
M. de Grammont immediately carried
them to the pope; and he
was greatly delighted, as Austria, it
seems, had already got ahead of us,
and persuaded him that we had no
other intention than to deceive him
and gain time. Now everything is
harmoniously arranged. They promise
for the marriage portion of
Catherine Reggio, Pisa, Leghorn,
Modena, Ribera, the Duchy of
Urbino; and Francis I. cedes to
his son his claims to the Duchy
of Milan.”</p>

<p>“Sad compensation for a bad
marriage!” replied M. du Bellay
angrily: “new complications which
will only result in bringing about interminable
disputes! Princes can
never learn to be contented with
the territory already belonging to
them. Although they may not possess
sufficient ability to govern even
<em>that</em> well, still they are always trying
to extend it. War must waste
and ruin a happy and flourishing
country, in order to put them in possession
of a few feet of desolated
earth, all sprinkled with gold and
watered with blood.”</p>

<p>“Ah! yes,” interrupted De Vaux
earnestly, “we have learned this
cruelly and to our cost. And relentless
history will record without regret
the account of our reverses,
and the captivity of a king so valiant
and dauntless&mdash;a king who has
sacrificed everything save his honor.”</p>

<p>“Reflect, my dear, on all this.
The honor of a king consists not in
sacrificing the happiness of his people.
A soldier should be brave&mdash;the
head of a nation should be wise
and prudent,” replied Du Bellay, as
he turned over a great file of papers
in search of something, “Valor
without prudence is worthless.
The intrigues of the cabinet are
more certain; they are of more
value than the best generals. They,
at least, are never entirely defeated;
the disaster of the evening inspires
renewed strength for the morrow.
Cold, hunger, and sickness are not
able to destroy them.… They
can only waste a few words or lose
a sum of money. A dozen well-chosen
spies spread their toils in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[617]</a></span>
every direction; we hold them like
bundles of straw in our hands;
they glide in the dark, slip through
your fingers&mdash;an army that cannot
be captured, which exists not and
yet never dies; which drags to
the tribunal of those who pay them,
without pity as without discrimination,
without violence as without
hesitation, the hearts of all mankind.</p>

<p>“Gold, my child, but never blood!
With bread we can move the world;
with blood we destroy it. Your
heart, young man, leaps within you
at the sound of the shrill trumpet,
when glittering banners wave and
the noise of battle inebriates your
soul. But look behind you, child,
look behind you: the squadron
has passed. Hear the shrieks and
groans of the dying. Behold those
men dragging themselves over the
trampled field; their heads gashed
and bleeding, their bones dislocated,
their limbs torn; streams of
blood flow from their wounds; they
die in an ocean furnished from
their own lacerated veins. Go there
to the field of carnage and death;
pause beside that man with pallid
face and agonized expression; think
of the tender care and painful anxiety
of the mother who reared him
from his cradle. How often she
has pressed her lips upon the golden
curls of her boy, the hope of her
old age, which must now end in
despair! Reflect there, upon the
field of carnage and death, on the
tender caresses of wives, sisters,
and friends. Imagine the brother’s
grief, the deep anguish of the father.
Alas! all these recollections
pass in an instant before the half-open
eyes of the dying. Farewell!
dream of glory, hateful vision now
for ever vanished. Life is almost
extinct, yet with the latest breath
he thinks but of them! ‘They will
see me no more! I must die far
away, without being able to bid
them a last adieu.’ Such are the
bitter thoughts murmured by his
dying lips as the last sigh is breathed
forth. Tell me, young man,
have you never reflected when, on
the field glittering in the bright
summer sunshine, you have seen
the heavy, well-drilled battalions
advance; when the prince rode in
the midst of them, and they saluted
him with shouts of enthusiasm and
love; when that prince, a weak
man like themselves, elated with
pride, said to them: ‘March on to
death; it is for me that you go!’
For you! And who are you? Their
executioner, who throws their ashes
to the wind of your ambition, to
satisfy the thirst of your covetousness,
the insolent pride of your
name, which the century will see
buried in oblivion! Ah! my son,”
continued the old diplomate, deeply
affected, with his hands crossed on
the packet of papers, that he had
entirely forgotten, “if you knew
how much I have seen in my life
of these horrible calamities, of these
monstrous follies, which devastate
the world! If you but knew how
my heart has groaned within me,
concealed beneath my gloomy visage,
my exterior as impassible as
my garments, you would understand
how I hate them, these mighty
conquerors, these vile plagues of
the earth, and how I count as nothing
the sack of gold which lies at
the bottom of the precipice over
which they push us, the adroit
fraud that turns them aside from
their course! But shall I weep like
an old woman?” he suddenly exclaimed,
vexed at being betrayed
into the expression of so much
emotion.</p>

<p>Hastily brushing the tear from
his cheek, he began examining the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[618]</a></span>
package of papers, and, instantly recovering
his usual composure, became
M. du Bellay, the diplomate.</p>

<p>Young De Vaux, greatly surprised
at the excess of feeling into which the
ambassador had suddenly been betrayed,
so much at variance with his
previous manner, as well as his rule
of conduct and the rather brusque
reception he had given him, still
remembered it when all thought of
the occurrence had passed from the
mind of his superior.</p>

<p>“Here, sir, read that,” he exclaimed,
throwing the young man a
small scrap of paper.</p>

<p>“I will read it, my lord.”</p>

<p>“Read aloud, sir.”</p>

<p>“‘Cardinal Wolsey, overcome by
grief and alarm, has fallen dangerously
ill. The king has been informed
of it; he has ordered three
physicians to Asher, and obliged
Lady Anne to send him the golden
tablets in token of his reconciliation.
Furthermore, it is certainly true
that the king has said: “I would
not lose Wolsey for twenty thousand
pounds.” It is unnecessary
to impress upon my lord the importance
of this event. My lord
will, I hope, approve of the celerity
with which I have despatched this
information.’”</p>

<p>“It is without signature!” said
De Vaux.</p>

<p>“I credit it entirely,” murmured
Du Bellay.</p>

<p>“By my faith, I am delighted!
These golden tablets afford me extreme
pleasure,” said De Vaux.
“This will revive the hopes of poor
Cardinal Wolsey.”</p>

<p>“And that is all!… And you,
content to know that he is happy,
will remain quietly seated in your
chair, I suppose,” said M. du Bellay,
fixing his green eyes, lighted
with a brilliant gleam, on young De
Vaux. “Monsieur!” he continued,
“it is not in this way a man attends
to the business of his country.
Since the day the cardinal was exiled,
I have deliberated whether I
should go to see him or not. My
heart prompted me to do so, but it
was not my heart I had to consult.
I was persuaded the king would
not be able to dispense with him,
and sooner or later he would be recalled
to the head of affairs. In
that case I felt inclined to give
him a proof of my attachment in
his disgrace. But, on the other
hand, that intriguing family who
are constantly buzzing around the
king induced me constantly to hesitate.
Now I believe we have almost
nothing more to fear; we will
arrive there, perhaps, before the
physicians, and later we shall know
how to proceed.”</p>

<p>“Most willingly!” cried De Vaux.
“I shall be happy indeed to see this
celebrated man, of whom I have
heard so many different opinions.”</p>

<p>“Doubtless,” interrupted Du Bellay
impatiently, “pronounced by
what is styled ‘public opinion’&mdash;a
tribunal composed of the ignorant,
the deluded, and short-sighted, who
always clamor louder than others,
and who take great care, in order to
avoid compromising their stupidity,
to prefix the ominous ‘they say’ to
all their statements. As for me, I
say they invariably display more
hatred toward the virtues they envy
than the vices they pretend to
despise; and they will judge a man
more severely and criticise him
more harshly for the good he has
tried to do than for what he may
have left undone.… Gossiping,
prying crowd, pronouncing judgment
and knowing nothing, who will
cast popularity like a vile mantle
over the shoulders of any man who
will basely stoop low enough before
them to receive it! He who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[619]</a></span>
endeavors to please all pleases
none,” added M. du Bellay, with
a singularly scornful expression.
“To live for his king, and above
all for his country, despising the
blame or hatred of the vulgar,
should be the motto of every public
man; and God grant I may
never cease to remember it!”</p>

<p>“You believe, then, the cardinal
will be restored to the head of affairs?”
asked De Vaux, running his
fingers through his blonde curls,
and rising to depart.</p>

<p>“I am not sure of it yet,” replied
Du Bellay; “we are going to
find out. If the crowd surrounds
him, as eager to pay him homage
to-day as they were yesterday to
overwhelm him with scorn and
contempt; if, in a word, the courtiers
sigh and groan around his
bed, and pretend to feel the deepest
concern, it will be a most certain
indication of his return to favor.
And, to speak frankly, I believe
the king already begins to
discover that no one can replace
the cardinal near his person as
private secretary; for that poor Gardiner
copies a despatch with more
difficulty than his predecessor dictated
one.”</p>

<p>M. du Bellay arose and started, followed
by De Vaux, to the bank of
the Thames, where they entered a
large boat already filled with passengers
awaiting the moment of
departure to ascend the river either
to Chelsea, Battersea, or as far as
Pultney, where the boat stopped.
Bales of merchandise were piled up
in the centre, on which were seated
a number of substantial citizens
conversing together with their
hands in their pockets, and wearing
the self-sufficient air of men
the extent of whose purse and credit
were well understood.</p>

<p>They fixed, at first, a scrutinizing
glance on the new arrivals, and
then resumed their conversation.</p>

<p>“Come, come, let us be off
now!” exclaimed a young man, balancing
himself on one foot. “Here
is half an hour lost, and I declare
I must be at Chelsea to dinner.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, it is already an hour.
Look here! This cockswain doesn’t
resemble our parliament at all; <em>that</em>
does everything it is told to do!”
he added, as he sauntered into the
midst of the crowd.</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue, William,”
immediately replied one of them;
“you don’t recollect any more, I
suppose, the assembly at Bridewell,
where the king, knowing we condemned
his course in the divorce
affair, after having seized all the
arms in the city, told us himself
there was no head so high but he
would make it fall if it attempted
to resist him.”</p>

<p>“What shameful tyranny!” replied
another, rolling a bundle under
his foot. “I cannot think of
it without my blood boiling. Are
these Englishmen he treats in this
manner?”</p>

<p>“And that wicked cardinal,”
continued his neighbor in a loud,
shrill voice&mdash;“he was standing by
the king, and looking at us with his
threatening eyes. He has been
the cause of all the troubles we
have had with this affair. But we
are rid of him, at last.”</p>

<p>“We are rid of him, did you
say?” interrupted a man about fifty
or sixty years of age, who appeared
to be naturally phlegmatic and
thoughtful. “You are very well
contented, it seems to me; … but
it is because you only think
of the present, and give yourself
no concern whatever about the future.
Ah! well, in a few days we
will see if you are as well satisfied.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[620]</a></span></p>

<p>“And why not then?” they all
exclaimed in the same voice.</p>

<p>“Because, I tell you, because …”</p>

<p>“Explain yourself more clearly,
Master Wrilliot,” continued young
William. “You always know what’s
going to happen better than anybody
else.”</p>

<p>“Ah! yes, I know it only too
well, in fact, my young friend,” he
replied, shaking his head ominously;
“and we will very soon learn
to our sorrow that if the favor of
the cardinal costs us dear, his disgrace
will cost us still more. Parliament
is going to remit all the
king’s debts.”</p>

<p>“What! all of his debts? But
Parliament has no right to do
this!” they all exclaimed.</p>

<p>“No; but it will take the right!”
replied Master Wrilliot. “William
will lose half of his wife’s marriage
portion, which, if I mistake not, his
father gave him in royal trust; and
I shall lose fifteen thousand crowns
for which I was foolish enough to
accept the deed of conveyance.”</p>

<p>“Ah! ah! that will be too unjust;
it ought not to be,” they all
repeated.</p>

<p>“Yes,” continued this far-seeing
interlocutor, shaking his head contemptuously,
“the king has no
money to pay us. War has drained
his private treasury, but he nevertheless
draws from it abundant
means to ransom French princes,
who make him believe they will
marry him to that lady Boleyn;
and if you do not believe me, go
ask these Frenchmen who are here
present,” he added, raising his voice,
and casting on MM. du Bellay and
de Vaux a glance of cold, disdainful
wrath.</p>

<p>M. du Bellay had lost nothing
of the conversation; it was held
too near him, and was too openly
hostile for him to feign not to remark
it. Finding himself recognized,
and neither being able to
reply to a positive interrogation nor
to keep silence, he measured in his
turn, very coolly, and without permitting
the least indication of
emotion or anger to appear, the
face and form of his adversary.</p>

<p>“Sir;” he exclaimed, regarding
him steadily, “who are you, and
by what right do you call me to
account? If it is your curiosity
that impels you, it will not be
gratified; if, on the contrary, you
dare seek to insult me, you should
know I will not suffer it. Answer
me!”</p>

<p>“The best you can make of it
will be worth nothing,” replied, with
a loud burst of laughter, a Genoese
merchant who did not recognize
the ambassador, as he sat by the
men who directed the boat. “Forget
your quarrel, gentlemen, and,
instead of disputing, come look at
this beautiful vessel we are just
going to pass. See, she is getting
ready to sail. A fine ship-load!&mdash;a
set of adventurers who go to try
their fortunes in the new world discovered
by one of my countrymen,”
he added with an air of intense
satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Poor Columbus!” replied one
of the citizens, “he experienced
throughout his life that glory does
not give happiness, and envy and
ingratitude united together to crush
his genius. Do you not believe, if
he could have foreseen the cruelties
Hernando Cortez and Pizarro exercised
toward the people whom he
discovered, he would have preferred
leaving the secret of their existence
buried for ever in the bosom of the
stormy sea that bore him to Europe,
rather than to have announced there
the success of his voyage?”</p>

<p>“I believe it,” said Wrilliot, “his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[621]</a></span>
soul was so beautiful! He loved
humanity.”</p>

<p>“Christopher Columbus!” exclaimed
young William, full of
youthful enthusiasm and admiration
for a man whose home was the
ocean. “I cannot hear his name
pronounced without emotion! I always
imagine I see him in that old
convent of Salamanca, before those
learned professors and erudite
monks assembled to listen to a project
which in their opinion was as
rash as it was foolish.</p>

<p>“‘How do you suppose,’ said they,
‘that your vessel will ever reach the
extremity of the Indies, since you
pretend that the earth is round?
You would never be able to return;
for what amount of wind do you
imagine it would require to enable
your ship to remount the liquid
mountain which it had so easily
descended? And do you forget
that no creature can live under the
scorching atmosphere of the torrid
zone?’</p>

<p>“Columbus refuted their arguments;
but these doctors still insisted,
nor hesitated to openly
demand of him how he could be so
presumptuous as to believe, if the
thing had been as he said, it could
have remained undiscovered by so
many illustrious men, born before
him, and who had attained the
highest degree of learning, while for
him alone should have been reserved
the development of this
grand idea.”</p>

<p>“And yet,” said Wrilliot, who
had listened in silence, “it was permitted,
some years later, that he
should go down to the grave wearing
the chains with which his persecutors
had loaded him, in order
to keep him away from the world
that he alone had been able to
discover!”</p>

<p>“What perseverance! What obstacles
he succeeded in overcoming!”
replied one of those who had
first spoken. “I shall always, while
I live, recall with pleasure having
been of service to his brother Bartholomew
when he came to this
country.”</p>

<p>“What! he came here?” repeated
William.</p>

<p>“Yes, and was in my own house,”
continued the citizen. “Christopher,
finding the senate of Genoa
and the King of Portugal refused
equally to listen or furnish him
with vessels necessary for the enterprise
he had so long meditated, sent
his brother to King Henry VII.
He was unfortunately captured, in
coming over, by some pirates, who
kept him in slavery. Many years
elapsed before he succeeded in
escaping and reaching England,
where he found himself reduced to
such a state of destitution that he
was obliged to design charts for a
living, and to enable him to present
himself in decent apparel at court.
The king gave him a favorable
reception, but Christopher, in the
meantime, receiving no intelligence
from his brother, solicited so earnestly
the court of Spain that he obtained
two small vessels from Isabella
of Castile, and very soon after
Europe learned of the existence
of another hemisphere. Spain
planted her standard there, and
we thus lost the advantages which
were destined for us.”</p>

<p>“I do not regret it,” replied an
old man sitting in the midst of the
crowd, who had until that time
maintained a profound silence. “Is
it not better for a nation to be less
rich and powerful than stained with
so many crimes? It is now but
thirty-eight years since Columbus
founded the colony of San Domingo.
This island then contained a
million of inhabitants; to-day there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[622]</a></span>
scarcely remain forty thousand.
But,” pursued the old man with a
bitter smile, “they will not stop
there. No; they will not confine
their barbarous exploits to that
miserable region. They are renewing
in Peru the carnage they carried
on in Mexico. It is necessary to
have a great many places for a man
to die&mdash;to pass a few moments, and
then go and hide himself in the grave!
I have already lived seventy-nine
years, and yet it seems to me now
that my left hand still rests on my
cradle. I can scarcely believe that
these white locks are scattered upon
my head; for my life has sped like
the fleeting dream of a single night
that has passed. Yes, William,”
continued the old man, “you look
at me with astonishment, and your
eyes, full of youthful fire, are fixed
upon mine, in which the light has
long been extinguished. Ah! well,
you will very soon see it extinguished
in your own, but not before you
will have witnessed all their cruelties.”</p>

<p>“That is bad,” replied William.
“But these Indians are stupid and
indolent beyond all parallel;<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> they
will neither work nor pay the taxes
imposed on them.”</p>

<p>“And from whom do the Spaniards
claim the right of reducing
these people to a state of servitude,”
exclaimed the old man indignantly,
“and to treat them like
beasts of burden whom they are
privileged to exterminate with impunity,
and carry off the gold their
avarice covets, the dagger in one
hand, the scourge in the other?
They ensure them, they say, the
happiness of knowing the Christian
religion! How dare they presume
to instruct these people in that
Gospel of peace which commands
us to love our neighbor as ourselves,
to detach our hearts from
the things of the world, and, leaving
our offering before the altar, go and
be reconciled with our enemy?”</p>

<p>“From that point of view your
argument would seem just,” replied
William; “but the fact is, if the
Spaniards did not force these islanders
to work them, the mines
would remain unproductive, the
fields uncultivated, and the colonies
would perish.”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken,” replied the
old man. “In acting as she does
Spain destroys in her own womb
the source from whence she would
draw an immense revenue. If she
had been satisfied to establish an
honest and peaceable commerce
with these countries, her industry,
excited to the highest degree by
the rich commodities of exchange,
would have conferred an incalculable
benefit on an entire people
whom her blind cupidity has induced
her to crush and destroy.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose these isolated
negroes they buy at such enormous
prices will ever be able to replace
the native inhabitants who live and
die in their own country? This
strange and ferocious population
will remain among the colonies, enemies
always ready to revolt; a
yoke of iron and blood will alone
be sufficient to keep them in subjection.
But let these masters
tremble if ever the power falls into
the hands of their slaves!”</p>

<p>MM. du Bellay and de Vaux listened
to this conversation in silence,
and the diversion was at first agreeable;
but they were soon convinced
that they were suddenly becoming
again the objects of general attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[623]</a></span></p>

<p>“I tell you,” exclaimed one,
“they are going to look for the
cardinal and bring him back to
court.”</p>

<p>“Well!” replied another, “I
would like to see M. du Bellay in
the place of the legate Campeggio.”</p>

<p>“Ah! and what have they done
with him, then?” they all eagerly
demanded.</p>

<p>“He was arrested at Dover, where
he had gone to embark. He was
dreadfully alarmed, believing they
came to assassinate him. His baggage
was searched, in order to find
Wolsey’s treasures, with which he
was entrusted, they said, for safe
keeping.”</p>

<p>“And did they find them?” asked
the Genoese merchant, eagerly
leaning forward at the sound of the
word treasure.</p>

<p>“It seems they did not find
them,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Hear what they say!” whispered
young De Vaux in the ear of
M. du Bellay.</p>

<p>“I presume they were in search
of the legal documents, but they
were too late. They have long
ago arrived in Italy. Campeggio
was careful enough to send them
secretly by his <em>son</em> Rudolph.<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> I
often saw this young man in Rome,
and heard him say his father had
entrusted him with all his correspondence
and despatches,<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> as he
was not certain what fate Henry
had in store for him.”</p>

<p>“You say,” replied young William,
elevating his voice in order
that M. du Bellay might hear him,
“that the king has sent the Earl
of Wiltshire to Rome to solicit his
divorce. He had better make all
these strangers leave who come
into our country only to sow discord,
and then gather the fruits of
their villany.”</p>

<p>This speech, although spoken indirectly,
was evidently intended
for the two Frenchmen; but the
Genoese merchant, always inclined
to be suspicious, immediately applied
it to himself.</p>

<p>“Master William,” he exclaimed,
reddening with anger, “have you
forgotten that for twenty years I
have been a commercial friend of
your father. And if he has made his
fortune with our velvets and silks,
to whom does he owe it, if not to
those who, by their honesty and
promptness in fulfilling their engagements,
were the first cause of
his success? Now, because you
are able to live without work, you
take on this insulting manner&mdash;very
insulting indeed. However,
I give you to understand that, if it
suited me to do it, I could make as
great a display of luxury and wealth
as yourself, and can count on my
dresser as many dishes and flagons
of silver as you have; and if it
suited me to remain at home, there
is no necessity for me to travel any
more on business.”</p>

<p>The merchant continued to boast
of his fortune, and William began
to explain that his remarks were
by no means intended for him,
when the passengers began to cry
out: “Land! land! Here is Chelsea;
we land at Chelsea.”</p>

<p>The rowers halted immediately,
and the little boats sent from the
shore came to take off the passengers
who wished to land.</p>

<p>Almost all of them went; none
remaining on the boat except the
ambassador, the Genoese merchant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[624]</a></span>
and two citizens whose retiring
and prudent character could
be read in the quiet, thoughtful expression
of their faces. They gazed
for a long time on the surrounding
country; at last one of them hazarded
the question:</p>

<p>“Do you know who owns that
white house with the terraced garden
extending down to the bank
of the Thames?”</p>

<p>“That is the residence of Sir
Thomas More, the new chancellor,”
replied his companion methodically.</p>

<p>“Ah! it does not make much
show. Do you know this new
chancellor?”</p>

<p>“By my faith, no! However, I
saw him the other day on the square
at Westminster, as I was passing; the
Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk were
conducting him with great ceremony
to the Star Chamber (at least that
is what they told me). I stopped
to look at him. There was an immense
crowd filling all the square.
In crossing it the Duke of Norfolk
stopped, and, turning to the crowd
before him, said the king had instructed
him to publicly proclaim
what great and important services
Sir Thomas had rendered him in
every position he had confided to
his care, and it was on that account
he esteemed him so highly, and
had appointed him now to the
highest position in the kingdom
because of his virtues and the rare
talents he possessed. Everybody
listened and said nothing (because
you know the last is always the
best).” The citizen said this in a
very low tone.</p>

<p>“More replied very well,” he
continued. “He said that, while
deeply grateful for his majesty’s
goodness and favors, he felt no less
deeply convinced that the king had
rewarded him far beyond his merits;
in all he had accomplished he
had but done his duty, and he
greatly feared now that he might
not possess the ability necessary
for acquitting himself of the duties
of so high and important an office.
And&mdash;a very singular thing (for they
do not usually speak of their predecessors)&mdash;he
declared that he could
not rejoice in the honor conferred
on him, as it recalled the name of
the wise and honorable prelate
whom he had superseded. On
hearing that I supposed they would
hiss; but not at all. He said everything
so well, with so much sincerity,
dignity, and firmness, that they
applauded him with an indescribable
enthusiasm. It seemed those who
knew him were never satisfied with
praising him. Nobody, they said,
rendered justice so scrupulously as
he; none were so wise, so disinterested;
in fact, they never ended
the recital of his perfections.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the other, in a voice
scarcely audible, while he looked
round to discover if any one could
hear him, “we will see later if he
performs all these wonderful things,
and if any one will be able to get
near him without paying even his
doorkeeper, as was the case with
the other.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we will see,” replied his
companion. “None of these great
lords are worth much&mdash;any amount
of <em>promises</em>; but of <em>deeds</em>&mdash;nothing!”</p>

<p>“But this is not a great lord,”
answered the citizen.</p>

<p>“Ah! well, it is all the same; as
soon as they rise, they grow proud,
and despise and scorn the people.
You may believe if ever I obtain a
patent of nobility, and become still
richer than I am now, I will crush
them beautifully; there will not be
one who will dare contradict me.
By my faith! it is a great pity I
had not been born a count or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[625]</a></span>
baron; I should have been so well
up to all their impertinences and
want of feeling.”</p>

<p>“It is not very difficult,” replied
his companion; “you are, I think,
sufficiently so now for the good of
that poor youth who wants to marry
your daughter. He will lose his
senses, I am afraid, poor fellow.”</p>

<p>“What did you say, neighbor?”
replied the citizen, feeling the blood
mount to his face. “Do you think
I will give my daughter to a wretch
who has not a cent in the world&mdash;I
who have held in my family the
right of citizenship from time immemorial?
My grandmother also
told me we have had two aldermen
of our name. All that
counts, you see, Master Allicot;
and if you wish to remain my
friend, I advise you not to meddle
yourself with the tattle of my wife
and daughter on the subject of
that little wretch they are putting
it into her head to marry; because,
in truth, the mother is as bad as
the daughter. Ah! neighbor, these
women, these women are the
plagues of our lives! Don’t say
any more to me about it. They
will run me distracted; but they
will make nothing by it, I swear it,
neighbor. The silly jades! to dare
speak to me of such a match!
Hush! don’t say any more to me
about it, neighbor; for it will drive
me mad!”</p>

<p>The neighbor <em>did</em> reply, however,
because he had been commissioned
to use his influence in softening
the husband and father in favor of
a young mechanic full of life and
health, who had no other fault than
that of belonging to a class less
elevated than that of the proud
citizen who rejected his humble
supplications with scorn.</p>

<p>But the <i lang="fr">dénouement</i> of this embassy,
and the termination of this
romance of the warehouse, have
been for ever lost to history; for M.
du Bellay, seeing they were almost
in sight of Asher, made them land
him, and the two honorable citizens
doubtless continued their journey
and their conversation.</p>

<p>At Asher M. du Bellay found
everything just as he expected.
The physicians surrounded Wolsey’s
bed, watching his slightest
movement. The golden tablets of
young Anne Boleyn were thrown
open upon the coarse woollen bedspread
that covered the sick man.
Cromwell walked the floor with
folded arms. He approached the
bed from time to time, looked at
Wolsey, whose closed eyes and labored
breathing betokened nothing
favorable, then at the golden
tablets, then at the physicians
around him. He seemed to say,
“Is he going to die, and just when
he might be so useful to me?”</p>

<p>On seeing M. du Bellay enter,
his countenance lighted up; he ran
on before him, and endeavored to
arouse Wolsey from his stupor.</p>

<p>“My lord, the ambassador of
France!” he cried in the ear of the
dying man.</p>

<p>But he received no reply.</p>

<p>“It is singular,” said the doctors,
“nothing can arouse him.” And
they looked gravely at each other.</p>

<p>“He will not die! I tell you he
will not die!” replied Cromwell,
evincing the most impatient anxiety.</p>

<p>He approached the cardinal and
shook his head.</p>

<p>“Crom&mdash;well,” murmured the
sick man.</p>

<p>“Monsieur du Bellay!” shouted
Cromwell a second time.</p>

<p>Wolsey’s eyes remained closed.</p>

<p>“Let him alone,” cried the physicians;
“he must not be excited.”</p>

<p>“So I think,” said M. du Bellay.
“You can tell him I have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[626]</a></span>
here,” continued the ambassador,
turning towards Cromwell, “but
did not wish to disturb him.”</p>

<p>M. du Bellay then took his leave,
and returned by the land route to
London. He encountered, not far
from Asher, a party of the cardinal’s
old domestics, whom the king had
sent to carry him several wagon-loads
of furniture and other effects.
At the head of this convoy rode
Cavendish, one of the cardinal’s
most faithful servants.</p>

<p>Seeing M. du Bellay, they collected
around him, and hastily inquired
about their master.</p>

<p>Du Bellay advised them to quicken
their speed, and, taking leave,
went on his way, thinking that the
cardinal would not be restored to
favor, and already arranging in his
mind another course in which to
direct his diplomatic steps for the
future.</p>

<p>He was not mistaken: Wolsey
escaped death, but only to find himself
surrounded by misery and
abandoned to despair.</p>

<h3>PRIMITIVE CIVILIZATION.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></h3>

<p>If our modern men of science
would not travel out of their sphere,
there would be no war between
them and the church. In the name
of the Catholic religion we invite
them to push onward in the path
of scientific discovery with the utmost
energy and ardor of which
they are capable. But if their discoveries
are to have any bearing on
the truths of the Christian revelation,
we can accept nothing less
than demonstration, and they must
not credit science, as does Mr. Tyndall,
with mere theories of speculative
philosophy. With this reservation,
we wish their labors all possible
success. But if poor fallible reason&mdash;whose
discoveries, after whole
millenniums of toil, are little better
than a record of the blunders of one
generation corrected by the blunders
of another; and, even on the
supposition that they are all correct, are, by comparison with what
is unknown, as a drop of water
compared with the limitless ocean&mdash;ventures
to deny the existence of
the soul because it has no lens
powerful enough to bring it within
the cognizance of the senses, its
conclusion is no longer scientific.
The doctor has become a quack,
the philosopher a fool. If the torch
which the Creator has placed at the
service of his creature, to help him
to grope his way amidst the objects
of sense, and to illuminate his faith,
is to be flung in his face because it
does not reveal the whole infinitude
of the majesty of his beauty,
we can only compassionate so
childish a misuse of a noble gift.
If natural philosophy is to rob the
sensible creation of a motive and
end, and to proclaim it to be merely
the result of an unintelligent atomic
attraction and evolution of forces,
a more intelligent and a more logical
philosophy, in harmony with
the unquenchable instinct of immortality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[627]</a></span>
within the human soul,
casts from it such pitiful trifling
with indignation and a holy disdain.
If, in short, the science of
nature would dethrone nature’s
Creator and God, we address to it
the word which He to whom all
true science leads addressed to the
ocean he placed in the deep hollows
of the earth: “Hitherto thou shalt
come, and thou shalt go no farther:
and here thou shalt break
thy swelling waves.”</p>

<p>Physical science cannot contradict
the divine revelation. No
discovery hitherto made has done
so; and until one such presents
itself we are entitled to assume its
impossibility as a philosophical
axiom. For this reason we are of
those who would give full rein to
even the speculations of experimental
philosophy, so long as they
are confined strictly within the domain
of secondary causes or natural
law, and do not venture into a
sphere of thought beyond the reach
of experimental science, where they
are immediately confronted with
the dogmas of the faith.</p>

<p>We have never thought that the
theory of the evolution of species
must of necessity transgress that
limit. It has been made to do so
by <i lang="la">philosophuli</i>, if we may invent a
name for them&mdash;speculative bigots,
who are bent on extorting from
natural phenomena any plausible
support of the infidel prejudices of
which they were previously possessed.
A more intelligent observation
of scientific facts would
have saved them from a ridiculous
extravagance which makes them
resemble those afflicted creatures,
whom we so often meet with in asylums
for the insane, who suppose
themselves to be God.</p>

<p>We must never lose sight of the
fact that God can only communicate
with his creature in such a
way as he can understand. If he
were to reveal himself to any of us
as he is, we should die, unless he
supplied us with a miraculous capacity
for supporting the vision.
If he had inspired the historian of
those primitive ages to describe the
astronomical phenomenon which
happened in the time of Joshua in
the exact language of physical
science, what meaning would it
have conveyed to people who did
not know that the earth revolves
around its own axis and around the
sun? If it be objected, Why did
not the Holy Spirit use language
consistent with scientific truth, and
leave it to be understood afterwards
in the progress of science? we reply,
Because it would have thwarted his
own designs to have done so. The
Bible is a book of instruction in
truth out of the reach of human intelligence,
not a book of natural
science; and it appeals to the obedience
of faith rather than to reason.
The mental toil of scientific
discovery was a part of the punishment
inflicted on the original transgression.
To anticipate the result
of that toil by thousands of years
would have been to contradict His
own dispensation.</p>

<p>In the same manner the sublime
record of the genesis of the illimitable
universe which weaves its
dance of light in space is told in a
few sentences: The fiat of Him
with whom one day is as a thousand
years, and a thousand years as one
day, and the successive order of the
creation&mdash;that is all. Time was
not then, for it was the creation
of time. Man can conceive no
ideas independent of time, and
so days are named; but it is evident
that the word may stand for
indeterminate periods of time. The
creation of light was, it cannot be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[628]</a></span>
doubted, instantaneous. But that
creation was a law&mdash;limitation, relation,
succession&mdash;whose working
was an evolution in successive orders
or stages, over which presided the
Creator, and still presides. “My
Father worketh hitherto, and I
work.” Each of these was a
distinct creation, perfect in itself,
not an evolution of species. The
creation was progressive, but not
in the sense of the creation of every
one of its six cycles evolving out of
the preceding one; for in that
case either the lower would have
disappeared or the evolution would
be still in operation. The firmament
did not develop out of light,
nor the ocean and the dry land out
of the firmament; nor were the
fishes an evolution from the sea-weed,
nor the birds from the trees
and shrubs, nor the wild beasts from
the reeds of the jungle, nor man from
the lower animals. But they were
all to be made before his creation
who was the sum and end of all;
and the atmosphere must be created
before the birds, the ocean before
the fishes, the dry land before vegetable
life.</p>

<p>And not only was there never
any evolution of species into other
species, but the creation of every
separate species was complete, so
that there has never been an evolution
of any species into a higher
state or condition. There has
never been any progress in that
sense. Every species, including
the human being, remains precisely
as it issued from the hand of God,
when it has not degenerated or disappeared.
Indeed, the tendency of
all living things around us is to
degeneracy and decay. Whatever
progress can be predicated of man is
of his moral nature only, and of his
knowledge, through the divine revelation.
But even that is not a race
progress, an evolution of species,
but an individual one. If this be
conceded&mdash;and we think it scarcely
admits of dispute&mdash;we see no danger
to the dogmas of the faith in allowing
to the natural philosophers any
length of ages they may claim for
the creation of the home of man
before he was called into being for
whom it was destined.</p>

<p>Whatever period of time was
covered by those cycles of creation,
throughout them it may be said
that he was being made. If all was
for him and to end in him, it was
in effect he who all along was being
made. Yet the whole was only a
preparatory creation. It was only
his body in which all resulted. “A
body thou hast prepared for me.”
It was when “God breathed into
his nostrils the breath of life” that
man was created. It was then he
became “a living soul.”</p>

<p>The error of the physicists
who reject revelation is threefold.
They make the body the man;
they thus assign to his body and
the inner principle which animates
it a simultaneous beginning and
joint development, some of them
going so far as to make the spirit
itself, or soul, or whatever they call
the animating principle, the spontaneous
product of material forces.
And, throwing back the beginning
of the evolution process into untold
ages, by comparison with
which the life of an individual is a
scarcely appreciable moment, they
suppose the process to be still going
on as it begun. All this obviously
contradicts the direct statements
of revelation. It is, indeed,
shocking to mere human reason.
The work of the natural creation ended
with the sixth day. Up to that
time, whether the periods were
long or short, the work was going
on. But it was complete when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[629]</a></span>
body which had been prepared for
him was animated with the spirit of
life. After that there was no farther
development. It is contrary to reason
to suppose it. It is contrary to
the whole analogy of nature. Not
an instance can be adduced, throughout
the entire creation, of one
species developing into another&mdash;not
an instance even of any species
developing within itself into a higher
order of being. But up to that
period, of which it is thus written,
<i lang="la">Igitur <span class="smcapuc">PERFECTI SUNT</span> cœli et terra, et
omnis ornatus eorum: <span class="smcapuc">COMPLEVITQUE</span>
Deus die septimo opus suum quod
fecerat; et requievit die septimo ab
uni verso opere quod patrarat</i>, we may
admit, without risk of heterodoxy,
any doctrine of evolution of which
the physicists may give us a satisfactory
evidence.</p>

<p>The physicists, in support of their
irrational theory of evolution, maintain
that the earliest developments
of human consciousness were of the
lowest order, and that man has ever
since been gradually progressing
towards a higher morality and loftier
spheres of thought. In this
able and interesting work Father
Thébaud demonstrates, by an exhaustive
induction from the history
and literature of all the nations,
that the history of mankind up to
the coming of Christ, instead of a
progress, was a continual retrogression.</p>

<p>In his introductory chapter he
establishes, by proofs which should
be conclusive to all minds unprepossessed
by an arrogant perversity,
that primitive man was in possession
of a primitive revelation. In
the morning twilight of the ages, as
far back as we can see across the
Flood, up to the very cherubim-guarded
entrance to the seats of
innocence from which the erring
creature had been driven, he traces
everywhere those rites and dogmas,
in their elemental form, which, in
their complete development and
full significance, made known to us
by the revelation of the fulness of
time, are still of faith and observance
amongst the sons of God
from end to end of the habitable
globe. This revelation did not go
beyond monotheism, because the
fallen immortal had to be prepared,
through long ages of discipline, for
the revelation of the triune nature
of the Godhead, and of his restoration
to the forfeited favor of his
Father by the incarnation and atoning
sacrifice of the Eternal Son.
We do not remember to have met
before with the ingenious hypothesis<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>
that the configuration of the
earth, consisting of an all-embracing
ocean, in the midst of which
vast continents are islands, evidences
the design of the Creator to
have been that “men should have
intercourse of some kind with one
another,” and that on the land.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The oceans and rivers, instead of being
primarily dividing lines, intended to
separate men from one another, had precisely
for their first object to become
highways and common channels of intercourse
between the various nations of
mankind.”</p>

</div>

<p>But our author considers that
the social intercommunion to which
the configuration of the earth was
to administer was not to develop
in the form of “an universal republic,”
but that “men were to consent
to exist in larger or smaller groups,
each of them surrounded with well-defined
limits determining numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[630]</a></span>
nationalities,” united in the bond of
religious uniformity which he terms
patriarchal Catholicity.</p>

<p>The design of the Creator of
universal brotherhood amongst his
creatures was not to be fulfilled before
the lapse of ages, and throughout
that dismal period it has the
appearance of being perpetually
thwarted by their perverseness. The
memories of Paradise rapidly faded
away amongst them. After what
period of time we are not told, the
sons of God committed a second
infidelity by intermarrying with the
daughters of men. The result was
a race of giants&mdash;giants in capacity
and crime as well as in bodily form&mdash;whose
existence universal tradition
attests. In almost open alliance
with the powers of darkness,
they sank with such fearful rapidity
down the abyss of depravation,
dragging with them the better portion
of the race, that, to avert the
triumph of hell and the utter reprobation
of his creature, the offended
Creator buried the guilty memories
of colossal crime beneath an universal
deluge, at whose subsidence the
first civilization reappeared on the
mountains of Asia in all its earliest
purity, brought across the forty
days’ extinction of life upon the
earth by the eight souls who alone
had turned a deaf ear to the universal
seduction. “This idea of a
gradual and deeper degradation of
human kind,” says Frederick Schlegel,
“in each succeeding age, appears
at first sight not to accord
very well with the testimony which
sacred tradition furnishes on man’s
primitive state, for it represents
the two races of the primitive
world as contemporary; and, indeed,
Seth, the progenitor of the better
and nobler race of virtuous patriarchs,
was much younger than
Cain. However, this contradiction
is only apparent, if we reflect that
it was the wicked and violent race
which drew the other into its disorders,
and that it was from this
contamination a giant corruption
sprang, which continually increased,
till, with a trifling exception, it
pervaded the whole mass of mankind,
and till the justice of God required
the extirpation of degenerate
humanity by one universal
flood.”</p>

<p>It does not admit of a moment’s
doubt, as our author argues, that
with this terrible judgment began
the dissolution of that fraternal
unity which God had intended
should be the happy lot of the human
family, and for which the configuration
of the earth was adapted.
The gigantic unity of crime was
smitten to pieces in the helplessness
of division. They who had been
brothers looked in one another’s
faces and found them strange.
They opened their lips, and, lo!
their speech was to others a jargon
of unintelligible sounds. The one
could no more understand the
other than they could the wolf or
the jackal with whom they both
began to be mutually classed. The
intercommunion of families of men
with one another was rudely snapped
asunder. There were no means
of common action, there was no
medium of common thought. The
fragments into which the human
family were smitten went off in
different directions, to post themselves,
in attitudes of mutual distrust
and defiance, behind mountains
or morasses, on the skirts
of forests, the borders of torrents,
or in the security of measureless
deserts, where their practised eyes
swept the horizon. Intercommunion
was rendered still more impossible
by the mutual antagonism,
fear, and hatred that prevailed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[631]</a></span>
And the very ocean, instead of being
a pathway for the interchange of
social life, became a formidable
barrier between man and man.
The dangers to be encountered on
the lands to which the winds might
bear them were more to be dreaded
than the terrible phantoms which,
issuing ever and anon from the
home of the storms, raged across
the ocean, and lashed into merciless
fury its roaring waves. Memory
had lost, in the primeval language,
the key of its treasure-house. As
years went on, amidst the exacting
preoccupations of new ways of life,
new surroundings, new ways of expressing
their thoughts, and their
increasing tribal or race isolation,
the ideas upon which their primeval
civilization had been based grew
dimmer and dimmer, until they
finally disappeared.</p>

<p>“To establish this in detail,”
says the author of <cite>Gentilism</cite>, “is the
purpose of this work.” And this
purpose appears to us to have been
accomplished in the most convincing
manner.</p>

<p>The scientists maintain, and it is
necessary to their evolution theory,
that man began with barbarism, and
moved slowly onwards in the gradual
stages of their tedious evolution
process towards what they call
civilization, which is to lead, we
believe, in the future developments
of the ever-continuing evolution, to
some loftier state and condition,
of the nature of which they supply
us with not the faintest idea.</p>

<p>This notion of the original barbarism
of man is one of those fallacies
which get imbedded in the
general belief of mankind one
knows not how. Strange to say, it
has been very generally acquiesced
in for no manner of reason; and
it is only of late years that thoughtful
men, outside of the faith, have
come to suspect that it is not quite
the truism they had imagined.</p>

<p>There is a reason for this: The
attenuation of the claims of another
world on the every-day life and on
the conduct of men effected by the
great revolt of the XVIth century,
and the keener relish for the things
of this life which consequently ensued,
have infected the sentiments
of mankind with an exaggerated
sense of the importance of material
objects and pursuits. Thus the idea
of civilization, instead of being that
of the highest development of the
moral and whole inner being of social
man, is limited to the discovery
of all the unnumbered ways and
means of administering to the embellishment
and luxury of his actual
life. His very mental progress, as
they term it with extraordinary incorrectness,
is only regarded in this
light.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The speculators on the stone, bronze,
and iron ages,” writes our author, “place
civilization almost exclusively in the enjoyment
by man of a multitude of little
inventions of his own, many of which
certainly are derived from the knowledge
and use of metals. Any nation deprived
of them cannot be called civilized in their
opinion, because reduced to a very simple
state of life, which, they say unhesitatingly,
is barbarism.… Barbarism,
in fact, depends much more on moral
degradation than on physical want of
comfort. And when we come to describe
patriarchal society, our readers will understand
how a tribe or nation may deserve
to be placed on an exalted round
of the social ladder, although living exclusively
on the fruits of the earth, and
cultivating it with a simple wooden
plough.”<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Father Thébaud next proceeds,
with convincing force, to demolish
the argument in behalf of the gradual
evolution of the entire race from
a state of barbarism, which the evolutionists
allege to have been inevitably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[632]</a></span>
its first stage of intellectual consciousness
drawn from the discovery
of human skeletons in caves, and in
the drift of long past ages, in juxtaposition
with instruments of rude
construction belonging to the palæolithic
age and fossil remains of
extinct animals. This argument
has always appeared to us so feeble
as to seem a mystery how it could
be employed by learned men, unless
in support of some preconceived
opinion which they would maintain
at all hazards. The occasional
outbreaks of the Mississippi, the
terrible devastation effected by the
mere overflow of the Garonne in the
South of France, give but a faint
idea of what changes must have
been effected upon the crust of the
earth by the subsidence of the huge
mass of water, which must have
been at least eight or nine times as
ponderous as all the oceans which
have since lain at peace in its hollows.
As the prodigious volumes
of water, sucked and drawn hither
and thither, as they hurried to
their mountain-bed, rushed in furious
tides and vast whirlpools of terrific
force, they must have torn up the
earth’s crust like a rotten rag.
Whole valleys must have been
scooped out down to the very root
of the mountains, and <i lang="fr">débris</i> of all
kinds deposited everywhere in all
kinds of confusion, so as to afford
no secure data whatever for chronological,
or zoölogical, or geological
deductions.</p>

<p>Still more conclusive is Father
Thébaud’s refutation of the argument
in behalf of the evolution
theory drawn from the discovery of
stone implements of rude construction
in what is asserted to be the
earliest drift deposit of iron in the later
strata, and bronze in the latest.
To make this argument of any force
it must be proved that these periods
evolved regularly and invariably
from one another throughout the
whole race of mankind. Their
<em>periodicity</em>, as Father Thébaud has
it, must be indisputably proved.
But this is just what it cannot be.
On the contrary,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In this last age in which we live; in
the previous ages, which we can know
by clear and unobjectionable history;
finally, in the dimmest ages of antiquity
of which we possess any sufficiently reliable
records, the three ‘periods’ of stone,
bronze, and iron have always subsisted
simultaneously, and consequently are no
more ‘periods’ when we speak of the
aggregate of mankind, but they are only
three co-existing aspects of the same specific
individual.”<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

</div>

<p>To the same effect is the argument
that</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The artistic distance between the
rough palæolithic flints and the polished
stones of the neolithic period exhibits a
gap which tells but indifferently in favor
of the believers in continuous progress.
Either there has been a strange severment
of continuity, or the men of the
first period were better artists, and not
such rough barbarians as the remains we
possess of them seem to attest.”</p>

</div>

<p>The scientific arguments, however,
of Father Thébaud, in disproof
of the alleged original barbarism
of the human race, satisfactory
as they are, as far as they go, are little
more than introductory to the more
conclusive historical argument which
constitutes the body of his valuable
and very opportune work.
“The best efforts to ascertain the
origin of man,” he justly remarks,
“or primeval religion, by the facts of
geology or zoölogy, can at best only
result in more or less probable conjectures.”</p>

<p>In an argument of this nature
our author begins, as was to have
been expected, from that philosophical,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[633]</a></span>
impassive, and ancient people
who inhabit the triangular peninsula
which stretches out from no
vast distance from the original seat
of the renewed race of man into
the Southeastern Atlantic. There
they have dwelt from times beyond
which history does not reach. Inheriting
a civilization which dates
from the subsiding Deluge, whose
gradual decadence can be distinctly
traced, they are in possession of
the earliest writings that exist, unless
the books of Moses or the
book of Job are older, which, we do
not think it is rash to say, is, at
least, doubtful. We find ourselves
in the presence of the noblest truths
of even supernatural religion, mingled,
it is true, with the gross pantheistical
absurdities which had already
begun to deface the primitive
revelation and to deteriorate
the primitive civilization.</p>

<p>The general process throughout
the world was, no doubt, as Father
Thébaud describes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“After a period of universal monotheism,
the nations began to worship ‘the
works of God,’ and fell generally into a
broad pantheism. They took subsequently
a second step, perfectly well
marked, later on, in Hindostan, Central
Asia, Egypt, Greece, etc.&mdash;a step originating
everywhere in the imagination of
poets, materializing God, bringing him
down to human nature and weakness,
and finally idealizing and deifying his
supposed representations in statuary
and painting.”<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

</div>

<p>But we must venture to differ
from Father Thébaud as to the
religion of the Hindoos having ever
taken the latter step. The form
its pantheism took, in consequence
of its tenets of the incarnations of
Vishnu&mdash;the second god of the triad&mdash;and
of metempsychosis, was a
worship of animals, and especially of
the cow&mdash;a worship which prevails
to this day. But this was not the
gross idolatry of the Greeks and
Romans, but rather a respect, a
<i lang="la">cultus</i>, in consequence of the supposed
<em>possible</em> presence in the former
of departed friends, and of the
incarnation of the divinity in the
latter. Their idols are huge material
representations of the might
and repose which are the chief attributes
of the Hindoo deity, or of
animals with which the above-named
ideas were especially associated;
but we do not think they ever were
worshipped as was, for example
Diana by the Ephesians.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, it in no way
affects the incontrovertible testimony
which Father Thébaud adduces
to the high state of civilization of
this remarkable people fifteen hundred
years, at all events, before
Christ. He proves it from their
social institutions, which issued
from a kind of tribal municipality
closely resembling the Celtic clans,
but without the principle of superseding
the rightful heir to a deceased
<i lang="ga">canfinny</i> by another son in consequence
of certain disqualifications,
and that of the ever-recurring
redistribution of land, which were
the bane of Celtic institutions. The
caste restrictions, our author shows
from the laws of Menu, were not
nearly so rigorous in those primitive
ages; and from the same source he
exhibits undeniable proof of that
purity of morals which evidences the
highest stage of civilization, and
which has sunk gradually down to
the vicious barbarism of the present
day. We suspect, however, that
this latter has been somewhat exaggerated.
It is certainly our impression,
taken from works written
by those who have lived for years
in familiar intercourse with the
people, that amongst the Hindoo
women there still lingers conspicuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[634]</a></span>
evidence of the purity of morals
which was universal amongst them
in the beginning of their history.</p>

<p>It might have been added, moreover,
that the laws of Menu, in addition
to their high morality, display
a knowledge of finance and
political economy, of the science
of government, and of the art of
developing the resources of a people
which indicate a very high state of
civilization indeed.</p>

<p>It is impossible for us, within the
limits assigned us, to follow Father
Thébaud through an argument consisting
exclusively of learned detail.
Our readers, if they would
have any proper appreciation of it,
must consult the work itself. We
remark merely that, starting from
the admitted fact that the Vedas
contain the doctrine of plain and
pure monotheism, and that in those
distant ages “doctrines were promulgated
and believed in” “which
far transcend all the most solemn
teaching of the greatest philosophers
who flourished in the following
ages, and which yield only to the
sublime and exquisitely refined
teachings of Incarnate Wisdom,”<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>
our author traces the inroads of pantheism
from the time when the doctrine,
recently revived by men once
Christians, of an “universal soul”
was openly proclaimed, and “when
it was asserted that our own is a
‘spark’ from the ‘blazing fire,’
that God is ‘all beings,’ and ‘all
beings are God.’”<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> And he traces
elaborately the change through the
several mystical works of the philosophical
Brahmins subsequent to
the Vedas. Buddhism is a comparatively
modern development.
We doubt its being any form of
Hindooism whatever. It appears
to us to be rather the earliest development
of that spirit of hostility
to the life-giving truths of the Christian
revelation which began its
work almost at their very cradle&mdash;that
abject principle of materialism
which, after having dragged down
the vast populations of China and
of North and Western India to the
lowest depths of mental and moral
degradation of which human nature
is susceptible, is now sweeping over
Christendom, and threatening to
“deceive,” if it were possible,
“even the very elect.”</p>

<p>Father Thébaud’s next chapter
is devoted to a historical review of
the primeval religion and its decline
in Central Asia and Africa.
And here the proof is more overwhelming,
if possible, than in the
case of India. As to the monotheism
of the great Doctor&mdash;if we
may give him such a title&mdash;of the
ancient East, and of the Zends,
there can be no manner of doubt.
Nay, “even the doctrine of the resurrection
of the body is clearly
contained in the most authentic
part of the Zend-Avesta.” There
is also that august personage, apart
from all superior beings under God,
“who stands between God and
man; shows the way to heaven,
and pronounces judgment upon
human actions after death; guards
with his drawn sword the whole
world against the demons; has his
own light from inside, and from
outside is decorated with stars.”
Our author makes Zoroaster, at the
latest, a contemporary of Moses,
and justly observes that the Zend-Avesta
“represents the thoughts of
men very near the origin of our
species.” Now, the magnificent
eloquence and profound truth of
the thoughts we meet, rivalling at
times the Book of Job, the beauty
of the prayers, and the elaborate
splendor of the ritual, testify to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[635]</a></span>
very different state of things in
those earliest days from that alleged
by the evolutionists. Father
Thébaud decides the Zends to be
Vedic, and not Persian. And no
doubt in the remarkable form and
construction of the poems&mdash;dramatic,
and mostly in the form of
dialogue&mdash;in the tone of thought
and leading religious ideas, they
closely resemble the Hindoo Vedas.
But it is our impression that
we do not find in the writings of
Zoroaster that perpetual insistence
on the necessity of absorption into
the deity which characterizes the
Hindoo poems&mdash;the <cite>Bhagavât-Gita</cite>,
for example. It would appear that
the Persians occupied a special
place in the dispensation of God
in the ancient world. The Holy
Spirit, in the prophecies, speaks of
“my servant Cyrus whom I have
chosen,” and it is certain that
the pure monotheistic worship
was preserved longer in Persia
than in any nation of antiquity,
except the Jewish. Its corruption
was into dualism, by which
the spirit of evil, as in the Indian
<cite>Trimourti</cite>, was invested with almost
co-ordinate power with the
spirit of good. But for full information
on this important and interesting
subject we must refer the
reader to Father Thébaud himself.</p>

<p>Our limits do not admit of our
giving scarcely the faintest outline
of our author’s argument in proof
of the monotheism of Pelasgic
Greece, and its gradual degradation
to a sensual and idolatrous anthropomorphism
in Hellenic and
Heroic Greece. The substantial
genuineness of the Orphic literature
he successfully establishes, as well
as the similarity of its doctrines to
those of the Vedas; from which
he draws the obvious inference that
the two came from the same
source, and that that branch of
the Aryan family carried with them
to their more distant settlements
traditions of the primitive revelation
so conspicuous in the Persian
and Hindoo mystic epics, but much
defaced and distorted in the course
of their long and toilsome migrations.
If <em>pure</em> monotheism ever
prevailed in Pelasgic Greece, its
reign was short. Indeed, to Orpheus
himself are ascribed pantheistic
doctrines. It was the poets
who ushered in that special form
of idolatry which took possession
of Greece, the worship of the human
being deified with all his infirmities&mdash;the
<em>anthropomorphism</em> of
the gods, as Father Thébaud calls
it. And the chief sinner, on this
score, was Homer, the first and
greatest of them all. Yet did that
densely-populated, unseen world of
the Greeks&mdash;that sensuous, nay vicious,
idolatry&mdash;which peopled the
ocean and the mountains and the
forests with gods, and imagined a
divinity for every fountain, and
every grove, and every valley, and
every rill, with its superior deities,
up to the supreme father of Olympus,
himself subject to that forlorn
solution of the riddle of “evil”&mdash;fate&mdash;bear
witness from Olympus,
and from Hades, and from the
realms of the sea, to the primitive revelation.
It bore witness to a civilization
from which that degradation
of the ideas of God to the level of
humanity, in spite of its artistic grace
and poetic feeling, deformed, however,
by a filthy lasciviousness, with
its short period of literary splendor
and of exalted philosophy, ending
with the sophistical negations of
scepticism, was a fall, and not a
progress.</p>

<p>For all this, “the precious fragments
of a primitive revelation are
found,” as Father Thébaud truly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[636]</a></span>
observes, “scattered through the
writings of nearly all ancient Greek
and Latin philosophers and poets.”
His two chapters on this subject&mdash;chapter
vii. on “Hellenic Philosophy
as a Channel of Tradition,”
and chapter viii. on “The Greek
and Latin Poets as Guardians of
Truth”&mdash;are perhaps the most interesting
part of his most interesting
and instructive work. They embrace
a subject which has always
appeared to us as more worthy of
learned labor than any other which
could be named. That life would
be well spent which should devote
itself to collecting all these fragments
of traditionary truth from all
ante-Christian literatures. Such a
work would not turn back the flood
of rationalism, whose first risings
we owe to Greece&mdash;for it is rather
moral than intellectual&mdash;but it would
materially obstruct it, and would
rescue from it many souls which
might otherwise be lured to their
destruction by the feeble echoes
of the sophists and Aristophanes,
which, beginning with Voltaire, are
now multiplying through all the
rationalistic press of the world.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we cordially commend
Father Thébaud’s work on
<cite>Gentilism</cite> to the attentive study of
all who wish for solid information
and sagacious criticism on a subject
which appears to us, without
wishing in the least to underrate
scientific investigation, to be more
interesting and more important
than all or any of the discoveries
of physical science. These, as has
been proved of late years, may be
turned against the truth, and become
thus a means of darkening
instead of enlightening the soul.
At the best, be they correct or erroneous,
great or small, many or few,
they cannot add an inch to our
stature or a day to our lives.
They do not even add to our happiness.</p>

<p>But a false science&mdash;one which
would assign to each of us an insignificant
phenomenal existence,
whose individuality will disappear,
at the end of its few days of living
consciousness, in an universal whole
in an eternal state of progress&mdash;is
as fatal to human happiness as anything
can be short of the abyss of
reprobation. More consoling, as
it is more in accordance with right
reason, is the testimony which
comes to us trumpet-tongued, in
one vast unison, from all the ages,
that the history of the race is one
of decadence, not of progress. The
sentence passed was death. The
road to death is decadence. The
way is rounded; there is a movement
onward and a growth of life
until the descent begins which
lands us in dissolution. But every
moment from the first cry of infancy
is a step nearer to death; we
are every one of us dying every
day; and a movement towards
death is not progress. Individual
experience joins its voice to that
of universal history in testimony
of this. The revelation of Christ
has put us in possession of the
highest and certain truth; it has
given us a more exalted moral, and
has recast our nature in a higher,
nay, in a divine, mould. We are
still dying every day; but the certain
hope of a joyful resurrection
has deprived death of its agonizing
sting, and made it, like sleep, a
source of happiness instead of despair.
But this is nothing like the
progress of which the sceptics prate.
It is a supernatural stage in the dispensation
of God for the renewal
of his fallen creature, predetermined
before all time. His own part in
it&mdash;the natural order&mdash;is one long
history of decadence. There has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[637]</a></span>
been the ebb and flow, the rising to
fall, of all movement. But decadence
has all along triumphed over
progress. Amidst what a decadence
are we now living from the
promising progress of the middle
ages! And we are bid to expect
so terrific a retrogression before the
consummation of all things, that
“even the elect shall scarcely be
saved.”</p>

<p>It is the witness of all the ages&mdash;human
progress ebbing and flowing&mdash;but,
on the whole, the flow does
not overtake the ebb. The ocean
of life has been ever ebbing into its
eternal abysses, and will ebb, leaving
behind it a dry and barren waste,
until the morning of eternity shall
break over the withdrawing night of
time, chaos shall be for ever sealed
in the confusion and sadness of its
darkness, and the final word shall
go forth, of which the sublime physical
law was only a type and a
shadow: “Let there be light!”</p>

<h3>MADAME’S EXPERIMENT.<br />
<span class="smaller">A SAINT AGNES’ EVE STORY.</span></h3>

<p class="center">“MY THOUGHTS ARE NOT YOUR THOUGHTS, NOR YOUR WAYS MY WAYS, SAITH THE LORD.”</p>

<p>Madame the Countess of Hohenstein
stood at the window of the
great hall of her palace, waiting for
the coach which was to take her
to a <i lang="fr">château</i> some leagues distant,
where she was to grace a grand entertainment,
and to be kept for a
whole night by her hosts as an especial
treasure. For Madame the
Countess of Hohenstein, spite of
her sixty years and her three grown
sons, was a famous beauty still and
a brilliant conversationist, and few
were her rivals, young or old,
throughout the kingdom. But her
face was clouded as she waited in
her stately hall that January afternoon,
and she listened with a pained
expression to the sound of a footstep
overhead pacing steadily up
and down. She touched a bell presently.</p>

<p>“Tell your master,” she said to
the servant who answered it, “that
I wish to see him again before I
leave.” And soon down the winding
stairway she watched a young man
come with the same steady pace
which might have been heard overhead
for a half-hour past.</p>

<p>No need to ask the relationship
between the two. Black, waving
hair, broad brow, set lips, firm chin,
the perfect contour of the handsome
face&mdash;all these were the son’s
heritage of remarkable beauty from
his queenly mother; but the headstrong
pride and excessive love
which shone from her eyes as he
came in sight met eyes very different
from them. Large and black
indeed they were, but their intense
look, however deep the passion it
bespoke, told of an unearthly passion
and a fire that is divine.</p>

<p>“Ah! Heinrich love,” his mother
said, “once more, come with me.”</p>

<p>“Nay, little mother,” he answered&mdash;the
caressing diminutive sounding
strangely as addressed to her
in her pomp of attire and stately
presence&mdash;“you said I need not
go; that you did not care for me
at the baron’s.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[638]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not so, Heinrich. I care for
you everywhere, everywhere. I
am lost without you, love of my
soul. But I know you hate it, and,
if you must stay from any place,
better that than some others. There
are no maidens there I care for,
my son.”</p>

<p>She watched the calm forehead
contract as she spoke. “There!
as ever,” she exclaimed. “Wilt
never hear woman mentioned without
a frown? You are no monk
yet, child, at your twentieth year;
nor ever shall be, if I can help it.
It is enough for me, surely, to have
given two sons to the priesthood,
without yielding up my last one, my
hope and my pride.”</p>

<p>Heinrich made no answer, for
the sound of the carriage-wheels
was heard, and he offered his mother
his hand, led her down the
steps, and placed her in the coach.
She drew him towards her, and
kissed him passionately. “Farewell,
my dearest,” she said. “I
count the minutes till we meet
again.” And she never ceased to
watch him as long as the mansion
was visible.</p>

<p>He was a sight of which many a
mother might have been proud, as he
stood there bare headed, the winter
sun lighting his face, the winter
wind lifting his dark locks, the fresh
bloom of youth enhancing his peculiar
beauty. His mother sighed
deeply as the coach turned a corner
which hid him from her view&mdash;a
sigh often repeated during the
course of her journey.</p>

<p>It was a full hour before she was
out of her own domains, though
the horses sped swiftly over the
frozen ground. All those broad
acres, all that noble woodland, all
those peasant homes, were hers;
and for miles behind her the land
stretching north and west belonged
with it, for she had married the
owner of the next estate, and, widowed,
held it for her son. But at
her death all these possessions must
be divided among distant unknown
kinsmen, if Heinrich persisted in
the desire, which had been his from
early boyhood, to become a monk.
His mother’s whole heart was set
against it. Her aim in life was to
find for him a wife whom he would
love, and whom he would bring to
their home; she longed to hold before
her death her son’s son on her
knee.</p>

<p>The coach stopped as the sun
was setting; and at the palace
door, too eager for a sight of her
to wait in courtly etiquette within,
host and hostess stood ready to
greet this friend of a lifetime.</p>

<p>“No Heinrich?” they cried,
laughing. “A truant always. And
we have that with us to-day which
will make you wish him here. No
matter what! You will see in
time.”</p>

<p>And in time she saw indeed.
Going slowly up the marble stairs
a half-hour later, a vision of magnificent
beauty, with her ermine
mantle wrapped about her, the
hood fallen back from her regal
head, the eyes with the pained look
of disappointment and longing still
lingering in them in spite of the
loving welcomes lavished upon her,
she came, in a turn of the stairs,
upon another vision of beauty radiant
as her own, and extremely
opposite.</p>

<p>Coming slowly down towards her
was a young girl, tall and slight,
with a skin of dazzling fairness,
where the blue veins in temple and
neck were plain to see; a delicate
tint like blush-roses upon the
cheek; great waves of fair hair
sending back a glint of gold to the
torches just lighted in the hall;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[639]</a></span>
eyes very large, and so deeply set
that at first their violet blue seemed
black&mdash;eyes meek and downcast,
and tender as a dove’s, but in
them, too, a look of pain and yearning.
The face at first view was
like that of an innocent child, but
beneath its youthfulness lay an expression
which bespoke a wealth
of love and strength and patience,
unawakened as yet, but of unusual
force. Skilled to read character
by years of experience in kings’
palaces, madame the countess read
her well&mdash;so far as she could read
at all.</p>

<p>Evidently the maiden saw nothing
that was before her; but madame
held her breath in surprise and
delight, and stood still, waiting her
approach. Not till she came close
to her did the girl look up, then she
too stopped with a startled “Pardon
madame”; and at sight of the timid,
lovely eyes, at the sound of the
voice&mdash;like a flute, like water rippling
softly, like a south wind sighing
in the seaside pines&mdash;madame
opened her arms, and caught the
stranger to her heart. “My child,
my child,” she cried, “how beautiful
you are!”</p>

<p>“Madame, madame,” the girl
panted in amazement, carried away
in her turn at the sudden sight of
this lovely lady, who, she thought,
could be, in her regal beauty and
attire, no less than a princess&mdash;“Madame
sees herself surely!”</p>

<p>The countess laughed outright
at the artless, undesigned compliment.
“And as charming as beautiful,”
she said. “I must see more of
you, my love.”</p>

<p>Then, kissing the cheek, red now
as damask roses, she passed on.
In the hall above her hostess stood
with an arch smile on her lips.
“Ah! Gertrude, we planned it well,”
she said. “Fritz and I have been
watching for that meeting. It was
a brilliant tableau.”</p>

<p>“But who is she, Wilhelmina?
Tell me quickly. She is loveliness
itself.”</p>

<p>“’Tis but a short story, dear. We
found her in Halle. Her name is
Elizabeth Wessenberg. She is well-born,
but her family are strict
Lutherans. She&mdash;timid, precious
little dove!&mdash;became a Catholic by
some good grace of the good God.
But it was a lonely life, and I begged
her off from it for a while.
Oh! but her parents winced to see
her go. They hate the name even
of Catholic. That is all&mdash;only she
sings like a lark, and she hardly
knows what to make of her new life
and faith, it is so strange to her.”</p>

<p>“That is all! Thanks, Wilhelmina.
I will be with you soon.
I long to see her once again.”</p>

<p>All that evening the countess
kept Elizabeth near her, and every
hour her admiration increased.
A maiden so beautiful, yet so ignorant
of her own charms, so unworldly,
so innocent, she had never seen.
Alone in her room that night
she fell trembling upon her knees&mdash;poor,
passionate, self-willed mother!&mdash;before
the statue of the Holy
Mother bearing the divine Son
in her arms, and she held up her
hands and prayed aloud.</p>

<p>“I have found her at last,” she
cried&mdash;“a child who has won her
way into my heart at once with no
effort of her own; a pearl among
all pearls; one whom my boy
<em>must</em> love. Lord Jesus, have I not
given thee two sons? Give me now
one son to keep for my own, and
not for thee. Grant that he may
love this precious creature, fit for
him as though thou thyself hadst
made her for him, even as Eve was
made for Adam.” And then she
covered her face, and sobbed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[640]</a></span>
pleaded with long, wordless prayers.</p>

<p>The next day saw her on her
homeward way, but not alone.
She had coaxed in her irresistible
fashion till she had obtained for
herself from her friend a part of
Elizabeth’s visit; and Elizabeth
felt as if she were living in a
dream, there in the costly coach,
wrapped in furs and watched by
those beautiful eyes. Constantly
the countess talked with her, leading
the conversation delicately in
such a manner that she found out
much in regard to Elizabeth’s home,
and penetrated into her hidden
sorrows in regard to the coldness
and lack of sympathy there. And it
needed no words to tell that this
was a heart which craved sympathy
and love most keenly; which
longed for something higher and
stronger than itself to lean upon.
Every time she looked at the
sensitive face, endowed with such
exquisite refinement of beauty;
every time the childlike yet longing,
unsatisfied eyes met hers;
every time the musical voice fell
upon her ears, fearing ever an
echo of that same craving for something
more and better than the
girl had yet known, madame’s mother-heart
throbbed towards her,
and it seemed to her that she
could hardly wait for the blessing
which, she had persuaded herself,
was surely coming to her at last.</p>

<p>Now and then she spoke of the
country through which they passed:
and to Elizabeth it was almost
incredible that such wealth could
belong to one person only. Now
and then she spoke of “my son”
in a tone of exultant love, and
then Elizabeth trembled a little;
for she dreaded to meet this
stranger. Very grand and proud
she fancied him; one who would
hardly notice at all a person so insignificant
as herself.</p>

<p>“Here is the village chapel,
Elizabeth,” madame said, as the
coach stopped suddenly. “Will
you scold, my little one, if I go
in for a minute to the priest’s
house? Or perhaps you would
like to visit the Blessed Sacrament
while I am gone?”</p>

<p>Yes, that was what Elizabeth
would like indeed; and there she
knelt and prayed, never dreaming
how much was being said about
her only next door.</p>

<p>“Father!” madame exclaimed
impetuously to the gray-haired
priest who rose to greet her, “I
must have Mass said for my intention
every morning for a week.
See, here is a part only of my
offering.” And she laid a heavy
purse upon the table. “If God
grant my prayer, it shall be doubled,
tripled.”</p>

<p>“God’s answers cannot be
bought, madame,” the priest said
sadly, “nor can they be forced.”</p>

<p>“They must be this time, then,
father. You must make my intention
your own. Will you not?
Will you not for this once, father?”</p>

<p>“What is it, then, my daughter?”</p>

<p>“Father, do not be angry. It is
the old hunger wrought up to desperation.
I cannot give my boy
to be a monk!”</p>

<p>The priest’s face darkened.</p>

<p>“No! no!” madame hurried on.
“It is too much to ask of me.
And now I have found a bride for
him at last. She waits for me in
the chapel, fair and pure as the
lilies. I am taking her home in
triumph.”</p>

<p>“Does Heinrich know of this?”</p>

<p>“Not one word. He cannot
fail to love her when he sees her.
It is for this I ask your prayers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[641]</a></span></p>

<p>The priest pushed away the
purse. “I will have none of this,”
he said. “It is far better to see
my poor suffer than that this unrighteous
deed should be done.
You call yourself a Catholic, and
pride yourself because your house
was always Catholic; and yet you
dare say that anything is too much
for God to ask of you! I am an
old man, madame, and have had
many souls to deal with, but I
never yet saw one whose vocation
was more plain than Heinrich’s to
the entire service of God’s church.
Will you dare run counter to God’s
will?”</p>

<p>“Nay, father, it cannot be his
will. Our very name would die
out&mdash;our heritage pass from us!”</p>

<p>“And suppose it does! Who
shall promise you that if Heinrich
marries there shall ever be child
of his to fill his place? And what
<em>are</em> place, and name, and heritage,
madame? That which death,
or war, or a king’s caprice may
snatch away in a moment. But
your spiritual heritage shall never
die. What mother on earth but
might envy you if you give your
three sons&mdash;your all&mdash;to God!
Many are the children of the desolate,
more than of her that hath
an husband, saith the Lord. <em>He</em>
maketh a barren woman to dwell
in a house the joyful mother of
children. There is a place and a
name within his walls better than
sons and daughters. Do you dream
what risk you run, what part you
play, when you would tempt from
his calling one who, if you leave
God to work his own pleasure,
shall hereafter shine as the stars
through all eternity?”</p>

<p>She did not answer back with
pride. Instead, her whole face
grew soft, and the large tears filled
her eyes and ran slowly down her
cheeks. “I want to do right,” she
said humbly; “but I cannot feel
that it is right. Father, see: I will
not ask you to make my intention
yours. But I promise you one
thing: I <em>must</em> ask God to grant
me this blessing, but it shall be the
last time. If I fail now, let his will
be done. And do you, father, ask
him to make it plain to me what
his will is.”</p>

<p>“God bless you, daughter!” the
old priest answered, much moved
by her humility. “I will pray that
indeed. But still I warn you that
I think you are doing wrong in so
much as trying such an experiment
as this which you have undertaken.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” she cried again.
“No, no, father. This once I must
try, or my heart will break.”</p>

<p>Again in the carriage, she pressed
Elizabeth to her closely, and
kissed her, and said words of passionate
love, finding relief thus for
the pent-up feelings of her heart;
but Elizabeth knew not how to
reply. It troubled and perplexed
her&mdash;this lavish affection; for she
could not repay it in kind. It only
served to waken a suffering which
she had known from childhood, a
strange, unsatisfied yearning within
her, which came at the sight of a
lovely landscape, or the sound of
exquisite music, or the caresses of
some friend. She wanted <em>more</em>;
and where and what was that
“more,” which seemed to lie beyond
everything, and which she
could never grasp?</p>

<p>She felt it often during her visit&mdash;that
visit where attention was
constantly bestowed on her, and
she lived in the midst of such luxury
as she had never known before.
Something in Heinrich’s face seemed
to her to promise an answer to
her questionings&mdash;it was so at rest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[642]</a></span>
so settled; and this, more than anything
else about him, interested and
attracted her. Madame saw the interest,
without guessing the cause.
She felt also that Heinrich was not
wholly insensible to Elizabeth’s
presence; and though she asked
him no direct questions, she contrived
to turn conversation into the
channels which could not fail to
engage him, and which the young
convert also cared for most.</p>

<p>Elizabeth decided that Heinrich
knew more than any one else, but
even he tired her sometimes. “He
knows <em>too</em> much,” she thought,
“and he is so cold and indifferent.
Yet he would not be himself
if he were more like madame; and
she is too tender. Oh! what does
it all mean? There is nothing
that makes one content except
church, and one cannot be always
there.”</p>

<p>So passed the time till S. Agnes’
Eve. That night, when the young
people entered the dining-hall,
madame was absent. She sent a
message that they must dine without
her, as she had a severe headache,
and Elizabeth might come
to her an hour after dinner.</p>

<p>The meal was a silent one. When
it was over, and they went into the
library, Heinrich seated himself at
the organ. Grand chorals, funeral
marches full of mourning and
awe and hope, Mass music welcoming
the coming of the Lord of
Sabaoth, filled the lofty room.
When he ceased, Elizabeth was
sobbing irrepressibly.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, forgive me!” she
said. “I cannot help it. O monsieur!
I know not what it means.
Love and hate, beauty and deformity,
joy and suffering&mdash;I cannot understand.
Nothing satisfies, and
to be a Catholic makes the craving
worse. Is it because I am only
just beginning, and that I shall
understand better by and by?”</p>

<p>He stood at a little distance from
her, looking not at her at all, but
upward and far away.</p>

<p>“I will tell mademoiselle a story,
if she will permit it,” he said.
“Many years ago there was a princess,
very beautiful, very wise, and
very wealthy. Her councillors begged
that she would marry, and at
last she told them that she would
do so, if they would find for her
the prince she should describe,
he should be so rich that he should
esteem all the treasures of the Indies
as a little dust; so wise that
no man could ever mention in his
presence aught that he did not already
know; so fair that no child
of man should compare with him
in beauty; so spotless in his soul
that the very heavens should not
be pure in his sight. They knew
not where to find that prince, but
their lady knew.”</p>

<p>He paused, though not as for an
answer. He had guessed well his
mother’s plans and hopes; he fathomed
as truly Elizabeth’s nature;
and when he spoke again, it was as
no one except the priest of God
had ever heard him speak:</p>

<p>“There are some souls whom
no one and nothing on earth can
possibly satisfy. Beauty, and learning,
and friendship, and home, and
love, each alike wearies them. God
only can content them, and he is
enough&mdash;<em>God alone</em>. To such souls
he gives himself, if they sincerely
desire it. It is a love beyond all
imaginable earthly love. It satisfies,
yet leaves a constant craving
which we have no wish should
cease. He understands everything:
even those things which we cannot
explain to ourselves. It is he finding
whom the soul loveth him, and
will not let him go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[643]</a></span></p>

<p>After saying this, he sat down
once more at the organ, and played
again till the hour named by
madame arrived. Elizabeth found
her pale and suffering, but with a
glad look in her eyes.</p>

<p>“You have had talk together,
then,” she cried. “I heard the
music cease for a while. And is
he not charming and good, my
Heinrich?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Elizabeth said dreamily.
“He made me understand a little
to-night&mdash;better than any one has
ever done before.”</p>

<p>“Is that so, my little one? And
how then?”</p>

<p>“Here,” Elizabeth said innocently,
laying her hand on her heart,
and with no suspicion of the meaning
which the countess attached to
the act. “If I could only understand
more&mdash;more.”</p>

<p>“You will in time, most dear one&mdash;in
time, in time.” And oh! the
exulting ring in madame’s voice.
“But see, my precious, what I have
to show you.”</p>

<p>A chest was drawn up beside
madame’s easy-chair. She opened
it, and before Elizabeth’s dazzled
eyes lay jewels of wondrous lustre
and value&mdash;long strings of pearls,
changing opals with the fire-spark
trembling in them, sapphires blue
as the sky, emeralds green as the
sea, and glittering diamonds. Madame
drew out the costly things,
and adorned Elizabeth with one set
after another by turn, watching the
effect. Last of all, she touched a
spring, and took from a secret
drawer a set of pearls, large and
round, with a soft amber tint in
them. These she held caressingly
and sighed.</p>

<p>“Look, Elizabeth,” she said.
“Forty years ago this very night I
wore them, when I was a girl like
you. There was a great ball here.
Some one&mdash;ah! but how grand and
beautiful he looked; my poor
heart remembers well, and is sore
with the memory now&mdash;some one
begged me to try the charm of S.
Agnes’ Eve. Dost know it, dear?
Nay? Then you shall try it too.
Go supperless to rest; look not to
left or right, nor yet behind you,
but pray God to show you that
which shall satisfy your heart of
hearts.”</p>

<p>“Did he show you, madame?”</p>

<p>Madame sighed heavily. “Alas!
love, alas! What contents us here?
I had it for a time, and then God
took it from me. No prouder wife
than I, no prouder mother; but
husband and sons are gone, all except
my Heinrich. Pray God to
keep him for me, Elizabeth, Elizabeth.”</p>

<p>“And who, then, was S. Agnes,
madame? And shall I pray to her
that prayer?”</p>

<p>Madame looked aghast, then
smiled an amused yet troubled
smile. “Nay, child, I thought not
of that. S. Agnes was one who
loved our blessed Lord alone,
not man. She died rather than
yield to earthly love and joy.”</p>

<p>“But why, madame?”</p>

<p>“O child, child! But I forget,
You have only just begun the Catholic
life, my sweet. God’s love,
then, is enough for some people;
but they are monks and nuns, not
common Christians like you and
me and Heinrich. We could not
live in that way, could we, Elizabeth&mdash;you
and Heinrich and I?”</p>

<p>“And God would never grow tired
of us, madame! Nor ever die!
Nor ever misunderstand! O madame!
I think we could not live
with less.” And Elizabeth stood up
suddenly, as if too agitated to remain
quiet.</p>

<p>“Ah! love, you are only just a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[644]</a></span>
convert. In one’s first excitement
one fancies many things. You are
meant to serve God in the world,
my dear, for many years to come&mdash;you
and my Heinrich. Pray for
him to-night.”</p>

<p>But hurrying along the hall to
her own room, Elizabeth whispered
passionately in her heart: “I do
not want to pray for him. Let him
pray for himself. His saints pray
for him too, and God loves him,
and he does not need me. Does
madame, then, suppose that he
could ever care for me, or I for
him? I want more than he can
give&mdash;more&mdash;more! <em>Show</em> me my
heart’s desire, O God, my God!”</p>

<p>In her excitement and in the
darkness she laid her hand on the
wrong door, and, opening it, found
herself in an old gallery, at the end
of which a light was glimmering.
Scarcely heeding what she did, she
moved toward it, and found that
she was in the choir of the castle
chapel. The door fell gently to behind
her, but did not close, and
Elizabeth was alone. Alone? The
aisles were empty, the organ was
still, the priest was gone; but before
the sacred shrine the steady ray of
the lamp told that He who filleth
the heaven of heavens was dwelling
in his earthly temple, and that unseen
angels guarded all the place.</p>

<p>But of angels or men Elizabeth
thought not. Silently, slowly she
moved onward, her hands pressed
upon her heart, whose passionate
beating grew still as she came nearer
to the Sacred Heart which alone
could fully comfort, fully strengthen,
fully understand. Slowly she
moved, as one who knows that
some great joy is coming surely,
and who lengthens willingly the
bliss of expectation.</p>

<p>And so she reached a narrow
flight of steps, and made her way
gently down, and knelt. Outside,
in the clear night, a great wind rose,
and rocked the castle-tower, but
Elizabeth knew it not. She was
conscious only of the intense stillness
of that unseen Presence; of
peace flooding her whole soul like
a river; of the nearness of One who
is strength and love and truth, infinite
and eternal.</p>

<p>“Show me my heart’s desire, O
God, my God!” she sighed.</p>

<p>God, <em>my</em> God! She lifted up her
eyes, and there, above the shrine,
beheld the great crucifix of Hohenstein,
brought from the far-off East
by a Crusader knight. She lifted
up her eyes, and saw the haggard
face full of unceasing prayer, the
sunken cheeks, the pierced hands
and feet, the bones, easy to number,
in the worn and tortured body, the
side with its deep wound where a
spear had passed.</p>

<p>Yet, looking upward steadily, all
her excitement gone, a sacred calm
upon her inmost soul, Elizabeth
knew that her prayer was answered,
her lifelong hunger satisfied. God
had given her her heart’s desire.</p>

<p>God, <em>my</em> God! No love but his
could satisfy; and his could with
an eternal content. To that Heart,
pierced for her, broken for her, she
could offer no less than her whole
heart; and that she <em>must</em> offer, not
by constraint, but simply because
she loved him beyond all, above
all, and knew that in him, and in
him only, she was sure of an unfailing,
an everlasting love.</p>

<p>Madame, seeking her in the early
morning, found her room unoccupied,
then noticed the gallery-door
ajar, and, trembling, sought her
there. Elizabeth had kept S. Agnes’
Eve indeed, but it was before the
shrine of S. Agnes’ Spouse and
Lord.</p>

<p>“My daughter,” the countess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[645]</a></span>
said, using the word for the first
time, and with oh! how sad a tone&mdash;“what
have you done this night,
my daughter?”</p>

<p>Elizabeth lifted hand and face
toward the shrine. “Madame,”
she answered slowly, as one who
speaks unconsciously in sleep, “I
have found Him whom my soul
loveth. I hold him, and I will not
let him go.”</p>

<p>God himself had made his way
plain indeed before Madame the
Countess of Hohenstein in this her
last struggle with his will. The
very plan which she had chosen to
gain her cherished hopes had crushed
them. Not priest or son, but
the girl whom she herself had named
for her final trial, had shown her
that God’s purposes were far aside
from hers.</p>

<p>“Take all, O Lord!” she cried,
while her tears fell like rain. “Take
all I have. I dare not struggle
longer.”</p>

<p>One son gave up his life a martyr
in the blood-stained church in
Japan. Another endured a lifelong
martyrdom among the lepers
of the Levant, winning souls yet
more tainted than the bodies home
again to God. And one, the youngest,
and the fairest, and the dearest,
was seen in China and in India, in
Peru and in Mexico, going without
question wherever he was sent, for
the greater glory of God; but he
was never seen in his German
home again. After they once left
her, their mother never beheld their
faces. And she who had been
taken to her heart as a daughter
entered an order in a distant land.</p>

<p>Yet none ever heard madame
the last Countess of Hohenstein
murmur against her lot. Clearly,
tenderly, patiently, more and more
did God vouchsafe to make his way
plain to her. In chapel, day by
day, she watched the decaying banners
which told of the fields her fathers
won; saw the monuments to
men of her race who had fought
and died for their king and their
land; read the names once proudly
vaunted, now almost forgotten.
What was fame like this to the
honor God had showered on her?
Souls east and west brought safe
to him; life laid down for the Lord
of lords; a seed not to be reckoned;
a lineage which could never fail;
sons and daughters to stand at last
in that multitude which no one
can number, who have come out
of great tribulation, with fadeless
palms of victory in their hands&mdash;such
was her place and name in the
house of God.</p>

<p>The quaint German text upon
her tombstone puzzled travellers
greatly, and those who could decipher
it wondered but the more. It
ran thus:</p>

<p class="center"><i lang="la">Requiescat in Pace.</i><br />
GERTRUDE,<br />
<i>Twenty-ninth and Last Countess of Hohenstein</i>.</p>

<p>The children of thy barrenness shall
still say in thy ears: The place is too
strait for me; make me room to dwell
in. And thou shalt say in thy heart:
Who hath begotten me these? I was
barren, and brought not forth, led away,
and captive; and who hath brought up
these? I was destitute and alone; and
these, where were they?</p>

<p>Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I
will lift up my hand to the Gentiles, and
will set up my standard to the people.
And they shall bring thy sons in their
arms, and carry thy daughters upon their
shoulders. And thou shalt know that I
am the Lord; for they shall not be confounded
that wait for him.</p>

<h3>THE BASQUES.</h3>

<p>We are all Basques. Nay, reader,
be not startled at having your supposed
nationality thus suddenly set
aside. An author of far more learning
than we can lay claim to&mdash;Señor
Erro, a Spanish Basque&mdash;gravely
asserts that all the inhabitants of
Europe and Asia, if not of America
also, sprang from the Basques.
In short, they&mdash;that is, <em>we</em>&mdash;are the
primitive race. And this fearless
writer, with a due sense of national
superiority, goes boldly on to prove
that Adam and Eve spoke the
Basque language in the terrestrial
Paradise, of which he gives a detailed
description according to the
Biscayan interpretation of the Biblical
account.</p>

<p>We remember how, in search of
Adam&mdash;great progenitor!&mdash;whose
said-to-be-fine statue is among the
army of saints on the glorious roof
of Milan cathedral, we got bewildered
on that celestial height, so
that we do not to this day feel
sure of having discovered the true
Adam, and might never have found
our way down to earth again had it
not been for the kind offices of one
of Victor Emanuel’s soldiers. So
it is with many a <i lang="fr">savant</i> in tracing
the origin of the human species.
Lost in threading the way back to
our first parents, they need some
rough, uncultured soul to lead them
out of the bewildering maze&mdash;back
to the point whence they started.</p>

<p>But let us hope in this instance
filial instinct has not mistaken the
genuine Adam&mdash;the first speaker, it
is possible, of Basque. Señor Erro
finds in this language the origin of
all civilization and science. It
must be confessed we have wofully
forgotten our mother-tongue; for it
is said to be impossible to learn to
speak it unless one goes very young
among the Basques. It is a common
saying of theirs that the devil
once came into their country to
learn the language, but gave it up
in despair after three hundred
years’ application! It may be inferred
he had lost the knowledge
he had made such successful use
of a few thousand years before in
the Garden of Eden.</p>

<p>M. Astarloa, likewise a Biscayan,
maintains that the extraordinary
perfection of this language is a
proof it is the only one that could
have been conferred on the first
man by his Creator, but in another
place says it was formed by God
himself at the confusion of tongues
in the tower of Babel&mdash;which assertions
rather lack harmony.</p>

<p>Max Müller, the eminent philologist,
pretends a serious discussion
took place about two hundred
years ago in the metropolitan chapter
of Pampeluna as to the following
knotty points:</p>

<p><i>First.</i> Was Basque the primitive
language of mankind? The learned
members confessed that, however
strong might be their private
convictions, they did not dare give
an affirmative reply.</p>

<p><i>Secondly.</i> Was Basque the only
language spoken by Adam and Eve
in the garden of Eden?</p>

<p>As to this, the whole chapter declared
there could be no doubt
whatever that it was “impossible to
bring a reasonable objection against
such an opinion.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[647]</a></span></p>

<p>This is extremely amusing; but,
of course, too absurd to be true.
Besides, the archives of Pampeluna
do not afford the slightest hint of
so singular a record.</p>

<p>Southwestern France, however,
has many traditions of the Oriental
origin of its inhabitants. Tarbes
and Lourdes are said to have been
founded by Abyssinian princesses.
Belleforest, in his <cite>Cosmography</cite>,
says Japhet himself came into
Gaul and built the city of Périgueux,
which for several ages bore
his name. Père Bajole, of Condom,
a Jesuit of the XVIIth century,
is less precise in his suppositions,
but thinks the country was peopled
soon after the Deluge, and therefore
by those who had correct notions
of the true God. Moreover
as Noah, of course, would not have
allowed his descendants to depart
without suitable advice as to the
way of salvation, especially to the
head of the colony, he concludes
that many of the ancient Aquitanians
were saved. The Sire Dupleix
cites the epistle of S. Martial
to show they had retained some
proper notions of theology, which
accounts for the rapid success of
the first Christian apostles of the
country.</p>

<p>But to return to the Basques in
particular: In the <cite>Leyenda Pendadola</cite>&mdash;an
old book of the XIth
century&mdash;we read that “the first
settlement in Spain was made by
the patriarch Tubal, whose people
spoke the language still used in
the provinces of Biscay”&mdash;that is,
the Basque. William von Humboldt
likewise attributed to the
Basques an Asiatic origin, and was
decidedly of the school of MM.
Erro and Astarloa, though he rejected
their exaggerations. The
Basque language, so rich, harmonious,
and expressive, is now generally
believed to be one of the Turanian
tongues. Prince Lucian Bonaparte
shows the analogy between it and
the Hungarian, Georgian, etc.</p>

<p>The word Basque is derived
from the Latin <i lang="la">Vasco</i>; for in Southwestern
France it is quite common
to pronounce the letter <em>v</em> like <em>b</em>&mdash;a
habit which made Scaliger wittily
say: <i lang="la">Felices populi, quibus Vivere
est Bibere</i>.</p>

<p>The Basque country consists of
several provinces on both sides of the
Pyrenees bordering on the Bay of
Biscay. Labourd, Soule, and Lower
Navarre are now in the department
of the Basses-Pyrenees, on the
French side. The two provinces of
Biscay and Guipuzcoa&mdash;a part of
Alava and of Upper Navarre&mdash;belong
to Spain. The whole Basque
population cannot be more than
500,000. The people, as we have
had a proof of, are proud of their
ancient nationality; and though
there is a difference of manners,
physiognomy, and even of idiom in
these sections, they all recognize
each other as brethren. They are
a noble race, and have accomplished
great deeds in their day.
Entrenched behind their mountains,
they long kept the Romans at
bay, drove back the Moors, and
crushed the rear-guard of Charlemagne.</p>

<p>The Basques have always been
famous navigators. The first suggestion
that led to the discovery
of America is said to have been
given Christopher Columbus by
Sanchez de Huelva, a Basque pilot.
The Basques of Labourd certainly
discovered Cape Breton. They
were the first to go on whale-fisheries,
which, in 1412, extended as
far as Iceland. And Newfoundland
seems to have been known to them
in the middle of the XVth century.
The first name of Cape Breton&mdash;isle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[648]</a></span>
des Bacaloas or Bacaloac&mdash;is a
Basque name.</p>

<p>In the middle ages the Basques
maintained a certain independence
by means of their <i lang="es">fueros</i>, or special
privileges, which had been handed
down from time immemorial and
confirmed by several of the kings
of France. The wood of Haïtze is
still pointed out as the place where
the assemblies of the elders, or <i lang="es">bilçars</i>,
were formerly held in the district
of Labourd. Here came together
the proprietors of the different
communes to regulate their
administrative affairs. The most
of the assembly leaned on their
staves or against the venerable oaks
of the forest. But the presiding
member sat on a huge stone, the
secretary on another, while a third
was used for recording the decrees
of the assembly, to which the kings
of France and Navarre were often
forced to yield by virtue of their
<i lang="es">fueros</i>.</p>

<p>And this country was never over-ruled
by oppressive lords who held
it in subjection by means of their
fortified castles. The device of Bayonne&mdash;<i lang="la">Nunquam
polluta</i>&mdash;seems
to express the unstained independence
that had never been subjected
to feudal dominion. It doubtless
had great families who distinguished
themselves by their bravery
and military services, and were
noted for their wealth, like the
<i lang="es">casas de parientes majores</i>&mdash;the twenty-four
families of great antiquity&mdash;in
Guypuzcoa, among which was
the family of Loyola of Aspeïtia, to
which the immortal founder of the
Jesuits belonged, as well as that of
Balda, his mother’s family; but they
never pretended to the feudal authority
of the great nobles of France
and Spain. It was only in the
XVth century that several Basque
families, who had become wealthy,
ventured to erect some inoffensive
towers like those of Uturbi near St.
Jean de Luz, occupied by Louis
XI. while on the frontier arranging
the treaty between the kings of Castile
and Arragon.</p>

<p>It is said of the Basques of Spain:
As many Basques, as many nobles.
Many of their villages have coats
of arms on all the houses, which
contrast with the decayed lattices
and crumbling roofs. The owners
point to their emblazonry with the
air of a Montmorency. When the
Moors invaded the North of Spain,
thousands of mountaineers rose to
drive them out. As they made
war at their own expense, those
who returned alive to their cottages
received the reward of gentlemen&mdash;the
right of assuming some heraldic
sign and graving it on their walls
as a perpetual memorial of their
deeds. In the valley of Roncal
the inhabitants were all ennobled
for having distinguished themselves
at the battle of Olaso, in the reign
of Fortunio Garcia. In the village
of Santa Lucia, not far from Toledo,
an old house of the XIIIth century
is still to be seen with double lancet
windows, which has its record
over the door proving the part a
former owner had taken at the
bridge of Olaso&mdash;an azure field
traversed by a river, which is spanned
by a bridge with three golden
arches surmounted by the bleeding
head of a Moor.</p>

<p>In a faubourg of Tolosa is a
modest house stating that Juan
Perez having borne arms for more
than fifty years in Italy, Spain,
Portugal, Flanders, etc., and taken
part in the great naval victory over
the Turks at Lepanto under Don
Juan of Austria, the emperor created
him knight and gave him for
his arms the imperial eagle.</p>

<p>But most of these armorial bearings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">[649]</a></span>
have reference to the chase, to
which the people were so addicted.
The trophies they brought home,
instead of being nailed up over the
door, were now graven there in
stone&mdash;sometimes a wolf, or a hare,
or even a favorite hound. Two
dogs are on the arms inherited by
the Prince of Viana, the donor of
the fine bells to the basilica of
Notre Dame de Lourdes.</p>

<p>In the commune of Bardos is a
château which bears the name of
Salla from the founder of the family.
It was he who, fighting under
Alphonse the Chaste, King of Navarre,
had his legs broken by the
explosion of a rock, from which
time the house of Salla has had for
its arms three <i lang="fr">chevrons brisés, d’or,
sur un champ d’azur</i>. The most illustrious
member of this family is
Jean Baptiste de la Salle, who
founded the admirable order of the
Brothers of the Christian Schools,
with a special mission for instructing
the poor.</p>

<p>Mgr. de Belsunce, the celebrated
bishop of Marseilles, was also of
Basque origin. The Château de
Belsunce is still to be seen&mdash;an
old manor-house with Gothic turrets
bespeaking the antiquity of
the family. The name is associated
with the legends of the country.
Tradition relates that a winged
monster having terrified the
whole region, a knight of this
house armed himself with a lance
and went forth to attack the
monster in his den. The dragon,
having received a mortal wound,
sprang with a dying effort upon his
enemy, seized him, and rolled with
him into the Nive. From that
time the family of Belsunce bore
on its shield a dragon sable on a
field gules.</p>

<p>The arms of Fontarabia is a
siren on the waves bearing a mirror
and a comb&mdash;symbol of this
enchanting region. This historic
place, once the rival of St. Jean de
Luz, now wears a touching aspect
of desolation and mourning which
only adds to its attractions. Its
ruins have a hue of antiquity that
must delight a painter’s eye. The
long street that leads to the principal
square carries one back three
hundred years, most of the houses
being in the Spanish style of the
XVIth century. There are coats
of arms over every door, and balconies
projecting from every story,
with complicated trellises or lattices
that must almost madden the
moon-struck serenader. Nothing
could be more picturesque than
this truly Spanish place. Many of
the houses bear the imposing name
of <i lang="es">palacios</i>, which testify to the ancient
splendor of this <i lang="es">ciudad muy
noble, muy leal, y muy valerosa</i>.
Overlooking the whole place is the
château of Jeanne la Folle, massive,
heavy, its walls three yards
thick, its towers round&mdash;a genuine
fortress founded in the Xth century,
but mostly rebuilt by Charles
V. Its chronicles are full of historic
interest. Here took place
the interview between Louis XI.
and Henri IV. of Castille, whose
arrogant favorite, Beltram de la
Cueva, in his mantle broidered
with gold and pearls and diamonds,
and his boat with its awning
of cloth of gold, must have offered
a striking contrast to the extreme
simplicity of the King of
France.</p>

<p>The fine, imposing church of
Fontarabia, in the transition style,
is a marked exception to the Basque
churches generally, which are of
simple primitive architecture, with
but few ornaments; and these, at
least on the French side of the frontier,
mostly confined to the sanctuary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[650]</a></span>
which is rich in color and gilding.
Perhaps over the main altar
is a painting, but by no means by
Murillo or Velasquez. If on the
Spanish side, it may be a S. Iago
on a white steed, sword in hand,
with a red mantle over his pilgrim’s
dress, looking like a genuine <i lang="es">matamore</i>,
breathing destruction against
the Moors. The Madonna, too, is
always there, perhaps with a wheel
of silver swords, as if in her bosom
were centred all the sorrows of the
human race.</p>

<p>The galleries around the nave in
the Basque churches gives them the
appearance of a <i lang="fr">salle de spectacle</i>;
but the clergy think the separation
of the sexes promotes the respect
due in the sanctuary, and the people
themselves cling to the practice.
The men occupy the galleries.
They all have rosaries in their
hands. From time to time you
can see them kiss their thumbs,
placed in the form of a cross, perhaps
to set a seal on their vows to
God, as people in the middle ages
used to seal their letters with their
thumbs to give them a sacred inviolability.
Licking the thumb
was, we know, an ancient form of
giving a solemn pledge; and, till a
recent period, the legal form of
completing a bargain in Scotland
was to join the thumbs and lick
them. “What say ye, man? There’s
my thumb; I’ll ne’er beguile ye,”
said Rob Roy to Bailie Nicol
Jarvie.</p>

<p>When Mass is over, every man in
the galleries respectfully salutes his
next neighbor. This is considered
obligatory. Were it even his deadliest
enemy, he must bow his head
before him. Mass heard with devotion
brings the Truce of God to
the heart.</p>

<p>The women occupy the nave, sitting
or kneeling on the black,
funereal-looking carpet that covers
the stone above the tomb of their
beloved dead. For every family
has a slab of wood or marble with
an inscription in large characters,
which covers the family vault below,
and their notions of pious respect
oblige the living to kneel on the
stone that covers the bones of their
forefathers. Or this <em>was</em> the case;
for of late years burial in churches
has been forbidden, and these slabs
now only serve to designate the inalienable
right of the families to occupy
them during the divine service.
It is curious and interesting to examine
these sepulchral slabs; for
they are like the archives of a town
inscribed with the names of the
principal inhabitants, with their
rank and occupation. In some
places the women, by turns, bring
every morning an offering for their
pastor, which they deposit on these
stones like an expiatory libation.
Several of them are daily garnished
with fruit, wine, eggs, beeswax,
yarn, and linen thread, and the
<i lang="fr">curé</i>, accompanied by his servant
or the sacristan, goes around after
Mass to collect this tribute of rural
piety in a basket, and give his blessing
to the families. These offerings
of the first-fruits of the earth are
still continued, though the dead are
buried elsewhere.</p>

<p>The seat of that mighty potentate,
the village mayor, is in the
choir, as befits his dignity, which
he fully sustains by his majestic deportment
in sight of the whole congregation.
Sometimes he chants
at the lectern, like Charlemagne.
The square peristyle of the church
is often divided between him and
the village school-master for their
respective functions, as if to invest
them with a kind of sanctity.</p>

<p>In Soule the belfry is formed by
extending upwards the western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[651]</a></span>
wall of the church in the form of
three gables, looking like three
obelisks. The bell is hung in the
central one. The origin of this
custom is thus explained by M.
Cénac Montaut:</p>

<p>“In former times, when the
Basques had some difficulty about
accepting all the truths of the Gospel,
the clergy were unable to make
them comprehend the doctrine of
the Holy Trinity. One of the
priests, like S. Patrick with the
shamrock, saw he must appeal to
the senses in order to reach the
mind and heart. Entering his
rude pulpit one day, he addressed
his flock something after the following
manner: ‘Some of you,
my dear brethren, recently objected
that the God of the Old Testament,
in the tables of the law,
wished to be worshipped as one
God, and that to add now the
Son and Holy Spirit to the Deity
is to overthrow the law of Sinai
and affect the divine Essence itself.…
My dear brethren, hitherto
we have had but one gable on our
belfry, directing towards heaven the
innermost prayer of the heart, and
bearing the bell by which God
seems to speak to us in return. If,
now, two other gables were added
to this, would not this triple tower,
standing on one base, and pointing
to the same heaven, still constitute
one belfry?’”</p>

<p>This appeal was effective. Those
who had been unable to accept the
abstract doctrine of the Trinity
perfectly comprehended this material
unity. The other priests of
Soule hastened to make use of so
happy an oratorical figure, and all
through the valley of the Gave
rose the three-gabled, dogmatic
belfries, such as we see at the present
day.</p>

<p>Near the church is often a modest
white house with a small garden
containing a few trees and flowers,
where the Daughters of the Cross
devote themselves to the instruction
of children, planting the seeds of
piety in their youthful hearts.</p>

<p>The Basque houses, with their
triangular, tile-covered roofs, often
project like a <i lang="fr">châlet</i>, and are painted
white, green, and even pink.
The casements are made in the
form of a cross, and stained red.
The doorway is arched like a
church-portal, and has over it a
Virgin, or crucifix, or some pious
inscription. There is no bolt on
the door; for a Basque roof is too
inviolable to need a fastening. At
the entrance is a <i lang="fr">bénitier</i> (for holy
water), as if the house were to the
owner a kind of sanctuary to be
entered with purification and a
holy thought. You enter a large
hall that divides the house into two
parts, and contains all the farming
utensils. It is here the husbandman
husks his corn and thrashes
his wheat. The uncolored walls
of the rooms are hung with a few
rude pictures, as of the Last Judgment,
the Wandering Jew, or Napoleon.
There are some large
presses, a few wooden chairs, a
shelf in the corner with a lace-edged
covering for the statue of
the Virgin, who wears a crown
of <i lang="fr">immortelles</i> on her head and a
rosary around her neck. At one
end of the room is a bed large
enough for a whole family, and so
high as almost to need a ladder to
ascend it. The open pink curtains
show the holy-water font, the
crucifix, and faded palm branch annually
renewed. There is no house
without some religious symbol.
The Basque has great faith in prayer.
He stops his plough or wild
native dance to say the Angelus.
He never forgets to arm himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">[652]</a></span>
with the sign of the cross in a
moment of danger. He makes it
over the loaf of bread before he
divides it among the family. The
mother makes it on the foreheads of
her children at night. At Candlemas
a blessed candle burns under
every roof in honor of the true
Light which lighteth every man
that cometh into the world. It is
the boast of the country that
Protestantism never found entrance
therein, even during its prevalence
in Béarn at the time of Joan of
Navarre, though that princess took
pains to have the Huguenot version
of the New Testament translated
into Basque and published at La
Rochelle in 1591 for their benefit.
The whole Bible is now translated,
M. Duvoisin having devoted six
years to the work, and Prince Lucian
Bonaparte a still longer time
in settling the orthography and
superintending the edition.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed, however,
that the Basques are an austere
race. They are very fond of
their national dances, and excel in
the <i lang="fr">jeu de paume</i>. Among their
other amusements is the <i lang="fr">pastorale</i>,
acted in the open air with a <i lang="fr">chirula</i>
(a kind of flute) and a tambourine
for the orchestra. The subject is
borrowed from the Bible, the legend
of Roland, the wars with the
Moors, etc. They are composed
by native poets, and have a certain
antique simplicity not without its
charm. The people flock to these
representations, as to their Cantabrian
dances, in their gayest attire.
The old man wears a <i lang="fr">béret</i> drawn
over his forehead, while his long
hair floats behind in token of the
nobility of his ancient race. He
wears short breeches, long woollen
stockings, and leather shoes with
handsome silver buckles.</p>

<p>The young Basque, straight, well
formed, and proud in his bearing,
wears his blue <i lang="fr">béret</i> jauntily perched
on one side of his head. His
jacket is short. Silver clasps fasten
his collar and wristbands. He
wears sandals on his feet, with red
bars across the instep. A bright
red sash girdles his waist&mdash;as of all
mountaineers, enabling them to endure
fatigue the better, like the
surcingle of a horse. “Beware of
that young man with the loose
girdle,” said Sulla, speaking of
Cæsar. For among the Romans
the word <i lang="la">discinctus</i> was applied to
the indolent, cowardly soldier, as
<i lang="la">alte cinctus</i> (high-girdled) meant a
prompt, courageous man.</p>

<p>The girls, slender in form, with
regular, expressive features, are veiled
in a black mantilla, or else carry
it on their arms. A gay kerchief
is wound around the back of their
heads like a turban, leaving visible
the shining bands of their beautiful
black hair.</p>

<p>The old women wear white muslin
kerchiefs on their heads, with
one corner falling on the shoulder.
On the breast is suspended a golden
heart or <i lang="fr">Saint-Esprit</i>. Sometimes
they are enveloped from head
to foot in a great black cloak,
which is absolutely requisite when
they attend a funeral. This mantle
forms part of the <i lang="fr">trousseau</i> of
every bride of any substance, and
she wears it on her wedding-day,
as if to show herself prepared to
pay due honor to all the friends
who should depart this life before
her. It must be a great comfort
for them to see this mourning garment
prepared in advance, and the
sight of the bride veiled in her
long black capuchin must diffuse a
rather subdued gayety over the wedding
party.</p>

<p>The Basques pay great respect
to the dead. When a man dies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">[653]</a></span>
his next neighbor on the right carries
the crucifix before his bier in the
funeral procession, and his nearest
neighbor on the left walks at its
side. And the whole neighborhood
assembles around it in church, with
lighted candles in their hands, to
hear the Mass for the Dead. They
adorn their graveyards with shrubs
and flowers. And they never omit
the month’s-mind, or anniversary
service.</p>

<p>Of course no one goes to the
Basque country without visiting the
famous Pas de Roland. The whole
region is singularly wild and
picturesque. We pass through a
deep gorge encumbered with rocks,
over which the Nive plunges and
foams in the maddest possible
way. Twin mountains of granite
rise to the very heavens, their sides
covered with the golden broom, or
furrowed with deep gullies that tell
of mountain torrents. The overhanging
cliffs, and the dizzy, winding
road along the edge of the abyss,
create a feeling of awe; and by the
time we arrive, breathless and fatigued,
at the Pas de Roland, we
are quite prepared to believe anything
marvellous.</p>

</div>

<p>This archway was produced by a
mere blow from the heel of the
great Paladin, who did not consider
the mountain worthy the use of
his mighty sword. Everything is
bathed in the golden light of the
wondrous legend, which harmonizes
with the spot. We even
fancy we can hear the powerful
horn of Orlando&mdash;the greatest
trumpeter on record. We can see
Carloman, with his black plumes
and red mantle&mdash;opera-like&mdash;as he
is described in the <i lang="fr">Chant d’Altabisçar</i>!
The natives, <i lang="fr">pur sang</i>,
do not call this pass by the name
of Roland, but <i lang="es">Utheca gaiz</i>&mdash;a bad,
dangerous passage, as in truth it
is. It is the only means of communication
with the opposite side
of the mountain. After going
through it, the mountains recede,
the horizon expands, a country full
of bucolic delights is revealed to
the eye, the exaltation of the soul
subsides, and the mind settles down
to its normal state of incredulity.</p>

<p>Just below the Pas de Roland,
on the French side, are the thermal
springs of Cambo, in a lovely little
valley watered by the Nive. The
air here is pure, the climate mild,
the meadows fresh and sprinkled
with flowers, the encircling hills
are crowned with verdure. Never
did Nature put on an aspect of
more grace and beauty than in
this delicious spot. One of the
springs is sulphurous, the other
ferruginous. They became popular
among the Spanish and Basques during
the last century when patronized
by Queen Marie Anne de Neuberg,
the second wife of Don Carlos
II. of Spain. Some of her royal
gifts to the church of Cambo are
still shown with pride. These
springs were visited as early as
1585, among others, by François de
Nouailles, Bishop of Dax, who is
often referred to in proof of their
efficacy; but as that eminent diplomatist
died a few weeks after he
tried the waters, the less said of his
cure the better for their reputation.
Napoleon I., however, had faith in
their virtues. He visited Cambo,
and was only prevented by his
downfall from building a military
hospital here.</p>

<p>Not two miles from Cambo is the
busy town of Hasparren. The way
thither is through a delightful country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[654]</a></span>
with some fresh beauty bursting
on the eye at every step. On all
sides are to be seen the neat white
cottages of the laborers in the midst
of orchards, meadows, and vineyards;
sometimes in the hollows of
a valley like a nest among the green
leaves; sometimes on the hills commanding
the most delicious of landscapes.
Hasparren has about six
thousand inhabitants, mostly farmers,
but who try to increase their
income by some trade. Twelve
hundred of them are shoemakers;
seven or eight hundred are weavers,
curriers, or chocolate-makers. The
spacious church is hardly able to
contain the crowd of worshippers
on festivals. A curious history is
connected with the belfry.</p>

<p>The government having imposed
a tax on salt in 1784, the people
around Hasparren, who had hitherto
been exempted, resolved to resist
so heavy an impost. They rang the
bell with violence to call together
the inhabitants. Even the women
assembled in bands with spits,
pitchforks, and sickles, to the sound
of a drum, which one of their number
beat before them. The mob,
amounting to two thousand, entrenched
themselves in the public
cemetery, where they received with
howls of rage the five brigades the
governor of Bayonne was obliged to
send for the enforcement of the
law. Bloodshed was prevented by
the venerable <i lang="fr">curé</i>, who rose from
his sick-bed and appeared in their
midst. By his mild, persuasive
words he calmed the excited crowd,
induced the troops to retire and the
mob to disperse. The leaders being
afterwards arrested, he also effected
their pardon&mdash;on humiliating
conditions, however, to the town.
The hardest was, perhaps, the destruction
of the belfry, from which
they had rung the alarm; and it was
not till some time in the present
century they were allowed to rebuild
it.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that the ancient
Basques left no poems, no war-songs
to celebrate their valorous
deeds, no epic in which some adventurous
mariner recites his wanderings;
for the language is flexible
and easily bends to rhythm. But
the people seem better musicians
than poets. There are, to be sure,
some rude plaints of love, a few
smugglers’ or fishermen’s songs, sung
to bold airs full of wild harmony
that perhaps used to animate their
forefathers to fight against the
Moors; but these songs have no literary
merit. Only two poems in
the language have acquired a certain
celebrity, because published by
prominent men who ascribed to
them a great antiquity. One of
these is the <i lang="fr">Chant des Cantabres</i>,
published by Wilhelm von Humboldt
in 1817 in connection with
an essay on the Basque language.
Ushered into the world by so distinguished
a linguist, it was eagerly
welcomed by German <i lang="fr">savants</i>, and
regarded as a precious memorial
of past ages. M. von Humboldt
took it from the MSS. of a Spaniard
employed in 1590 to explore
the archives of Simancas and Biscay.
He pretended to have found
it written on an old, worm-eaten
parchment, as well it might be if
done soon after the invasion of the
country by the Romans. We wonder
he did not also find the history
of the conquest of Cantabria in five
books composed by the Emperor
Augustus himself, said to have
been in existence in the XVIIth
century!</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr">Chant d’Altabisçar</i> is said to
have been discovered by M. La
Tour d’Auvergne in an old convent
at St. Sebastian, in 1821, written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[655]</a></span>
on parchment in characters
of the XIIIth or XIVth century.
It is unfortunate so valuable a MS.,
like the original poems of Ossian,
should have been lost! The contents,
however, were preserved and
published in 1835, and, though now
considered spurious, merit a certain
attention because formerly regarded
as genuine by such men as
Victor Hugo, who, in his <cite>Légende
des Siècles</cite>, speaks of Charlemagne
as “plein de douleur” to think</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>M. Olivier, in his <cite>Dictionnaire de
la Conversation</cite>, enthusiastically exclaims:
“What shall I say of the
Basque chants, and where did this
people, on their inaccessible heights,
obtain such boldness of rhythm and
intonation? Every Basque air I
know is grand and decided in tone,
but none more strikingly so than
the national chant of the Escualdunacs,
as they call themselves in
their language. And yet this fine
poem has for some of its lines only
the cardinal numbers up to twenty,
and then repeated in reverse order.
Often, while listening to the pure,
fresh melody of this air, I have
wondered what meaning was concealed
beneath these singular lines.
From one hypothesis to another I
have gone back to the time when
the Vascon race, hedged in at the
foot of the Pyrenees by the Celtic
invaders, sought refuge among the
inaccessible mountains. Then, it
seemed to me, this <cite>Chant</cite> was composed
as a war-song in which, after
recounting, one by one, their years
of exile, they numbered with the
same regularity, but in a contrary
direction, their deeds of vengeance!”</p>

<p>Such is the power of imagination.

<p>Let us give the literal translation
of the lines in which M. Olivier
finds such an expression of sublime
vengeance:</p>

<p>The first book in the Basque language

what changes the language has undergone

readily translated every

admired by the Baron von Humboldt.
Fortunately, it is not needed
to prove the valor of the Cantabrians
when their country was invaded
by the Romans, nor that of

took in Roncesvalles’ fearful fight.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="smaller">OUR IMPRESSIONS.</span></h4>

<p>It is probable that most of us
have been, at some time in our
intellectual and spiritual life, conscious
of a divergence between our
mental impressions and our received
belief respecting the nature and
characteristics of the divine Being.
Outside the closed-in boundaries
of our faith there has been, as it
were, a margin of waste land which
we seldom explore, but the undefined,
uncultivated products of which
flit athwart our imagination with
something like an uncomfortable
misgiving. We do not go far into it,
because we have our certain landmarks
to stand by; and while the
sun of faith shines bright on these,
we can say to ourselves that we
have nothing really to do with the
sort of fog-land which surrounds
our own happy enclosure. Our
allotment is one of peace within
the true fold of the church.</p>

<p>We know where we are; we
know what we have got to do; and
we refuse to be seriously troubled
by the dubious questions which
may possibly never disturb us, unless
we deliberately turn to them.</p>

<p>To us, as Catholics, this is a safe
resolve. We know the Church
cannot err. We believe, and are
ready, absolutely and unreservedly
ready, to believe, all she puts before
us as claiming our belief.
And this is no childish superstition.
It is no unmanly laying down of
our inalienable right to know good
from evil; it is no wilful deafness
or deliberate closing of our eyes.
It is the absolutely necessary and
perfectly inevitable result of the
one primary foundation of all our
belief&mdash;namely, that the church is
the organ of the Holy Ghost, the
infallible utterance of an infallible
voice, which voice is none other
and no less than the voice of God,
speaking through and by the divinely-instituted
kingdom which
comprises the church of God.
With this once firmly fixed in our
hearts and intellects, nothing, can
disturb us. Even supposing something
to be defined by the church
for which we were unprepared&mdash;as
was the case with some on the definition
of the Infallibility of the
Sovereign Pontiff&mdash;still these surprises,
if surprises they be, can be
no otherwise than sweet and welcome.
To us there cannot be a
jarring note in that voice which is
the voice of the Holy Ghost. The
trumpet cannot give a false sound.
It is our fault&mdash;either intellectually
our fault (which is rather a misfortune
than a fault) or spiritually
(which is from our negligence and
lukewarmness)&mdash;if the blast of that
trumpet painfully startle us from
our slumbers. To all who are
waking and watching the sound
can only be cheering and encouraging.
The good soldier is ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">[657]</a></span>
ready to hear it and prompt to
obey. The slumberer is among
those to whom our Lord says:
“You know how to discern the face
of the sky, and can you not know
the signs of the times?”<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>He evidently expects us to know
the signs of the times. The Lord
is not in the strong wind, nor is he
in the earthquake or the fire. He
is in the gentle air.<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> But the wind
and the earthquake and the fire are
his precursors, and those who have
experienced, and heard, and witnessed
these warnings should be
all attention for the softer sound
which is the utterance of the divine
Voice in the church.</p>

<p>There should be no surprise save
the surprise of a great joy, the admiring
astonishment of finding out
how good our God is, and what
marvellous treasures of things new
and old our great mother, the
church, lays before us from time to
time, as the Spirit of God moves
over the ocean of divine love, as
it were incubating the creations of
the world of grace. We lie down
in our certainty as the infant lies
down in its mother’s lap, and we
rise on the wings of hope and faith
as the lark rises in the morning
light, without the shadow of a
doubt that the lambient air will uphold
the little fluttering wings with
which it carries its joyous song to
the gates of heaven. Underneath
us are the “everlasting arms,”<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> and
therefore we “dwell in safety and
alone”&mdash;alone as regards those outside
the church, who cannot understand
our security, because they
have never grasped the idea that,
the voice of the church being the
voice of the third Person of the
ever-blessed Trinity to doubt the
church is the same as to say that
God is a liar.</p>

<p>If we have dwelt thus at length
upon our certitude, and upon the
intellectual and spiritual repose it
gives us, we have done so for the
purpose of making it absolutely
impossible for our readers to suppose
that when we speak of a divergence
between some of our mental
impressions and our received
belief, we are in any degree insinuating
that we have not got all we
require in the absolute and definite
teaching of the church; or that we
have any cause to feel troubled
about any question which the
church has left as an open question,
and respecting which any one
of us individually may have been
unable to arrive at a conclusion.
All we mean is this: that there are
certain feelings, impressions, and
imaginings which we find it hard to
silence and extinguish, difficult to
classify in accordance with our
substantial belief, and which hang
about us like a sail on the mast of
a vessel which the unwary crew
have left flapping in a dangerous
gale.</p>

<p>The points in question may be
various as the minds that contemplate
them. They may embrace a
variety of subjects, and may assume
different shapes and aspects,
according to the external circumstances
under which they present
themselves, or to the color of our
own thoughts and feelings at the
moment they are before us. Their
field is so vast and their possible
variety so great that it would be
vain for us to attempt to give even
a glance at them all. Indeed, the
doing so is beyond our capacity,
and would be beyond the capacity
of any one man. For who shall
tell what is fermenting in the
thoughts of one even of his fellow-beings?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[658]</a></span>
He can merely guess
blindly at the souls of others from
having dwelt in the depths of his
own, and knowing, as the one great
fact, that all men are brothers.</p>

<p>We are far, therefore, from intending
to take up all the possible questions
not hedged in and limited
and defined by dogmatic teaching,
or to try and help others to come
to a conclusion on each. We
might as well attempt to count the
sands of the sea-shore. All we are
proposing to ourselves for our own
consolation, and, if possible, for that
of our readers, is to lay hold of
certain facts which will give a clew
to other less certain facts, and, in
short&mdash;if we may be allowed to resort
to a chemical term&mdash;to indicate
certain solvents which will hold in
solution the little pebbles that lie
in our path, and which might grow
into great stumbling-blocks had we
not a strong dissolving power always
at our command.</p>

<p>It is self-evident that there is one
knowledge which contains all other
knowledge, and that is the knowledge
of God. As all things flow
from him, therefore all things are in
him; and if we could see or know
him, we should know all the rest.
That knowledge, that seeing, is the
“light of glory.” Its perfection
is only compatible with the Beatific
Vision, which vision is impossible to
mere man in his condition of <i lang="la">viator</i>,
or pilgrim.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> It is the conclusion of
faith just as broad noon is the
termination of darkness. But as
faith is the leading up to the
Beatific Vision, to the light of
glory, and to the knowledge of all
things, therefore in its degree is it
the best substitute for sight&mdash;the
dawning of a more perfect day, and
the beginning of knowledge. Consequently,
“faith is the evidence of
things that appear not.” And as
it is some of the things “that
appear not” which are puzzling and
bewildering many of us, let us lay
hold of our faith and go whither it
shall lead us.</p>

<p>We can in this life only know
God mediately and obscurely by
reason and faith. But as the direct
and clear intuition of God in
the Beatific Vision will include
the knowledge of all else, so even
our present imperfect knowledge
of him comprises in a certain
sense all other and lesser science,
and is necessary to the highest
knowledge of created things.</p>

<p>To do this thoroughly we will investigate
the occasional divergence
between our mental impressions,
as we sometimes experience them,
and our received belief of the
Divine Nature and characteristics.</p>

<p>In a burst of holy exultation S.
Paul asks, “Who hath known the
mind of the Lord?”<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>&mdash;not as though
regretting his ignorance, but rather
with the feelings of one who, having
suddenly come upon an evidently
priceless treasure, exclaims, Who
can tell what wealth now lies before
us?</p>

<p>Yes, indeed! we know him well
while we know him but imperfectly.
There is more to know than we can
guess at, but our hearts are too
narrow to hold it. And yet sometimes
how full to overflowing has
that knowledge seemed! Have we
not followed him from the cradle
to the grave, in that sweet brotherhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">[659]</a></span>
which he has established
with each one of us? Have we
not lost ourselves in far-reaching
thoughts of how, and where he
was when his brotherhood with
us was not an accomplished fact,
but only an ever-enduring divine
intention co-equal with his own
eternal existence&mdash;a phase of that
very existence, for ever present to
the Divine Idea, though not yet
subjected to the conditions of time?
We have thought of him as in the
bosom of the Father in a way in
which, wonderful to relate, he never
can be again in the bosom of the
Father. A something has passed in
respect to the existence of God
himself, and actually made a difference
in the extrinsic relations of
the divine Being.</p>

<p>There was an eternity in which
the Son of God&mdash;he whom we most
seem to know of the three Persons
of the ever-blessed Trinity&mdash;dwelt
in the bosom of the Father unconnected
with his sacred humanity.
There was an eternity when his
name was not Jesus, when he was
the Son of God only, and not the
Son of man.</p>

<p>We are expressing what everybody
knows who is a Christian&mdash;a
platitude almost, and yet so full
of wonder that, unless we have thoroughly
gone into it and sifted it,
we have not ransacked half the
riches of what we can and may
know of the “mind of the Lord.”</p>

<p>In truth, we are very apt to be
repelled by this contemplation.
There is something dreary to us in
the eternity when the Brother of
our race and the Spouse of our
souls was only the everlasting Begotten
of the Father, dwelling in
that inscrutable eternity to which
we, as the creatures of time, seem
to have no link. Our thoughts
and imaginations are shackled by
the conditions of our own being.
Yesterday we were not. And so
all before yesterday seems like a
blank to us. To-morrow we know
will be&mdash;if not for us in this identical
state, yet certainly for us in
some other state. But that dim
yesterday, which never began and
of which no history can be written,
no details given, only the great,
grand, inarticulated statement made
that the <span class="smcap">Qui Est</span>, the “I am,” filled
it&mdash;this appalls us. Can nothing be
done to mitigate this stupendous
though beautiful horror? Is there
no corner into which our insignificance
can creep, that so we may
look out upon those unknown
depths without feeling that we are
plunging into a fathomless ocean,
there to sink in blank darkness and
inanition? Surely the God of the
past (as from our point of view we
reckon the past) should not be so
appallingly unknown to us who
have our beloved Jesus in the present,
and who look forward to the
Beatific Vision of the whole blessed
Trinity with trembling hope in the
future. But before we can in any
degree overcome the stupor with
which we think of the backward-flowing
ages of eternity, we must endeavor
more fully to realize the nature
of time.</p>

<p>We are all apt to speak of time
as a period; whereas it is more
properly a state.</p>

<p>The generality of persons, in
thinking of time in relation to eternity,
represent to themselves a long,
long ago, blind past, and then an
interminable but partially appreciable
future, and time lying as a
sort of sliced-out period between
the two, which slice is attached to
the eternity behind and the eternity
in front, and about which we have
the comfort and satisfaction of being
able to write history and chronicle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[660]</a></span>
events, either on a large or a
small scale. We treat it as we
should do a mountain of gold,
which we coin into money, and we
conveniently cut it up into ages,
years, months, days, and hours. It
is our nature so to do, and we cannot
do otherwise. It is the condition
of our being. But as it will
not be always the condition of our
being, there are few things we are
more constantly exhorted to than
the attempt to raise our imagination,
or rather our faith, as much
as possible out of these conventional
and arbitrary trammels, and
dispose ourselves for that other
state which is our ultimate end,
and where there are no years and
no days.</p>

<p>In point of fact, time is only an
imperfection of our being&mdash;an absolutely
necessary imperfection, because
our being is finite, and our
state is a probationary state; and
probation implies not only that
succession which is necessary in
every finite being, but change and
movement in respect to things
which are permanent in a more perfect
state. Our condition in time
has not inaptly been compared to
that of a man looking through the
small aperture of a camera-obscura,
which only permits him to behold
a section of what is passing. The
figures appear and vanish. But
the window is thrown wide open in
eternity, and he sees the whole at
once. He is, therefore, under a
disadvantage so long as he is in the
camera-obscura, viewing the landscape
through a small hole. And
this is our position, judging of
eternity through the aperture of
time. Even now we have a wonderful
power of adding to our time,
or of shortening it, without any reference
to clocks or sun-dials, and
which, if we think about it, will
help to show us that time is a plastic
accident of our being.</p>

<p>When we have been very much
absorbed, we have taken no note
of time, and the hours have flown
like minutes. During that interval
we have, as it were, made our own
time, and modified our condition
with reference to time by our own
act. Time, therefore, is plastic.
Were we by some extraordinary
and exceptional power to accomplish
in one day all that actually
we now take a year to effect, but at
the same time intellectually to retain
our present perception of the
succession of events, our life would
not really have been shorter for the
want of those three hundred and
sixty-four days which we had been
able to do without. Life is shorter
now than it was in the days of the
patriarchs. But possibly the perception
of life is not shortened.
Nay, rather, from the rapidity with
which events are now permitted to
succeed each other, partially owing
to the progress of science and to
man’s increased dominion over material
force, the probability is that
our lives are not abstractedly much,
if at all, more brief than Adam’s
nine hundred and thirty years. All
things now are hastening to the
end. They have always been hastening.
But there is the added
impetus of the past; and that increases
with every age in the world’s
history.</p>

<p>Now, let us imagine life, or a
portion of life, without thought&mdash;that
is, without the act of thinking.
Immediately we find that it is next
door to <em>no thing</em>, to no time, and
no life. We can only measure life
with any accuracy by the amount
of thought which has filled it&mdash;that
is, by the quantity of our intellectual
and spiritual power which we
have been able to bring to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">[661]</a></span>
small aperture in the camera-obscura,
by which to contemplate the
ever-flowing eternity which lies beyond,
and cut it up into the sections
we call time.</p>

<p>Another example will show us
how plastic is the nature of time.
Take the life of an animal. We are
inclined to give the largest reasonable
and possible importance to the
brute creation. It is an open question,
in which we see great seeds of
future development, all tending to
increased glory to the Creator and
to further elucidation of creative
love. Nevertheless, it is obvious
that brutes perceive only or chiefly
by moments. There is, as compared
with ourselves, little or no sequence
in their perceptions. There
is no cumulative knowledge. They
are without deliberate reflection,
even where they are not without
perception of relations and circumstances,
past or future. Consequently,
they are more rigorously
subjects to time than ourselves.
Therefore, when we deprive an animal
of life, we deprive him of a remainder
of time that is equal to little
more than no time, in proportion
to the degree in which his power of
filling time with perception is less
than our own.<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> All we have said
tends to prove that the existence of
time is a relative existence; it is
the form or phase of our own finite
being. It is an aspect of eternity&mdash;the
aspect which is consistent with
our present condition. For time is
the measure of successive existence
in created and finite beings. As
finite spirits we cannot escape from
this limit of successive existence,
any more than a body can escape
from the limit of locality and finite
movement in grace. Eternal existence
is the entire possession of life,
which is illimitable, in such a perfect
manner that all succession in
duration is excluded. This is possible
only in God himself, who is
alone most pure and perfect act,
and therefore is at once all he can
be, without change or movement.
But the created spirit must ever
live by a perpetual movement of increase
in its duration, because it is
on every side finite. Time, therefore,
will continue to exist while
creatures continue to exist.</p>

<p>Having arrived at this conclusion
we cannot refuse ourselves the satisfaction
of pointing out one obvious
deduction&mdash;namely, that if
time has, in itself, only a relative
existence, it is impossible it can
ever put an end to the existence
of anything else. It is inconceivable
that the <i lang="la">non est</i> can absorb, exterminate,
annihilate, or obliterate
any one single thing that has ever
had one second of real existence,
of permitted being, of sentient, or
even of insentient, life. God can
annihilate, if he so will (and we do
not think he will), but time cannot.
Time can hide and put away. It
can slip between us and the only
reality, which is eternity; that is
the condition of God, the <span class="smcap">Qui Est</span>.
Wait awhile, and time will have, as
it were, spread or overflowed into
eternity. It will hide nothing from
our view. It will be “rent in two
from the top to the bottom,” from
the beginning to the end, like the
veil of the Temple, which is its symbol.
And then will appear all that
it has hitherto seemed, but only
seemed, to distinguish. We shall
find it all in the inner recesses of
eternity. What cause, in point of
fact, have we for supposing that
anything which <em>is</em> shall cease to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">[662]</a></span>
exist? Why, because we no longer
behold certain objects, do we imagine
them to be really lost for ever?
Is this a reasonable supposition on
the part of beings who are conscious
that once they themselves
were not, and yet believe that they
always shall be? Why should the
mere diversity in other existences
make us apprehend that the missing
is also the lost, and that we
have any substantial cause for
doubting that all which exists will go
on existing? Do we anywhere see
symptoms of annihilation? It is
true we see endless mutations, but
those very mutations are a guarantee
to us of the continuousness of
being. All material things change:
but they only change. They do
not ever in any case go out and
cease to be. If this be true of
merely material things, how absolutely
true must it be of the immaterial;
and how more than probable
of that which is partly one
and partly the other, of that far
lower nature of the brutes, which
have a principle of life in them inferior
to ours and superior to the
plants, and of which, since we do
not believe their sensations to be
the result of certain fortuitous
atoms that have fashioned themselves
blindly after an inexorable
law, and independently of an intelligent
Lawgiver, we may reasonably
predicate that they too will
have a future and, in its proper
inferior order, an advanced existence.
Everywhere there is growth&mdash;through
the phases of time into
the portals of eternity.</p>

<p>The idea in the eternal Mind, of
all essences, the least as well as the
greatest, was, like the Mind that
held it, eternal&mdash;that is, exempt from
all limit of succession. The past,
present, and future are the progressive
modes of existence and of
our own perceptions rather than
the properties of the essences themselves.
Those essences had a place
in the Eternal Idea; they occupy an
actual place as an actual existence
in the phases of time, and they go
on in all probability&mdash;may we not
say in all certainty?&mdash;in the endlessness
of the Creator’s intention.
Let no one misunderstand this as
implying that matter was eternal in
any other sense than its essence
being an object of the idea of the
eternal God, it was always clearly
present to the eternal Mind. Its
actuality, as we know it, dates from
this creation of the crude, chaotic
mass. But once formed, and then
fashioned, and finally animated, we
can have no pretence for supposing
that any part of it will ever
cease to be. Nor can we have any
solid reason for supposing that what
has once been endowed with sentient
life will ever be condemned to
fall back into the all but infinitely
lower form of mere organic matter,
any more than we have reason to
suppose that at some future period
organic matter will be reduced to
inorganic matter, and that out of
this beautiful creation it will please
God to resolve chaos back again,
either the whole or in any one the
smallest part. We have nothing to
do with the difficulties of the question.
They are difficulties entirely
of detail, and not of principle;
and they concern us no more than
it concerns us to be able to state
how many animalcula it took to
heave up the vast sierras of the
western hemisphere. The details
may well puzzle us, and we cannot
venture on the merest suggestion.
But the principle is full of hope,
joy, and security, which in itself
is a presumption in its favor. If
we would but believe how God
values the work of his own hands;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">[663]</a></span>
if we would but try to realize how
intense is creative love, what much
larger and deeper views we should
have of the future of all creation,
and of the glory that is prepared
for us! Even the old heathen religions
began by taking larger and
more accurate measure of these
questions (though they necessarily
ended in error) than too many of
us do with all the light of the Gospel
thrown upon them. The animism
of the heathens, which makes
no distinction between animate and
inanimate existence, but lends a
soul to each alike, had in it a sort
of loving and hopeful reverence
for creation which is often wanting
to us who alone truly know the
Creator. In their blind groping
after faith it led them to fetichism,
and further on, as a fuller development
of the same notion, to pantheism,
and then to the ever-renewed
and quite endless incarnations
of Buddha. But these errors took
their rise originally from a respectful
and tender love of that beautiful
though awful nature which man
found lying all around him; external
to himself, yet linked to himself,
and beneath the folds of
which he hoped to find the hidden
deity.</p>

<p>If these reflections have at all
enabled us to understand the nature
of time, and to shake off some
of the unreasonable importance we
lend to it in our imaginations&mdash;making
of it a sort of lesser rival to
eternity, fashioning it into an actual,
existing thing, as if it were an
attribute of God himself, instead
of being, what it is, a state or
phase imposed upon us, and not
in any way affecting him&mdash;we shall
have done much to facilitate the
considerations we wish to enlarge
upon. Eternity is “perpetually
instantaneous.” It is the <i lang="la">nunc stans</i>
of theology. Time, on the contrary,
is the past, present, and future
of our human condition&mdash;the
<i lang="la">nunc fluens</i> of theology.</p>

<p>With this truth well rooted in
our minds, we will now turn to the
investigation of some of those impressions
to which we referred at
the beginning of this section, and
endeavor to throw light upon them
from out of the additional knowledge
we acquire of the nature and
characteristics of the divine Being
through the simple process of clearing
away some of our false impressions
with respect to time. We had
in our modes of thought more or
less hemmed in the Eternal, with
our human sense of time, and subjected
even him to the narrowing
process of a past, present, and future.
Now we are about to think
of ourselves only in that position,
and to contemplate him in eternity,
dealing with us through the
medium of time, but distinctly with
a reference to eternity, and only
apparently imposing on himself the
conditions of time in order to bring
himself, as it were, on a level with
us in his dealings with us.</p>

<p>Strange as it may appear, out of
the depths of our stupidity we have
fabricated a difficulty to ourselves
in his very condescensions, and,
looking back from our present to
the past, we find ourselves puzzled
at certain divers revelations of God
made to mankind in gone-by times;
just as, in the weakness of our faith,
we are sometimes troubled with
doubts about our own condition,
and that of those about us, in that
future which must come, and which
may not be far off to any one of us.</p>

<p>The God of Abraham, and Isaac,
and Jacob&mdash;is he really quite the
same as our own God? our God
of the womb of Mary, of the manger,
of the wayside places in Palestine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">[664]</a></span>
and Mount Calvary, and now,
of the silken-curtained Tabernacle,
and the Blessed Eucharist, and the
dear, ineffable moments of silent
prayer&mdash;is he the same?</p>

<p>Of course we know that, literally
and absolutely, he is the same yesterday,
to-day, and for ever. Nevertheless,
he appears to us under
such different aspects that we find
ourselves unintentionally contemplating
the Old Testament as a
revelation of the divine Being with
very different emotions from those
with which we contemplate him in
the New Testament, and this, again,
differing widely from our view of
him in the church. It may be a mere
matter of feeling, perhaps; but it is
nevertheless a feeling which materially
influences our form of devotion,
the vigor of our faith, and the
power of our hope and love.</p>

<p>If we could take in all these different
impressions and amalgamate
them; if we could group them together,
or make them like the several
rays of light directed into one
focus, we should obtain a more
complete and a more influential
knowledge of God than we can do
while we seem rather to be wandering
out of one view of him into another,
as if we walked from chamber
to chamber and closed each
door behind us.</p>

<p>Now, the only way we can arrive
at this is by bearing in mind that
the acts of God in governing the
world are not momentary and solitary
facts, but continuous acts, or
rather one continuous act.</p>

<p>Our difficulty lies in producing a
visibly satisfactory harmony in our
own minds as regards the acts of
God, and thus (though for our
own appreciation of them, they are
to us broken up into fragments, or,
in other terms, into separate facts)
arriving at the same mental attitude
towards them as though we saw
them as one continuous act.</p>

<p>It will aid us in our search if we,
first of all, endeavor to qualify that
act.</p>

<p>Its very continuity, its perpetual
instantaneousness, must essentially
affect its character and make the
definition no complex matter. It
is an act of love, and it is revealed
as such in the whole creation, and
in the way God has let himself down
to us and is drawing us up unto
himself. There have been many
apparent modifications, but there
have been no actual contradictions,
in this characteristic; for even the
existence of evil works round to
greater good, to a degree sufficiently
obvious to us for us to know that
where it is less obvious it must
nevertheless follow the same law.
For law is everywhere; because
God is law, though law is not God.</p>

<p>Modern unbelief substitutes law
for God, and then thinks it has
done away with him. To us who
believe it makes no difference how
far back in the long continuous line
of active forces we may find the
original and divine Author of all
force. It is nothing but the weakness
of our imagination which
makes it more difficult to count by
millions than by units.</p>

<p>What does it matter to our faith
through how many developments
the condition of creation, as we
now see it all around us, may
have passed, when we know that
the first idea sprang from the great
Source of all law, and that with him
the present state is as much one
continuous act as the past state
and the future state? You may
trace back the whole material universe,
if you will, to the one first
molecule of chaotic matter; but
so long as I find that first molecule
in the hand of my Creator (and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">[665]</a></span>
defy you to put it anywhere else),
it is enough for my faith.</p>

<p>You do not make him one whit
the less my Creator and my God
because an initial law or force,
with which he then stamped it, has
worked it out to what I now see it.
You may increase the apparent distance
between the world as it is
actually and the divine Fount from
whence it sprang; you may seem
to remove the creative love which
called the universe into existence
further off, by thus lengthening the
chain of what you call developments;
but, after all, these developments
are for ever bridged over by
the ulterior intentions of the Triune
Deity when he said,“Let us make
man in our image,” and by the fact
that space and time are mere accidents
as viewed in relation to the
<span class="smcap">Qui Est</span>. They are, so to speak,
divinely-constituted conventionalities,
through which the Divinity
touches upon our human condition,
but which in no way affect the
Divine Essence as it is in itself. On
the contrary, in the broken-up developments
and evolutions which
you believe you trace, and which
you want to make into a blind law
which shall supersede a divine
Creator, I see only the pulsations
of time breaking up the perpetually
instantaneous act of God, just as I
see the pulsations of light in the
one unbroken ray. The act of
God passes through the medium of
time before it reaches our ken;
and the ray of light passes through
the medium of air before it strikes
our senses; but both are continuous
and instantaneous.</p>

<p>If we have in any degree succeeded
in establishing this to our
satisfaction, it will become easier
for us to estimate the acts of God
as they come to us through the
pulsations of Time; because we
shall be able to bear in mind that
they must be in a measure interpreted
to us by the time through
which they reach us. They were
modified by the time in which they
were revealed, much as the ray is
modified by the substance through
which it forces its way to us.</p>

<p>Now, we arrive at the causes of
the different impressions we receive
of the nature and characteristics of
the divine Being. They are a consequence
of the different epochs in
which we contemplate him. They
are the pulsations appropriate to
that epoch. Other pulsations belong
to our portion of time, and to
our consequent view of the divine
Being; and so on and on, till
time shall be swallowed up in Eternity,
and the Beatific Vision burst
upon us.</p>

<h3>MISSIONS IN MAINE FROM 1613 TO 1854.</h3>

<p class="center smaller">“THE BLOOD OF THE MARTYRS IS THE SEED OF THE CHURCH.”</p>

<p>To the historical student the following
paper can have but trifling
value, as the writer makes no pretension
to originality of matter,
and seeks but to bring within the
grasp of the general reader, in a
condensed form, the gist of many
books, a large number of which are
rare, and almost inaccessible.</p>

<p>It is hoped, however, that there
are many persons who will read
with interest a paper thus compiled
from undoubted authorities, who
have neither the time nor the inclination
to consult these authorities for
themselves. These persons will
learn with wonder of the self-abnegation
of the French priests who
went forth among the savages with
their lives in their hands, with but
one thought in their brains, one
wish in their hearts, one prayer on
their lips&mdash;the evangelization of the
Indians.</p>

<p>As Shea says: “The word Christianity
was, in those days, identical
with Catholicity. The religion to
be offered to the New World was
that of the Church of Rome, which
church was free from any distinct
national feeling, and in extending
her boundaries carried her own language
and rites, not those of any
particular state.”</p>

<p>The Franciscan, Dominican, and
Jesuit bore the heat and burden of
the day, and reaped the most bountiful
harvest in that part of North
America now known as the State of
Maine; and the first mission in that
neighborhood was planted at Mt.
Desert, and called St. Sauveur.
A hotel at Bar Harbor is so named,
but not one in a hundred of the numerous
guests who cross its threshold
knows the reason of the French
name of their temporary abiding-place.</p>

<p>This reason, and the facts connected
therewith, we shall now proceed
to give to our readers. In
1610 Marie de Médicis was Regent
of France. The king had been
assassinated in the streets of Paris
in the previous month of May.
Sully was dismissed from court.
All was confusion and dissension.
Twelve years of peace and the judicious
rule of the king had paid
the national debt and filled the
treasury.</p>

<p>The famous Father Cotton, confessor
of the late king, was still
powerful at court. He laid before
the queen the facts that Henri IV.
had been deeply interested in the
establishment of the Jesuit order in
Acadia, and had evinced a tangible
proof of that interest in the
bestowal of a grant of two thousand
livres per annum.</p>

<p>The ambitious queen listened indulgently,
with a heart softened,
possibly, by recent sorrows, and
consented to receive the son of the
Baron Poutrincourt, who had just
returned from the New World, where
he had left his father with Champlain.
Father Cotton ushered the
handsome stripling into the presence
of the stately queen and her
attendant ladies. Young Biencourt
at first stood silent and abashed,
but, as the ladies gathered about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">[667]</a></span>
him and plied him with questions,
soon forgot himself and told wondrous
tales of the dusky savages&mdash;of
their strange customs and of their
eagerness for instruction in the true
faith. He displayed the baptismal
register of the converts of Father
Fléche, and implored the sympathy
and aid of these glittering dames,
and not in vain; for, fired with
pious emulation, they tore the flashing
jewels from their ears and
throats. Among these ladies was
one whose history and influence
were so remarkable that we must
translate for our readers some account
of her from the Abbé de
Choisy.</p>

<p>Antoinette de Pons, Marquise de
Guercheville had been famed
throughout France, not only for
her grace and beauty, but for qualities
more rare at the court where
her youth had been passed.</p>

<p>When Antoinette was La Duchesse
de Rochefoucauld, the king begged
her to accept a position near the
queen. “Madame,” he said, as he
presented her to Marie de Médicis,
“I give you a Lady of Honor who is
a lady of honor indeed.”</p>

<p>Twenty years had come and gone.
The youthful beauty of the <i lang="fr">marquise</i>
had faded, but she was fair
and stately still, and one of the
most brilliant ornaments of the
brilliant court; and yet she was not
altogether worldly. Again a widow
and without children, she had become
sincerely religious, and threw
herself heart and soul into the
American missions, and was restrained
only by the positive commands
of her mistress the queen
from herself seeking the New
World.</p>

<p>Day and night she thought of
these perishing souls. On her knees
in her oratory she prayed for the
Indians, and contented herself
not with this alone. From the
queen and from the ladies of the
court she obtained money, and
jewels that could be converted
into money. Charlevoix tells us
that the only difficulty was to restrain
her ardor within reasonable
bounds.</p>

<p>Two French priests, Paul Biard
and Enémond Massé, were sent to
Dieppe, there to take passage for
the colonies. The vessel was engaged
by Poutrincourt and his associates,
and was partially owned by
two Huguenot merchants, who persistently
and with indignation refused
to permit the embarkation
of the priests. No entreaties or
representations availed, and finally
La Marquise bought out the interest
of the two merchants in the
vessel and cargo, and transferred
it to the priests as a fund for their
support.</p>

<p>At last the fathers set sail, on
the 26th of January, 1611. Their
troubles, however, were by no means
over; for Biencourt, a mere lad,
clothed in a little brief authority&mdash;manly,
it is true, beyond his years&mdash;hampered
them at every turn.
They arrived at Port Royal in June,
after a hazardous and tempestuous
voyage, having seen, as Father Biard
writes, icebergs taller and larger
than the Church of Notre Dame.
The fathers became discouraged
by the constant interference of
young Biencourt, and determined
to return to Europe, unless they
could, with Mme. de Guercheville’s
aid, found a mission colony in some
other spot.</p>

<p>Their zealous protectress obtained
from De Monts&mdash;who, though
a Protestant, had erected six years
before the first cross in Maine at the
mouth of the Kennebec&mdash;a transfer
of all his claims to the lands of
Acadia, and soon sent out a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">[668]</a></span>
vessel with forty colonists, commanded
by La Saussaye, a nobleman,
and having on board two Jesuit
priests, Fathers du Thet and Quentin.</p>

<p>It was on the 1st of March, 1613,
that this vessel left Honfleur, laden
with supplies, and followed by
prayers and benedictions.</p>

<p>On the 16th of May La Saussaye
reached Port Royal, and there
took on board Fathers Massé and
Biard, and then set sail for the
Penobscot. A heavy fog arose and
encompassed them about; if it lifted
for a moment, it was but to
show them a white gleam of distant
breakers or a dark, overhanging
cliff.</p>

<p>“Our prayers were heard,” wrote
Biard, “and at night the stars
came out, and the morning sun
devoured the fogs, and we found
ourselves lying in Frenchmans
Bay opposite Mt. Desert.”</p>

<p>L’Isle des Monts Déserts had
been visited and so named by
Champlain in 1604, and Frenchman’s
Bay gained its title from a
singular incident that had there
taken place in the same spring.</p>

<p>De Monts had broken up his
winter encampment at St. Croix.
Among his company was a young
French ecclesiastic, Nicholas d’Aubri,
who, to gratify his curiosity in
regard to the products of the soil
in this new and strange country,
insisted on being set ashore for a
ramble of a few hours. He lost his
way, and the boatmen, after an
anxious search, were compelled to
leave him. For eighteen days the
young student wandered through
woods, subsisting on berries and
the roots of the plant known as
Solomon’s Seal. He, however,
kept carefully near the shore, and
at the end of this time he distinguished
a sail in the distance. Signalling
this, he was fortunate enough
to be taken off by the same crew
that had landed him. On these
bleak shores the colonists decided
to make their future home, and, with
singular infelicity, selected them as
the site of the new colony. It is
inconceivable how Father Biard,
who had already spent some time
in the New World, could have failed
to suggest to La Saussaye and
to their patroness that a colony, to
be a success, must be not only in
a spot easily accessible to France,
but that a small force of armed
men was imperative; for, to Biard’s
own knowledge, the English had already
seized several French vessels
in that vicinity.</p>

<p>On these frowning shores La
Saussaye landed, and erected a
cross, and displayed the escutcheon
of Mme. de Guercheville; the
fathers offered the Holy Sacrifice
of the Mass, and gave to the little
settlement the name of St. Sauveur.</p>

<p>Four tents&mdash;the gift of the queen&mdash;shone
white in the soft spring
sunshine. The largest of these was
used as a chapel, the decorations
of which, with the silver vessels for
the celebration of the Mass and
the rich vestments, were presented
by Henriette d’Entraigues, Marquise
de Verneuil.</p>

<p>The colonists labored night and
day to raise their little fort and to
land their supplies. Their toil
was nearly over, the vessel, ready
for sea, rode at anchor, when a sudden
and violent storm arose.</p>

<p>This storm had been felt twenty-four
hours earlier off the Isles of
Shoals by a fishing vessel commanded
by one Samuel Argall. Thick
fogs bewildered him, and a strong
wind drove him to the northeast;
and when the weather cleared,
Argall found himself off the coast
of Maine. Canoes came out like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">[669]</a></span>
flocks of birds from each small bay.
The Indians climbed the ship’s
side, and greeted the new-comers
with such amazing bows and flourishes
that Argall, with his native
acuteness, felt certain that they
could have learned them only from
the French, who could not be far
away. Argall plied the Indians
with cunning questions, and soon
learned of the new settlement. He
resolved to investigate farther, and
set sail for the wild heights of Mt.
Desert. With infinite patience he
crept along through the many
islands, and, rounding the Porcupines,
saw a small ship anchored in
the bay. At the same moment the
French saw the English ship bearing
down upon them “swifter than
an arrow,” writes Father Biard,
“with every sail set, and the English
flags streaming from mast-head
and stern.”</p>

<p>La Saussaye was within the fort,
Lieut. la Motte on board with Father
du Thet, an ensign, and a
sergeant. Argall bore down amid
a bewildering din of drums and
trumpets. “Fire!” cried La Motte.
Alas! the gunner was on shore.
Father du Thet seized and applied
the match.</p>

<p>Another scathing discharge of
musketry, and the brave priest lay
dead. He had his wish; for the
day before he left France he prayed
with uplifted hands that he
might not return, but perish on that
holy enterprise. He was buried
the following day at the foot of the
rough cross he had helped to erect.</p>

<p>La Motte, clear-sighted enough
to see the utter uselessness of any
farther attempt at defence, surrendered,
and Argall took possession
of the vessel and of La Saussaye’s
papers, from among which he abstracted
the royal commission. On
La Saussaye’s return from the
woods, where he had retreated with
the colonists, he was met by Argall,
who informed him that the country
belonged to his master, King James,
and finally asked to see his commission.
In vain did the French
nobleman search for it. Argall’s
courtesy changed to wrath; he accused
the officer of piracy, and ordered
the settlement to be given up
to pillage, but offered to take any
of the settlers who had a trade back
to Virginia with him, promising them
protection. Argall counted, however,
without his host; for on reaching
Jamestown the governor swore
that the French priests should be
hung. Useless were Argall’s remonstrances,
and finally, seeing no
other way to save the lives of the
fathers, he produced the commission
and acknowledged his stratagem.</p>

<p>The wrath of Sir Thomas Dale
was unappeased, but the lives of
the priests were, of course, safe.
He despatched Argall with two additional
ships back to Mt. Desert,
with orders to cut down the cross
and level the defences.</p>

<p>Father Biard was on board, as
well as Father Massé; they, with refined
cruelty, being sent to witness
the destruction of their hopes.</p>

<p>This work of destruction completed,
Argall set sail for Virginia.
Again a storm arose, and the vessel
on which were the ecclesiastics was
driven to the Azores. Here the
Jesuits, who had been so grossly
ill-treated, had but a few words to
say to be avenged. The captain
of the vessel was not without uneasiness,
and entreated the priests
to remain in concealment when the
vessel was visited by the authorities.
This visit over, the English
purchased all they needed, and
weighed anchor for England. Arrived
there, a new difficulty occurred;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">[670]</a></span>
for there was no commission
to show. The captain was treated
as a pirate, thrown into prison, and
released only on the testimony of
the Jesuit Fathers, who thus returned
good for evil.</p>

<p>Father Biard hastened to France,
where he became professor of theology
at Lyons, and died at Avignon
on the 17th of November,
1622. Father Massé returned to
Canada, where he labored without
ceasing until his death, in 1646.</p>

<p>With the destruction of St. Sauveur,
the pious designs of Mme. de
Guercheville seem to have perished.
At any rate, the most diligent
research fails to find her name
again in the annals of that time.
Probably the troubled state of
France made it impossible for her
to provide the sinews of war, or of
evangelization. Nevertheless, the
good seed was planted, and zeal
for the mission cause again revived
in Europe, particularly in the Society
of Jesus. Young men left
court and camp to share the privations
and life of self-denial of the
missionaries. Even the convents
partook of the general enthusiasm,
and Ursuline Nuns came to show
the Indians Christianity in daily
life, ministering to the sick and
instructing the young.</p>

<p>Many years after the melancholy
failure of the mission at Mt. Desert,
an apparent accident recalled
the Jesuit Fathers to the coast
of Maine.</p>

<p>In 1642 there was a mission at
Sillery, on the St. Lawrence, where
had been gathered together a large
number of Indian converts, who
lived, with their families about them,
in peace and harmony under the
watchful care of the kind fathers.
Among these converts was a chief
who, to rescue some of his tribe
who had been taken prisoners, started
off through the pathless wilderness,
and finally reached the English
at Coussinoe, now known as
Augusta, on the Kennebec.</p>

<p>There the Indian convert so extolled
the Christian faith and its
mighty promises that he took back
with him several of the tribe.
These were baptized at Sillery, and
became faithful servants of our
Lord Jesus Christ. In consequence
of the entreaties of these
converts, Father Gabriel Drouillettes
was sent to the lonely Kennebec.</p>

<p>Here he built a chapel of fir-trees
in a place now known as
Norridgewock, a lovely, secluded
spot. Some years before Father
Biard had been there for a few
weeks, so that the Indians were not
totally unprepared to receive religious
instruction. Father Drouillettes
was greatly blessed in his
teaching, and converted a large
number, inspiring them with a profound
love for the Catholic faith,
which the English, twenty years
before, had failed to do for the Protestant
religion. He taught them
simple prayers, and translated for
their use, into their own dialect,
several hymns. The savages even
learned to sing, and it was not long
before the solemn strains of the
<cite>Dies Iræ</cite> awakened strange echoes
in the primeval forests.</p>

<p>Even the English, biassed as they
were against the Catholics, watched
the good accomplished by the faithful
servant of the great Master,
and learned to regard his coming
as a great blessing, though at this
very time the stern Puritans at
Plymouth were enacting cruel laws
against his order.</p>

<p>When the Indians went to Moosehead
Lake to hunt and fish, Father
Drouillettes went with them, watching
over his flock with unswerving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">[671]</a></span>
solicitude. But the day of his
summons to Quebec came, and a
general feeling of despair overwhelmed
his converts. He went,
and the Assumption Mission was
deserted; for by that name, as it
was asked for on that day, was
this mission always designated.</p>

<p>Year after year the Abnakis&mdash;for
so were called the aborigines of
Maine&mdash;sent deputations to Quebec
to entreat the return of their beloved
priest, but in vain; for the
number of missionaries was at that
time very limited. Finally, in 1650,
Father Drouillettes set out with a
party on the last day of August for
the tiresome eight days’ march
through the wilderness; the party
lost their way, their provisions were
gone, and it was not until twenty-four
days afterwards that they reached
Norridgewock.</p>

<p>From a letter written at this time
by Father Drouillettes we transcribe
the following: “In spite of all that
is painful and crucifying to nature
in these missions, there are also
great joys and consolations. More
plenteous than I can describe are
those I feel, to see that the seed of
the Gospel I scattered here four
years ago, in land which for so
many centuries has lain fallow, or
produced only thorns and brambles,
already bears fruit so worthy of the
Lord.” Nothing could exceed the
veneration and affection of the
Indians for their missionary; and
when an Englishman vehemently
accused the French priest of slandering
his nation, the chiefs hurried
to Augusta, and warned the authorities
to take heed and not attack
their father even in words.</p>

<p>The following spring Father
Drouillettes was sent to a far-distant
station, and years elapsed before he
returned to Quebec, where he died
in 1681, at the age of eighty-eight.</p>

<p>About this time two brothers,
Vincent and Jacques Bigot, men
of rank and fortune, left their homes
in sunny France to share the toil
and privations of life in the New
World. They placed themselves
and their fortunes in the hands of
the superior at Quebec, and were
sent to labor in the footprints of
Father Drouillettes. During their
faithful ministrations at Norridgewock,
the chapel built by their predecessor
was burned by the English,
but was rebuilt in 1687 by English
workmen sent from Boston,
according to treaty stipulations.
And now appears upon the scene
the stately form of one of the greatest
men of that age; but before we
attempt to bring before our readers
the character and acts of Sebastian
Râle, we must beg them to turn from
Norridgewock, the scene of his
labors and martyrdom, to the little
village of Castine. For in 1688
Father Thury, a priest of the
diocese of Quebec, a man of tact
and ability, had gathered about
him a band of converts at Panawauski,
on the Penobscot. This
settlement was protected by the
Baron Saint-Castine. This Saint-Castine
was a French nobleman
and a soldier who originally went to
Canada in command of a regiment.
The regiment was disbanded, and
Saint-Castine’s disappointed ambition
and a heart sore from domestic
trials decided him, rather
than return to France, to plunge
into the wilderness, and there, far
from kindred and nation, create for
himself a new home.</p>

<p>After a while the baron married a
daughter of one of the sachems of the
Penobscot Indians, and became himself
a sagamore of the tribe. The
descendants of this marriage hold at
the present day some portion of the
Saint-Castine lands in Normandy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[672]</a></span></p>

<p>Twice was the French baron
driven from his home by the
Dutch; twice was the simple chapel
burned by them. In 1687 Sir
Edmund Andros was appointed
governor of New England, and in
the following year, sailing eastward
in the frigate <i>Rose</i>, he anchored
opposite the little fort and primitive
home of Saint-Castine. The
baron retreated with the small
band of settlers to the woods.
Andros, being a Catholic, touched
nothing in the chapel, but carried
off everything else in the village.
In 1703 the war known as Queen
Anne’s war broke out. Again
Saint-Castine was attacked by the
English, and his wife and children
carried off as prisoners, but were
soon after exchanged. From this
time the name of Baron Saint-Castine
appears in all the annals of the
time, as the courageous defender of
his faith and of its priests. Father
Râle, at Norridgewock, turned to
him for counsel and aid, and never
turned in vain. From Castine on
to Mt. Desert the shores are full of
historical interest; for there were
many French settlements thereabouts,
the attention of that nation
having been drawn to that especial
locality by a grant of land which
M. Cardillac obtained of Louis
XIV. in April, 1691. This grant
was evidently made to confirm possession.
A certain Mme. de Grégoire
proved herself to be a lineal
descendant of Cardillac, and in
1787 acquired a partial confirmation
of the original grant.</p>

<p>Relics of the French settlers are
constantly turned up by the plough
in the vicinity of Castine, and in
1840 a quantity of French gold
pieces were found; but of infinitely
more interest was the discovery
there, in 1863, of a copper plate
ten inches in length and eight in
width. The finder, knowing nothing
of the value of this piece of
metal, cut off a portion to repair his
boat. This fragment was, however,
subsequently recovered. The letters
on the plate are unquestionably
abbreviations of the following
inscription: “1648, 8 Junii, S. Frater
Leo Parisiensis, in Capuccinorum
Missione, posuit hoc fundamentum
in honorem nostræ Dominæ Sanctæ
Spei”&mdash;1648, 8th of June, Holy Friar
Leo of Paris, Capuchin missionary,
laid this foundation in honor of
Our Lady of Holy Hope.</p>

<p>In regard to this Father Leo the
most diligent research fails to find
any other trace. The plate, however,
was without doubt placed in
the foundation of a Catholic chapel&mdash;probably
the one within the walls
of the old French fort. Father
Sebastian Râle sailed in 1689 for
America. After remaining for nearly
two years in Quebec, he went
thence to Norridgewock. He found
the Abnakis nearly all converted,
and at once applied himself to
learning their dialect. To this
work he brought his marvellous patience
and energy, and all his wondrous
insight into human nature.
He began his dictionary, and erected
a chapel on the spot known now
as Indian Old Point. This chapel
he supplied with all the decorations
calculated to engage the imagination
and fix the wandering attention
of the untutored savage. The women
contended with holy emulation
in the embellishment of the sanctuary.
They made mats of the soft
and brightly-tinted plumage of the
forest birds and of the white-breasted
sea-gulls. They brought offerings
of huge candles, manufactured
from the fragrant wax of the bay-berry,
with which the chapel was
illuminated. A couple of nuns
from Montreal made a brief sojourn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">[673]</a></span>
at Norridgewock, that they might
teach the Indian women to sew and
to make a kind of lace with which
to adorn the altar. Busied with his
dictionary and with his flock, Father
Râle thus passed the most
peaceful days of his life; but this
blessed quiet ended only too soon.</p>

<p>In 1705 a party of English, under
the command of a Capt. Hilton,
burst from out the forest, attacking
the little village from all sides
at once, finishing by burning the
chapel and every hut.</p>

<p>About the same time the governor-general
of New England sent
to the lower part of the Kennebec
the ablest of the Boston divines to
instruct the Indian children. As
Baxter’s (the missionary) salary depended
on his success, he neglected
no means that could attract.</p>

<p>For two months he labored in
vain. His caresses and little gifts
were thrown away; for he made not
one convert.</p>

<p>Father Râle wrote to Baxter that
his neophytes were good Christians,
but far from able in disputes.</p>

<p>This same letter, which was of some
length, challenged the Protestant
clergyman to a discussion. Baxter,
after a long delay, sent a brief reply,
in Latin so bad that the learned
priest says it was impossible to understand
it.</p>

<p>In 1717 the Indian chiefs held a
council. The governor of New
England offered them an English
and an Indian Bible, and Mr. Baxter
as their expounder.</p>

<p>The Abnakis refused them one
and all, and elected to adhere to
their Catholic faith, saying: “All
people love their own priests!
Your Bibles we do not care for, and
God has already sent us teachers.”</p>

<p>Thus years passed on in monotonous
labor. The only relaxation
permitted to himself by Father Râle
was the work on his dictionary.
The converts venerated their priest;
their keen eyes and quick instincts
saw the sincerity of his life, the
reality of his affection for them,
and recognized his self-denial and
generosity. They went to him
with their cares and their sorrows,
with their simple griefs and simpler
pleasures. He listened with unaffected
sympathy and interest. No
envious rival, no jealous competitor,
no heretical teacher, disturbed
the relations between pastor and
flock. So, too, was it but natural
that they should look to him for
advice when they gathered about
their council-fires.</p>

<p>The wrongs which the Eastern
Indians were constantly enduring
at the hands of the English settlers
kindled to a living flame the smouldering
hatred in their hearts, which
they sought every opportunity of
wreaking in vengeance on their
foe. Thus, like lightning on the
edge of the horizon, they hovered
on the frontier, making daring
forays on the farms of the settlers.</p>

<p>It was not unnatural that the
English, bristling with prejudices
against the French, and still more
against Catholics, should have seen
fit to look on Father Râle as the
instigator of all these attacks, forgetting&mdash;what
is undeniably true&mdash;that
Father Râle’s converts were
milder and kinder and more Christian-like
than any of their Indian
neighbors. The good father was
full of concern when he heard that
a fierce and warlike tribe, who had
steadily resisted all elevating influences,
were about settling within a
day’s journey of Norridgewock.
He feared lest his children should
be led away by pernicious examples;
so he with difficulty persuaded
some of the strangers to enter
the chapel, and to be present at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">[674]</a></span>
some of the imposing ceremonies
of the mother church. At the
close of the service he addressed
them in simple words, and thus concluded:</p>

<p>“Let us not separate, that some
may go one way and some another.
Let us all go to heaven. It is our
country, and the place to which
we are invited by the sole Master
of life, of whom I am but the interpreter.”
The reply of the Indians
was evasive; but it was evident
that an impression was made,
and in the autumn they sent to
him to say that if he would come
to them they would receive his
teachings.</p>

<p>Father Râle gladly went at this
bidding, erected a cross and a
chapel, and finally baptized nearly
the whole tribe.</p>

<p>At this time Father Râle wrote
to his nephew a letter, in which he
says: “My new church is neat, and
its elegantly-ornamented vestments,
chasubles, copes, and holy vessels
would be esteemed highly appropriate
in almost any church in Europe.
A choir of young Indians,
forty in number, assist at the Holy
Sacrifice of the Mass, and chant the
divine Offices for the consecration
of the Holy Sacrament; and you
would be edified by the beautiful
order they preserve and the devotion
they manifest. After the Mass
I teach the young children, and the
remainder of the morning is devoted
to seeing those who come to consult
me on affairs of importance.
Thus, you see, I teach some, console
others, seek to re-establish peace in
families at variance, and to calm
troubled consciences.”</p>

<p>Another letter still later, in speaking
of the attachment of the converts
to their faith, says: “And
when they go to the sea-shore in
summer to fish, I accompany them;
and when they reach the place
where they intend to pass the night,
they erect stakes at intervals in the
form of a chapel, and spread a tent
made of ticking. All is complete
in fifteen minutes. I always carry
with me a beautiful board of cedar,
with the necessary supports. This
serves for an altar, and I ornament
the interior with silken hangings.
A huge bear-skin serves as a carpet,
and divine service is held within an
hour.”</p>

<p>While away on one of the excursions
which Father Râle thus describes,
the village was attacked by
the English; and again, in 1722, by
a party of two hundred under Col.
Westbrook. New England had
passed a law imposing imprisonment
for life on Catholic priests, and a
reward was offered for the head of
Father Râle. The party was seen,
as they entered the valley of the
Kennebec, by two braves, who hurried
on to give the alarm; the
priest having barely time to escape
to the woods with the altar vessels
and vestments, leaving behind him
all his papers and his precious Abnaki
dictionary, which was enclosed
in a strong box of peculiar construction.
It had two rude pictures on
the lid, one of the scourging of our
Blessed Lord, and the other of the
Crowning of Thorns. This box is
now in the possession of the Massachusetts
Historical Society, while
the dictionary itself is at Harvard.</p>

<p>Father Râle saved himself by
taking refuge in a hollow tree,
where he remained for thirty-six
hours, suffering from hunger and a
broken leg.</p>

<p>With wonderful courage Father
Râle built up another chapel, and
writes thus, after recounting the
efforts of the English to take him
prisoner: “In the words of the
apostle, I conclude: I do not fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">[675]</a></span>
the threats of those who hate me
without a cause, and I count not
my life dear unto myself, so that I
might finish my course and the
ministry which I have received of
the Lord Jesus.”</p>

<p>Again, over the council-fires, the
Indian chiefs assembled. They
decided to send an embassy to Boston,
to demand that their chapel,
which had been destroyed by the
English, should be rebuilt.</p>

<p>The governor, anxious to secure
the alliance of the tribe, listened
patiently, and told them in reply
that it belonged properly to the
governor of Canada to rebuild their
church; still, that he would do it,
provided they would agree to receive
the clergy he would choose,
and would send back to Quebec
the French priest who was then
with them. We cannot forbear repeating
here the unequalled satire
of the Indian’s reply:</p>

<p>“When you came here,” answered
the chief, “we were unknown to
the French governor, but no one
of you spoke of prayer or of the
Great Spirit. You thought only
of my skins and furs. But one day
I met a French black-coat in the
forest. He did not look at the
skins with which I was loaded, but
he said words to me of the Great
Spirit, of Paradise and of hell,
and of prayer, by which is the only
path to heaven.</p>

<p>“I listened with pleasure, and at
last begged him to teach and to
baptize me.</p>

<p>“If, when you saw me, you had
spoken to me of prayer, I should
have had the misfortune to pray as
you do; for I was not then able to
know if your prayers were good.
So, I tell you, I will hold fast to
the prayers of the French. I will
keep them until the earth burn up
and perish.”</p>

<p>At last the final and fatal effort
on the life of Father Râle was
made, in 1724.</p>

<p>All was quiet in the little village.
The tall corn lay yellow in the
slanting rays of an August sun,
when suddenly from the adjacent
woods burst forth a band of English
with their Mohawk allies. The
devoted priest, knowing that they
were in hot pursuit of him, sallied
forth to meet them, hoping, by the
sacrifice of his own life, to save his
flock. Hardly had he reached the
mission cross in the centre of the
village than he fell at its foot,
pierced by a dozen bullets. Seven
Indians, who had sought to shield
him with their bodies, lay dead beside
him.</p>

<p>Then followed a scene that beggars
description. Women and children
were killed indiscriminately;
and it ill became those who shot
women as they swam across the
river to bring a charge of cruelty
against the French fathers.</p>

<p>The chapel was robbed and then
fired; the bell was not melted, but
was probably afterward buried by
the Indians, for it was revealed
only a few years since by the blowing
down of a huge oak-tree, and
was presented to Bowdoin College.</p>

<p>The soft, dewy night closed on
the scene of devastation, and in
the morning, as one by one the survivors
crept back to their ruined
homes with their hearts full of consternation
and sorrow, they found
the body of their beloved priest,
not only pierced by a hundred
balls, but with the skull crushed by
hatchets, arms and legs broken,
and mouth and eyes filled with dirt.
They buried him where the day
before had stood the altar of the
little chapel, and sent his tattered
habits to Quebec.</p>

<p>It was by so precious a death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">[676]</a></span>
that this apostolical man closed a
career of nearly forty years of painful
missionary toil. His fasts and
vigils had greatly enfeebled his constitution,
and, when entreated to
take precautions for his safety, he
answered: “My measures are taken.
God has committed this flock to
my charge, and I will share their
fate, being too happy if permitted
to sacrifice myself for them.”</p>

<p>Well did his superior in Canada,
M. de Bellemont, reply, when requested
to offer Masses for his
soul: “In the words of S. Augustine,
I say it would be wronging a
martyr to pray for him.”</p>

<p>There can be no question that
Sebastian Râle was one of the most
remarkable men of his day. A
devoted Christian and finished
scholar, commanding in manners
and elegant in address, of persuasive
eloquence and great administrative
ability, he courted death
and starvation, for the sole end of
salvation for the Indian.</p>

<p>From the death of Father Râle
until 1730 the mission at Norridgewock
was without a priest. In
that year, however, the superior at
Quebec sent Father James de
Sirenne to that station. The account
given by this father, of the
warmth with which he was received,
and of the manner in which the
Indians had sought to keep their
faith, is very touching. The women
with tears and sobs hastened with
their unbaptized babes to the
priest.</p>

<p>In all these years no Protestant
clergyman had visited them, for
Eliot was almost the only one who
devoted himself to the conversion
of the Indians, though even he, as
affirmed by Bancroft, had never
approached the Indian tribe that
dwelt within six miles of Boston
Harbor until five years after the
cross had been borne, by the religious
zeal of the French, from
Lake Superior to the valley of the
Mississippi.</p>

<p>But Father Sirenne could not
be permitted to remain any length
of time with the Abnakis. Again
were they deserted, having a priest
with them only at long intervals.</p>

<p>Then came the peace of 1763, in
which France surrendered Canada.
This step struck a most terrible
blow at the missions; for although
the English government guaranteed
to the Canadians absolute religious
freedom, they yet took quiet steps
to rid themselves of the Jesuit
Fathers.</p>

<p>A short breathing space, and another
war swept over the land, and
with this perished the last mission
in Maine. In 1775 deputies from
the various tribes in Maine and
Nova Scotia met the Massachusetts
council. The Indians announced
their intention of adhering to the
Americans, but begged, at the same
time, for a French priest. The
council expressed their regret at not
being able to find one.</p>

<p>“Strange indeed was it,” says
Shea, “that the very body which,
less than a century before, had
made it felony for a Catholic priest
to visit the Abnakis, now regretted
their inability to send these Christian
Indians a missionary of the
same faith and nation.”</p>

<p>Years after, when peace was declared,
and the few Catholics in
Maryland had chosen the Rev.
John Carroll&mdash;a member of the proscribed
Society of Jesus&mdash;as bishop,
the Abnakis of Maine sent a deputation
bearing the crucifix of Father
Râle. This they presented to the
bishop, with earnest supplications
for a priest.</p>

<p>Bishop Carroll promised that one
should be sent, and Father Ciquard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">[677]</a></span>
was speedily despatched to Norridgewock,
where he remained for
ten years. Then ensued another
interval during which the flock was
without a shepherd.</p>

<p>At last a missionary priest at Boston,
Father (afterward Cardinal)
Cheverus, turned his attention to
the study of the Abnaki dialect, and
then visited the Penobscot tribe.</p>

<p>Desolate, poor, and forsaken as
they had been, the Indians still
clung to their faith. The old
taught the young, and all gathered
on Sundays to chant the music of
the Mass and Vespers, though their
altar had no priest and no sacrifice.</p>

<p>Father Cheverus, after a few
months, was succeeded by Father
Romagné, who for twenty years
consecrated every moment and
every thought to the evangelization
of the Penobscot and Passamaquoddy
tribes. In July, 1827,
Bishop Fenwick visited this portion
of his diocese, and in 1831
sent them a resident missionary.
A beautiful church stood at last in
the place of Romagné’s hut, and
two years later Bishop Fenwick,
once a father in the Society of
Jesus, erected a monument to Father
Râle on the spot where he
was slain a hundred and nine years
before. From far and near gathered
the crowd, Protestant as well as
Catholic, to witness the ceremony.
The monument stands in a green,
secluded spot, a simple shaft of
granite surmounted by a cross, and
an inscription in Latin tells the
traveller that there died a faithful
priest and servant of the Lord.
Bishop Fenwick became extremely
anxious to induce some French
priest to go to that ancient mission,
and a year later the Society of Picpus,
in Switzerland, sent out Fathers
Demilier and Petithomme to restore
the Franciscan missions in
Maine. They conquered the difficulties
of the Abnaki dialect with
the aid of a prayer-book which the
bishop had caused to be printed,
and in this small and insignificant
mission Father Demilier toiled until
his death, in 1843.</p>

<p>The successor of Bishop Fenwick
resolved to restore the Abnaki
mission to the Fathers of the
Society of Jesus, by whom it had
been originally founded. Therefore,
since 1848, the Penobscots and
Passamaquoddys have been under
the care of the Jesuits, who in that
year sent out from Switzerland Father
John Bapst to Old Town, on
the Penobscot&mdash;a short distance
from Bangor&mdash;where he ministered
faithfully to the Abnakis until he
nearly lost his life in a disgraceful
Know-Nothing riot in 1854.</p>

<p>As we find ourselves thus at the
conclusion of our narration, incidents
crowd upon our memory of
the wondrous sacrifices made by the
Catholic clergy in the old missions
of Maine; but we are admonished
that our space is limited.</p>

<p>Little attention, however, has been
paid to the fact that to these Catholic
priests alone under God is due
the evangelization of the many Indian
tribes which formerly haunted
our grand old forests. Of these
tribes, only a few of the Penobscots
are left, and these cling
still to the cross as the blessed
symbol of the faith first brought to
them, “as a voice crying in the
wilderness,” by Fathers Biard and
Du Thet at St. Sauveur in 1613.</p>

<h3>PRUSSIA AND THE CHURCH.</h3>

<p>The first attempts to introduce
the Christian religion into Prussia
were unsuccessful. S. Adalbert, in
997, and S. Bruno, in 1009, suffered
martyrdom whilst preaching the
Gospel there, and the efforts of Poland
to force the conquered Prussians
to receive the faith only increased
the bitterness of their anti-Christian
prejudices. Early in the
XIIth century Bishop Otto, of Bamberg,
made many conversions in
Pomerania; and finally, in the beginning
of the XIIIth, the Cistercian
monk Christian, with the approval
and encouragement of Pope Innocent
III., set to work to convert the
Prussians, and met with such success
that in 1215 he was made bishop
of the country. The greater
part of the people, however, still
remained heathens, and the progress
of Christianity aroused in
them such indignation that they
determined to oppose its farther
advance with the sword. To
protect his flock Bishop Christian
called to his aid the knights of the
Teutonic Order; in furtherance
of his designs, the Emperor Frederic
II. turned the whole country
over to them, and Pope Gregory
IX. took measures to increase their
number, so that they might be able
to hold possession of this field, now
first opened to the Gospel. Pope
Innocent IV. also manifested special
interest in the welfare of the
church in Prussia; he urged priests
and monks to devote themselves
to this mission, supported and encouraged
the bishops in their trials
and difficulties, and exhorted the
convents throughout Germany to
contribute books for the education
of the people. But circumstances
were not wanting which made the
position of the church in Prussia
very unsatisfactory. The people
had for the most part been brought
under the church’s influence by the
power of arms, and consequently
to a great extent remained strangers
to her true spirit. The Teutonic
Order, moreover, gave ecclesiastical
positions only to German priests, so
as to hold out inducements to the
people to learn German; though, as
a consequence, the priests were unable
to communicate with their
flocks, except by the aid of interpreters.</p>

<p>The grand master, too, had almost
unlimited control over the election
of bishops, which was the cause of
many evils, especially as the Order
gradually grew lax in the observance
of the rule, and lost much of its
Christian character. Unworthy
men were thrust into ecclesiastical
offices, the standard of morality
among the clergy was lowered, and
the people lost respect for the priesthood.
It is not surprising, in view
of all this, that the religious sectaries
of the XIIIth and XIVth centuries
should have found favor in
Prussia, and made converts among
her still half-pagan populations.</p>

<p>In 1466 the Teutonic Order became
a dependency of the crown
of Poland. There was no hope of
its freeing itself from this humiliating
subjection without foreign aid;
and with a view to obtain this, the
knights resolved to choose their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">[679]</a></span>
grand master from one or other of
the most powerful German families.
First, in 1498, they elected Frederic,
Duke of Saxony; and upon
his death, in 1510, Albrecht, Margrave
of Brandenburg, was chosen
to succeed him.</p>

<p>Albrecht refused the oath of supremacy
to Sigismund, King of
Poland, who thereupon, in 1519, declared
war upon him.</p>

<p>To meet the expenses of the war,
Albrecht had the sacred vessels of
the church melted down and minted;
but he was unable to stand
against the arms of Poland, and
therefore sought the mediation of
the Emperor of Germany, through
whose good offices he was able to
conclude, in 1521, a four years’
truce. He now went into Germany,
where Luther was already
preaching the Protestant rebellion,
and asked aid from the Imperial
Parliament, which was holding its
sessions at Nuremberg; and as this
was denied him, he turned with favor
to the teachers of the new doctrines.
The Teutonic Order had
become thoroughly corrupt, and
Leo X. urged Albrecht to begin a
reformation <i lang="la">in capite et membris</i>;
but the grand master sought the
advice of Luther, from whom he
received the not unwelcome counsel
to throw away the “stupid, unnatural
rule of his Order, take a
wife, and turn Prussia into a temporal
hereditary principality.” Albrecht
accordingly asked for preachers
of the new doctrines, and in
1526 announced his abandonment of
the Order and the Catholic Church
by his marriage with the daughter
of the King of Denmark. Acting
upon the Protestant principle, <i lang="la">cujus
regio illius religio</i>&mdash;the ruler of the
land makes its religion&mdash;he forced
the Prussians to quit the church
from which they had received whatever
culture and civilization they
had.</p>

<p>At his death, in 1568, Lutheranism
had gained complete possession of
the country.</p>

<p>A few Catholics, however, remained,
for whom, early in the XVIIth
century, King Sigismund of Poland
succeeded in obtaining liberty
of conscience, which, however, was
denied to those of Brandenburg
Frederic William, the second
king of Prussia, and the first to
form the design of placing her
among the great powers of Europe
by the aid of a strong military
organization, in giving directions
in 1718 for the education of his
son, afterwards Frederic the Great,
insisted that the boy should be inspired
with a horror of the Catholic
Church, “the groundlessness and
absurdity of whose teachings should
be placed before his eyes and well
impressed upon his mind.”</p>

<p>Frederic William was a rigid
Calvinist; and if he tolerated a few
Catholics in his dominions, it was
only that he might vent his ill-humor
or exercise his proselytizing
zeal upon them. He indeed granted
Father Raymundus Bruns permission
to say Mass in the garrisons
at Berlin and Potsdam, but
only after he had been assured that
it would tend to prevent desertions
among his Catholic soldiers, and
that, as Raymundus was a monk,
bound by a vow of poverty, he
would ask no pay from his majesty.</p>

<p>In 1746 permission was granted
the Catholics to hold public worship
in Berlin, and the S. Hedwig’s
church was built; in Pomerania,
however, this privilege was denied
them, except in the Polish districts.</p>

<p>During the XVIIIth century
congregations were formed at Stettin
and Stralsund. In the principality
of Halberstadt the Catholics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">[680]</a></span>
were allowed to retain possession
of a church and several monasteries,
in which public worship was permitted;
and in what had been
the archbishopric of Magdeburg
there were left to them one Benedictine
monastery and four convents
of Cistercian Nuns. These latter,
however, were placed under the
supervision of Protestant ministers.</p>

<p>Frederic the Great early in life
fell under the influence of Voltaire
and his disciples, from whom he
learned to despise all religion, and
especially the rigid Calvinism of
his father. He became a religious
sceptic, and, satisfied with his contempt
for all forms of faith, did
not take the trouble to persecute
any. He asked of his subjects,
whether Protestant or Catholic, nothing
but money and recruits; for
the rest, he allowed every one in
his dominions “to save his soul after
his own fashion.” He provided
chaplains for his Catholic soldiers,
and forbade the Calvinist and Lutheran
ministers to interfere with
their religious freedom, for reasons
similar to those which had induced
his father to permit Raymundus
Bruns to say Mass in the
garrison at Berlin. He had certainly
no thought of showing any
favor to the church, except so far
as it might promote his own ambitious
projects. His great need of
soldiers made him throw every obstacle
in the way of those who
wished to enter the priesthood, and
his fear of foreign influence caused
him to forbid priests to leave the
country. His mistrust of priests
was so great that he gave instructions
to Count Hoym, his Minister
of State, to place them under a system
of espionage. Catholics were
carefully excluded from all influential
and lucrative positions. They
were taxed more heavily than Protestants,
and professors in the universities
were required to take an
oath to uphold the Reformation.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, it was in the
reign of Frederic the Great that
the Catholic Church in Prussia may
be said to have entered upon a new
life. For more than two hundred
years it had had no recognized
status there; but through the conquest
of Silesia and the division
of Poland, a large Catholic population
was incorporated into the kingdom
of Prussia, and thus a new element,
which was formally recognized
in the constitution promulgated
by Frederic’s immediate successor,
was introduced into the
Prussian state. Together with the
toleration of all who believed in
God and were loyal to the king,
the law of the land placed the
Catholic and Protestant churches
on an equal footing. To understand
how far this was favorable to
the church we must go back and
consider the relations of Prussia to
Protestantism.</p>

<p>What is known as the Territorial
System, by which the faith of the
people is delivered into the hands
of the temporal ruler, has existed
in Prussia from the time Albrecht of
Brandenburg went over to the Reformers.
Protestantism and absolutism
triumphed simultaneously
throughout Europe, and this must
undoubtedly be in a great measure
attributed to the fact that the Protestants,
whether willingly or not,
yielded up their faith into the keeping
of kings and princes, and thus
practically abandoned the distinction
of the spiritual and temporal
powers which lies at the foundation
of Christian civilization, and is also
the strongest bulwark against the
encroachments of governments upon
the rights of citizens. Duke
Albrecht had hardly become a Protestant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">[681]</a></span>
when he felt that it was his
duty (“<i lang="la">coacti sumus</i>” are his words)
to take upon himself the episcopal
office. This was in 1530; in 1550
he treated the urgent request of
the Assembly to have the bishopric
of Samland restored as an attack
upon his princely prerogative.</p>

<p>His successor diverted to other
uses the fund destined for the
maintenance of the bishops, and
instituted two consistories, to which
he entrusted the ecclesiastical affairs
of the duchy.</p>

<p>During the XVIIth century
Calvinism gained a firm foothold
in Prussia. It became the religion
of the ruling family, and Frederic
William, called the Great Elector,
to whose policy his successors
have agreed to ascribe their greatness,
sought in every way to promote
its interests, though he strenuously
exercised his <i lang="la">jus episcopale</i>,
his spiritual supremacy over both
the Lutherans and the Calvinists.</p>

<p>His son, Frederic, who first took
the title of King of Prussia (1700),
continued the policy of his father
with regard to ecclesiastical affairs.
“To us alone,” he declared to the
Landstand, “belongs the <i lang="la">jus supremum
episcopale</i>, the highest and
sovereign right in ecclesiastical
matters.”</p>

<p>The Lutherans wished to retain
the exorcism as a part of the ceremony
of baptism; but Frederic
published an edict by which he
forbade the appointment of any
minister who would refuse to confer
the sacrament without making
use of this ceremony. In the
same way he meddled with the
Lutheran practice of auricular confession;
and by an order issued in
1703 prohibited the publication of
theological writings which had not
received his imprimatur.</p>

<p>His successor, Frederic William,
the father of Frederic the Great,
looked upon himself as the absolute
and irresponsible master of the
subjects whom God had given him.
“I am king and master,” he was
wont to say, “and can do what I
please.” He was a rigid Calvinist,
and made his absolutism felt more
especially in religious matters. It
seems that preachers then, as since,
were sometimes in the habit of
preaching long sermons; so King
Frederic William put a fine of two
thalers upon any one who should
preach longer than one hour. He
required his preachers to insist in
<em>all their sermons</em> upon the duty of
obedience and loyalty to the king,
and the government officials were
charged to report any failure to
make special mention of this duty.
Both Lutherans and Calvinists were
forbidden to touch in their sermons
upon any points controverted between
the two confessions. No
detail of religious worship was insignificant
enough to escape his
meddlesome tyranny. The length
of the service, the altar, the vestments
of the minister, the sign of
the cross, the giving or singing the
blessing, all fell under his “high
episcopal supervision.”</p>

<p>This unlovely old king was
followed by Frederic the Great,
who, though an infidel and a scoffer,
held as firmly as his father to his
sovereign episcopal prerogatives,
and who, if less meddlesome, was
not less arbitrary. And now we
have got back to the constitution
which, after Silesia and a part of
Poland had been united to the
crown of Prussia, was partially
drawn up under Frederic the
Great, and completed and promulgated
during the reign of his successor;
and which, as we have
already said, placed the three principal
confessions of the Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">[682]</a></span>
faith in the Prussian states&mdash;viz.,
the Lutheran, the Reformed, and
the Catholic&mdash;on a footing of equality
before the law. Now, it must
be noticed, this constitution left
intact the absolute authority of the
king over the Reformed and Lutheran
churches, and therefore what
might seem to be a great gain for
the Catholic Church was really
none at all, since it was simply
placed under the supreme jurisdiction
of the king. There was no
express recognition of the organic
union of the church in Prussia with
the pope, nor of the right of the
bishops to govern their dioceses
according to the ecclesiastical canons,
but rather the tacit assumption
that the king was head of
the Catholic as of the Protestant
churches in Prussia. The constitution
was drawn up by Suarez, a
bitter enemy of the church, and in
many of its details was characterized
by an anti-Catholic spirit.
It annulled, for instance, the contract
made by parents of different
faith concerning the religious education
of their children, and manifested
in many other ways that
petty and tyrannical spirit which
has led Prussia to interfere habitually
with the internal discipline
and working of the church.</p>

<p>As the Catholic population of
Prussia increased through the annexation
of different German states,
this constitution, which gave the
king supreme control of spiritual
matters, was extended to the newly-acquired
territories. Thus all
through the XVIIIth century the
church in Prussia, though not
openly persecuted, was fettered.
No progress was made, abuses
could not be reformed, the appointment
of bishops was not free, the
training of the priesthood was very
imperfect; and it is not surprising
that this slavery should have been
productive of many and serious
evils.</p>

<p>The French Revolution and the
wars of Napoleon, which caused
social and political upheavals
throughout Europe, toppled down
thrones, overthrew empires, and
broke up and reformed the boundaries
of nations, mark a new epoch
in the history of Prussia, and indeed
of all Germany, whose people
had been taught by these disastrous
wars that they had common interests
which could not be protected
without national unity, the want
of which had never before been
made so painfully manifest.</p>

<p>After the downfall of Napoleon,
the ambassadors of the Allied
Powers met in Vienna to settle the
affairs of all Europe. Nations,
provinces, and cities were given
away in the most reckless manner,
without any thought of the interests
or wishes of the people, to the
kings and rulers who could command
the greatest influence in the
congress or whose displeasure was
most feared. Germany demanded
the restoration of Alsace and
Lorraine, but was thwarted in her
designs by Great Britain and
Russia, who feared the restoration
of her ancient power.</p>

<p>Prussia received from the congress,
as some compensation for its
sufferings and sacrifices during the
Napoleonic wars, the duchies of Jülich
and Berg, the former possessions
of the episcopal sees of Cologne
and Treves, and several other
territories, which were formed into
the Rhine province. On the other
hand, it lost a portion of the Sclavonic
population which it had held
on the east; so that, though it gained
nothing in territory, it became
more strictly a German state, and
was consequently better fitted gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">[683]</a></span>
to take the lead in the irrepressible
movement toward the
unification of Germany.</p>

<p>In the Congress of Vienna it was
stipulated that Catholics and Protestants
should have equal rights
before the law. The constitutional
law of Prussia was extended to the
newly-acquired provinces and “all
ecclesiastical matters, whether of
Roman Catholics or of Protestants,
together with the supervision and
administration of all charitable
funds, the confirming of all persons
appointed to spiritual offices,
and the supervision over the administration
of ecclesiastics as far as it
may have any relation to civil affairs,
were reserved to the government.”</p>

<p>In 1817, upon the occasion of
the reorganization of the government,
we perceive to what practical
purposes these principles were to
be applied. The church was debased
to a function of the state, her
interests were placed in the hands
of the ministry for spiritual affairs,
and the education of even clerical
students was put under the control
of government.</p>

<p>It was in this same year, 1817,
that the tercentennial anniversary
of the birth of Protestantism was
celebrated. For two centuries Protestant
faith in Germany had been
dying out. Eager and bitter controversies,
the religious wars and
the plunder of church property
during the XVIth and early part
of the XVIIth centuries, had given
it an unnatural and artificial vigor.
It was a mighty and radical revolution,
social, political, and religious,
and therefore gave birth to fanaticism
and intense partisan zeal, and
was in turn helped on by them.</p>

<p>There is a natural strength in a
new faith, and when it is tried by
war and persecution it seems to rise
to a divine power. Protestantism
burst upon Europe with irresistible
force. Fifty years had not passed
since Luther had burned the bull
of Pope Leo, and the Catholic
Church, beaten almost everywhere
in the North of Europe, seemed
hardly able to hold her own on the
shores of the Mediterranean; fifty
years later, and Protestantism was
saved in Germany itself only by the
arms of Catholic France. The
peace of Westphalia, in 1648, put an
end to the religious wars of Germany,
and from that date the decay
of the Protestant faith was rapid.
Many causes helped on the work
of ruin; the inherent weakness of
the Protestant system from its purely
negative character, the growing
and bitter dissensions among Protestants,
the hopeless slavery to
which the sects had been reduced
by the civil power, all tended to undermine
faith. In the Palatinate,
within a period of sixty years, the
rulers had forced the people to
change their religion four times.
In Prussia, whose king, as we have
seen, was supreme head of the
church, the ruling house till 1539
was Catholic; then, till 1613, Lutheran;
from that date to 1740, Calvinistic;
from 1740 to 1786, infidel,
the avowed ally of Voltaire and
D’Alembert; then, till 1817, Calvinistic;
and finally again evangelical.</p>

<p>During the long reign of Frederic
the Great unbelief made steady
progress. Men no longer attacked
this or that article of faith, but
Christianity itself. The quickest
way, it was openly said by many, to
get rid of superstition and priest-craft,
would be to abolish preaching
altogether, and thus remove the
ghost of religion from the eyes of
the people. It seems strange that
such license of thought and expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">[684]</a></span>
should have been tolerated,
and even encouraged, in a country
where religion itself has never
been free; but it is a peculiarity
of the Prussian system of government
that while it hampers and
fetters the church and all religious
organizations, it leaves the widest
liberty of conscience to the individual.
Its policy appears to be to
foster indifference and infidelity, in
order to use them against what it
considers religious fanaticism. Another
circumstance which favored
infidelity may be found in the political
thraldom in which Prussia
held her people. As men were forbidden
to speak or write on subjects
relating to the government
or the public welfare, they took refuge
in theological and philosophical
discussions, which in Protestant
lands have never failed to lead to
unbelief. This same state of things
tended to promote the introduction
and increase of secret societies,
which, in the latter half of the
XVIIIth century, sprang up in
great numbers throughout Germany,
bearing a hundred different
names, but always having anti-Christian
tendencies.</p>

<p>To stop the spread of infidelity,
Frederic William II., the successor
of Frederic the Great, issued, in
1788, an “edict, embracing the
constitution of religion in the
Prussian states.” The king declared
that he could no longer suffer
in his dominions that men
should openly seek to undermine
religion, to make the Bible ridiculous
in the eyes of the people, and
to raise in public the banner of unbelief,
deism, and naturalism. He
would in future permit no farther
change in the creed, whether of the
Lutheran or the Reformed Church.
This was the more necessary as he
had himself noticed with sorrow,
years before he ascended the throne,
that the Protestant ministers allowed
themselves boundless license
with regard to the articles of faith,
and indeed altogether rejected several
essential parts and fundamental
verities of the Protestant Church
and the Christian religion. They
blushed not to revive the long-since-refuted
errors of the Socinians, the
deists, and the naturalists, and to
scatter them among the people under
the false name of enlightenment
(<i lang="de">Aufklärung</i>), whilst they
treated God’s Word with disdain,
and strove to throw suspicion upon
the mysteries of revelation. Since
this was intolerable, he, therefore, as
ruler of the land and only law-giver
in his states, commanded and ordered
that in future no clergyman,
preacher, or school-teacher of the
Protestant religion should presume,
under pain of perpetual loss of office
and of even severer punishment,
to disseminate the errors already
named; for, as it was his
duty to preserve intact the law of
the land, so was it incumbent upon
him to see that religion should be
kept free from taint; and he could
not, consequently, allow its ministers
to substitute their whims and fancies
for the truths of Christianity.
They must teach what had been
agreed upon in the symbols of faith
of the denomination to which they
belonged; to this they were bound
by their office and the contract under
which they had received their
positions. Nevertheless, out of his
great love for freedom of conscience,
the king was willing that those who
were known to disbelieve in the
articles of faith might retain their
offices, provided they consented to
teach their flocks what they were
themselves unable to believe.</p>

<p>In this royal edict we have at
once the fullest confession of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685">[685]</a></span>
general unbelief that was destroying
Protestantism in Prussia, and of the
hopelessness of any attempt to arrest
its progress. What could be
more pitiable than the condition
of a church powerless to control its
ministers, and publicly recognizing
their right to be hypocrites? How
could men who had no faith teach
others to believe? Moreover, what
could be more absurd, from a Protestant
point of view, than to seek
to force the acceptance of symbols
of faith when the whole Reformation
rested upon the assumed right of
the individual to decide for himself
what should or should not be believed?
Or was it to be supposed
that men could invest the conflicting
creeds of the sects with a sacredness
which they had denied to
that of the universal church? It is
not surprising, therefore, that the
only effect of the edict should have
been to increase the energy and activity
of the infidels and free-thinkers.</p>

<p>Frederic William III., who ascended
the throne in 1797, recognizing
the futility of his father’s attempt
to keep alive faith in Protestantism,
stopped the enforcement of
the edict, with the express declaration
that its effect had been to lessen
religion and increase hypocrisy.
Abandoning all hope of controlling
the faith of the preachers, he turned
his attention to their morals. A
decree of the Oberconsistorium of
Berlin, in 1798, ordered that the
conduct of the ministers should
be closely watched and every
means employed to stop the daily-increasing
immorality of the servants
of the church, which was having
the most injurious effects upon
their congregations. Parents had
almost ceased having their children
baptized, or had them christened in
the “name of Frederic the Great,”
or in the “name of the good and
the fair,” sometimes with rose-water.</p>

<p>But the calamities which befell
Germany during the wars of the
French Revolution and the empire
seemed to have turned the thoughts
of many to religion. The frightful
humiliations of the fatherland were
looked upon as a visitation from
heaven upon the people for their
sins and unbelief; and therefore,
when the tercentennial anniversary
of Protestantism came around (in
1817), they were prepared to enter
upon its celebration with earnest
enthusiasm. The celebration took
the form of an anti-Catholic demonstration.
For many years controversy
between Protestants and
Catholics had ceased; but now a
wholly unprovoked but bitter and
grossly insulting attack was made
upon the church from all the Protestant
pulpits of Germany and in
numberless writings. The result
of this wanton aggression was a
reawakening of Catholic faith and
life; whilst the attempt to take advantage
of the Protestant enthusiasm
to bring about a union between
the Lutheran and Reformed
churches in Prussia ended in causing
fresh dissensions and divisions.
The sect of the Old Lutherans was
formed, which, in spite of persecution,
finally succeeded in obtaining
toleration, though not till many of
its adherents had been driven
across the ocean into exile.</p>

<p>As the Congress of Vienna had
decided that Catholics and Protestants
should be placed upon a footing
of equality, and as Prussia had
received a large portion of the <em>secularized</em>
lands of the church, with the
stipulation that she should provide
for the maintenance of Catholic
worship, the government, in 1816,
sent Niebuhr, the historian, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">[686]</a></span>
Rome, to treat with the Pope concerning
the reorganization of the
Catholic religion in the Prussian
states. Finally, in 1821, an agreement
was signed, which received
the sanction of the king, and was
published as a fundamental law
of the state.</p>

<p>In this Concordat with the Holy
See there is at least a tacit recognition
of the true nature of the
church, of her organic unity&mdash;a beginning
of respect for her freedom,
and a seeming promise of a better
future. In point of fact, however,
in spite of Niebuhr’s assurance to
the Holy Father that he might rely
upon the honest intentions of the
government, Prussia began almost
at once to meddle with the rights of
Catholics. A silent and slow persecution
was inaugurated, by which
it was hoped their patience would
be exhausted and their strength
wasted. And now we shall examine
more closely the artful and heartless
policy by which, with but slight variations,
for more than two centuries
Prussia has sought to undermine
the Catholic religion. In 1827 the
Protestants of all communions in
Prussia amounted to 6,370,380, and
the Catholics to 4,023,513. These
populations are, to only a very limited
extent, intermingled; certain
provinces being almost entirely
Catholic, and others nearly wholly
Protestant. By law the same rights
are granted to both Catholics and
Protestants; and both, therefore,
should receive like treatment at the
hands of the government.</p>

<p>This is the theory; what are the
facts? We will take the religious
policy of Prussia from the reorganization
of the church after the
Congress of Vienna down to the
revolution of 1848, and we will begin
with the subject of education.
For the six millions of Protestants
there were four exclusively
Protestant universities, at Berlin,
Halle, Königsberg, and Greifswalde;
for the four millions of Catholics
there were but two <em>half universities</em>,
at Bonn and Breslau, in each of
which there was a double faculty,
the one Protestant, the other Catholic;
though the professors in all the
faculties, except that of theology,
were for the most part Protestants.
Thus, out of six universities, to the
Catholics was left only a little corner
in two, though they were forced
to bear nearly one-half of the public
burdens by which all six were
supported. But this is not the
worst. The bishops had no voice
in the nomination of the professors,
not even those of theology. They
were simply asked whether they had
any objections to make, <em>on proof</em>.
The candidate might be a stranger,
he might be wholly unfitted to teach
theology, he might be free from open
immorality or heresy; and therefore,
because the bishops could <em>prove</em>
nothing against him, he was appointed
to instruct the aspirants to the
priesthood.</p>

<p>At Breslau a foreign professor
was appointed, who began to teach
the most scandalous and heretical
doctrines. Complaints were useless.
During many years his pupils
drank in the poison, and at length,
after he had done his work of destruction,
he was, as in mockery, removed.
Nor is this an isolated
instance of the ruin to Catholic
faith wrought by this system. The
bishops had hardly any influence
over the education of their clergy,
who, young and ignorant of the
world, were thrown almost without
restraint into the pagan corruptions
of a German university, in order to
acquire a knowledge of theology.
At Cologne a Catholic college
was made over to the Protestants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">[687]</a></span>
at Erfurt and Düsseldorf Catholic
<i lang="de">gymnasia</i> were turned into mixed
establishments with all the professors,
save one, Protestants.</p>

<p>Elementary education was under
the control of provincial boards
consisting of a Protestant president
and three councillors, <em>one</em> of whom
might be a Catholic in Catholic
districts. In the Catholic provinces
of the Rhine and Westphalia,
the place of Catholic councillor
was left vacant for several years
till the schools were all reorganized.
Indeed, the real superintendent
of Catholic elementary education
was generally a Protestant
minister.</p>

<p>There was a government <i lang="de">Censur</i>
for books of religious instruction,
the headquarters of which were
in Berlin, but its agents were scattered
throughout all the provinces.
All who were employed in this department,
to which even the pastorals
of the bishops had to be submitted
before being read to their
flocks, were Protestants. The widest
liberty was given to Protestants
to attack the church; but
when the Catholics sought to defend
themselves, their writings were suppressed.
Professor Freudenfeld was
obliged to quit Bonn because he had
spoken of Luther without becoming
respect.</p>

<p>Permission to start religious
journals was denied to Catholics,
but granted to Protestants; and in
the pulpit the priests were put
under strict restraint, while the
preachers were given full liberty
of speech. Whenever a community
of Protestants was found in
a Catholic district, a church, a
clergyman, and a school were immediately
provided for them; indeed,
richer provision for the
Protestant worship was made in
the Catholic provinces than elsewhere;
but when a congregation of
Catholics grew up amongst Protestants,
the government almost invariably
rejected their application
for permission to have a place of
worship. At various times and
places churches and schools were
taken from the Catholics and turned
over to the Protestants; and
though Prussia had received an
enormous amount of the confiscated
property of the church, she did not
provide for the support of the
priests as for that of the ministers.</p>

<p>At court there was not a single
Catholic who held office; the
heads of all the departments of
government were Protestants; the
Post-Office department, down to
the local postmasters, was exclusively
Protestant; all ambassadors
and other representatives of the
government, though sent to Catholic
courts, were Protestants.</p>

<p>In Prussia the state is divided
into provinces, and at the head of
each province is a high-president
(Ober-Präsident). This official, to
whom the religious interests of the
Catholics were committed, was always
a Protestant. The provinces
are divided into districts, and at
the head of each district was a
Protestant president, and almost
all the inferior officers, even in Catholic
provinces, were Protestants.</p>

<p>Again, in the courts of justice
and in the army all the principal
positions were given to Protestants.
In the two <i lang="fr">corps d’armées</i> of Prussia
and Silesia, one-half was Catholic;
in the army division of Posen,
two-thirds; in that of Westphalia
and Cleves, three-fifths; and, finally,
in that of the Rhine, seven-eighths;
yet there was not one Catholic
field-officer, not a general or major.
In 1832 a royal order was issued
to provide for the religious wants
of the army, and every care was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">[688]</a></span>
taken for the spiritual needs of the
Protestant soldiers; but not even
one Catholic chaplain was appointed.
All persons in active service,
from superior officers down to private
soldiers, were declared to be
members of the military parish, and
were placed under the authority
of the Protestant chaplains. If a
Catholic soldier wished to get married
or to have his child baptized
by a priest, he had first to obtain
the permission of his Protestant
curate. What was still more intolerable,
the law regulating military
worship was so contrived as to
force the Catholic soldiers to be
present at Protestant service.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to the relations
of the church in Prussia with the
Holy See. All direct communications
between the Catholics and
the Pope were expressly forbidden.
Whenever the bishops wished to
consult the Holy Father concerning
the administration of their dioceses,
their inquiries had to pass
through the hands of the Protestant
ministry, to be forwarded or
not at its discretion, and the answer
of the Pope had to pass
through the same channel. It was
not safe to write; for the government
had no respect for the mails,
and letters were habitually opened
by order of Von Nagler, the postmaster-general,
who boasted that
he had never had any idiotic scruples
about such matters; that
Prince Constantine was his model,
who had once entertained him with
narrating how he had managed to
get the choicest selection of intercepted
letters in existence; he had
had them bound in morocco, and
they formed thirty-three volumes
of the most interesting reading in
his private library. Thus the
church was ruled by a system of
espionage and bureaucracy which
hesitated not to violate all the
sanctities of life to accomplish its
ends. The bishops were reduced
to a state of abject dependence;
not being allowed to publish any
new regulation or to make any appointment
without the permission
and approval of the Protestant
high-president, from whom they
constantly received the most annoying
and vexatious despatches.</p>

<p>The election of bishops was reduced
to a mere form. When a
see became vacant, the royal commissary
visited the chapter and
announced the person whom the
king had selected to fill the office,
declaring at the same time that no
other would receive his approval.</p>

<p>The minutest details of Catholic
worship were placed under the
supervision and control of Protestant
laymen, who had to decide
how much wine and how many
hosts might be used during the
year in the different churches.</p>

<p>We come now to a matter, vexed
and often discussed, in which the
trials of the church in Prussia,
prior to the recent persecutions,
finally culminated; we allude to
the subject of marriages between
Catholics and Protestants.</p>

<p>When, in 1803, Prussia got possession
of the greater part of her
Catholic provinces, the following
order was at once issued: “His
majesty enacts that children born
in wedlock shall all be educated
in the religion of the father, and
that, in opposition to this law,
neither party shall bind the other.”
Apart from the odious meddling
of the state with the rights of individuals
and the agreements of
parties so closely and sacredly related
as man and wife, there was
in this enactment a special injustice
to Catholics, from the fact that nearly
all the mixed marriages in Prussia
were contracted by Protestant
government officials and Catholic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">[689]</a></span>
women of the provinces to which
these agents had been sent. As
these men held lucrative offices,
they found no difficulty in making
matrimonial alliances; and as the
children had to be brought up in
the religion of the father, the government
was by this means gradually
establishing Protestant congregations
throughout its Catholic provinces.
In 1825 this law was extended
to the Rhenish province, and
in 1831 a document was brought to
light which explained the object of
the extension&mdash;viz., that it might
prove an effectual measure against
the proselyting system of Catholics.</p>

<p>The condition of the church was
indeed deplorable. With the name
of being free, she was, in truth, enslaved;
and while the state professed
to respect her rights, it was using
all the power of the most thoroughly
organized and most heartless
system of bureaucracy and espionage
to weaken and fetter her action,
and even to destroy her life. This
was the state of affairs when, in the
end of 1835, Von Droste Vischering,
one of the greatest and noblest men
of this century, worthy to be named
with Athanasius and with Ambrose,
was made archbishop of Cologne.</p>

<p>The Catholic people of Prussia
had long since lost all faith in the
good intentions of the government,
of whose acts and aims they had full
knowledge; and it was in order to
restore confidence that a man so
trusted and loved by them as Von
Droste Vischering was promoted to
the see of Cologne. The doctrines
of Hermes, professor of theology in
the University of Bonn, had just
been condemned at Rome, but the
government ignored the papal brief,
and continued to give its support
to the Hermesians; the archbishop,
nevertheless, condemned their writings,
and especially their organ, the
<cite>Bonner Theologische Zeitschrift</cite>, forbade
his students to attend their
lectures at the university, and finally
withdrew his approbation altogether
from the Hermesian professors,
refusing to ordain students unless
they formally renounced the
proscribed doctrines.</p>

<p>By a ministerial order issued in
1825, priests were forbidden, under
pain of deposition from office, to
exact in mixed marriages any
promise concerning the education
of the offspring. A like penalty was
threatened for refusing to marry
parties who were unwilling to make
such promises, or for withholding absolution
from those who were bringing
up their children in the Protestant
religion. To avert as far as
possible any conflict between the
church and the government, Pius
VIII., in 1830, addressed a brief to
the bishops of Cologne, Treves,
Münster, and Paderborn, in which
he made every allowable concession
to the authority of the state in the
matter of mixed marriages. The
court of Berlin withheld the papal
brief, and, taking advantage of the
yielding disposition of Archbishop
Spiegel of Cologne, entered, without
the knowledge of the Holy See,
into a secret agreement with him,
in which still farther concessions
were made, and in violation of
Catholic principle. Von Droste
Vischering took as his guide the
papal brief, and paid no attention to
such provisions of the secret agreement
as conflicted with the instructions
of the Holy Father.</p>

<p>The government took alarm, and
offered to let fall the Hermesians, if
the archbishop would yield in the
affair of mixed marriages; and as
this expedient failed, measures of
violence were threatened, which
were soon carried into effect; for
on the evening of the 20th of November,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">[690]</a></span>
1837, the archbishop was secretly
arrested and carried off to
the fortress of Minden, where he
was placed in close confinement, all
communication with him being cut
off. The next morning the government
issued a “Publicandum,” in
which it entered its accusations
against the archbishop, in order to
justify its arbitrary act and to appease
the anger of the people.
Notwithstanding, a cry of indignation
and grief was heard in all the
Catholic provinces of Prussia, which
was re-echoed throughout Germany
and extended to all Europe. Lukewarm
Catholics grew fervent, and
the very Hermesians gathered with
their sympathies to uphold the
cause of the archbishop.</p>

<p>The Archbishop of Posen and the
Bishops of Paderborn and Münster
announced their withdrawal from
the secret convention, which the
Bishop of Treves had already done
upon his death-bed; and henceforward
the priests throughout the
kingdom held firm to the ecclesiastical
law on mixed marriages, so
that in 1838 Frederic William III.
was forced to make a declaration
recognizing the rights for which
they contended. But the Archbishop
of Cologne was still a prisoner
in the fortress of Minden.
Early, however, in 1839, health
began to fail; and as the government
feared lest his death in prison
might produce unfavorable comment,
he received permission to
withdraw to Münster. The next
year the king died, and his successor,
Frederic William IV., showed
himself ready to settle the dispute
amicably, and in other ways to do
justice to the Catholics. A great
victory had been gained&mdash;the secret
convention was destroyed&mdash;a
certain liberty of communication
with the Pope was granted to the
bishops. The election of bishops
was made comparatively free, the
control of the schools of theology
was restored to them, the Hermesians
either submitted or were removed,
and the Catholics of Germany
awoke from a deathlike sleep
to new and vigorous life.</p>

<p>An evidence of the awakening
of faith was given in the fall of
1844, when a million and a half of
German Catholics went in pilgrimage,
with song and prayer, to Treves.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, many grievances remained
unredressed. The <i lang="de">Censur</i>
was still used against the church;
and when the Catholics asked permission
to publish journals in
which they could defend themselves
and their religious interests,
they were told that such publications
were not needed; but when
Ronge, the suspended priest, sought
to found his sect of “German Catholics,”
he received every encouragement
from the government, and the
earnest support of the officials and
nearly the entire press of Prussia;
though, at this very time, every effort
was being made to crush the
“Old Lutherans.”</p>

<p>The government continued to
find pretexts for meddling with the
affairs of the bishops, and the newspapers
attacked the church in the
most insulting manner, going so far
as to demand that the religious exercises
for priests should be placed
under police supervision. We have
now reached a memorable epoch in
the history of the Catholic Church
in Prussia&mdash;the revolution of 1848,
which convulsed Germany to its
centre, spread dismay among all
classes, and filled its cities with riot
and bloodshed. When order was
re-established, the liberties of the
church were recognized more fully
than they had been for three centuries.</p>

<h3>GARCIA MORENO.</h3>

<p class="center">FROM THE CIVILTA CATTOLICA.</p>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p>The atrocious assassination of
Garcia Moreno, the President of
the republic of Ecuador, has filled
the minds of all good people with
the deepest grief and horror. The
liberals are the only ones who have
mentioned it in their journals with
indifference. One of them headed
his announcement of it, “A victim
of the Sacred Heart”&mdash;alluding,
with blasphemous irony, to the act
of consecration of his people to the
Adorable Heart of our Lord which
this truly pious ruler had made.
But with the exception of these
reprobates&mdash;who, hating God, cannot
love mankind&mdash;no one who has
any admiration of moral greatness
can help deploring the death of
this extraordinary man&mdash;a death the
more deplorable on account of its
coming, not from a natural cause,
but from a detestable conspiracy
concocted by the enemies of all
that is good, who abhorred equally
the wisdom of his government and
the soundness of his faith. The
London <cite>Times</cite> has a despatch from
Paris of October 5 with the following
communication: “It appears,
from authentic information which
we have received, that Garcia Moreno,
lately President of the republic
of Ecuador, has been assassinated
by a secret society which extends
through all South America, as well
as Europe. The assassin was selected
by lot, and obtained admission
to the palace at Quito. One
of his accomplices, an official, who
was arrested after the murder, was
assured by the president of the
court-martial, before his trial, that
he would be pardoned if he turned
state’s evidence. ‘Be pardoned?’
said he. ‘That would be of no use
to me; if you pardon me, my comrades
will not. I would rather be
shot than stabbed.’” This decision
of the society to kill him was known
to Moreno, and he informed the
Pope of it in a letter, which we
will shortly give.</p>

<p>This illustrious man had governed
the republic of Ecuador for
about fifteen years&mdash;first as dictator,
and afterwards, for two consecutive
terms, as president; and to
this office he had just been re-elected
for a third term by an
unanimous vote. He had taken
charge of the state when it was in
an exceedingly miserable condition,
and by his lofty genius, practical
tact, and perseverance, but above
all by his piety and confidence in
God, had completely renovated
and restored not only the morals
of the people, but also the whole
political administration, and made
the country a perfect model of a
Christian nation. He was intending
to complete the work which he
had begun, and was able to rely
confidently on the co-operation of
his people, whose reverence and
love for him were unbounded. But
all this was intolerable to the
liberals of our day; they could not
bear that in a corner of the New
World the problem should be
solved, which they are trying to
make so perplexing, of harmony
between the state and the church;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">[692]</a></span>
of the combination of temporal
prosperity and Catholic piety; of
obedience to the civil law and perfect
submission to ecclesiastical authority.
This was an insufferable
scandal for modern liberalism,<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>
especially because such a good
example might do much to frustrate
the plans of this perverse sect
in other countries.</p>

<p>The Masons, therefore, resolved
to murder this man, whom they had
found to be too brave and determined
to be checked in any other
way; for all the attempts they had
made to intimidate him or to diminish
his popularity had been entirely
without effect. Moreno anticipated
the blow, but, far from
fearing it, was only the more persuaded
to persevere in his undertaking,
regarding it as the greatest
happiness to be able to give his life
for so holy a cause. In the last
letter which he wrote to the Supreme
Pontiff before his assassination
are these words: “I implore
your apostolic benediction, Most
Holy Father, having been re-elected
(though I did not deserve it) to
the office of president of this Catholic
republic for another six years.
Although the new term does not
begin till the 30th of August, the
day on which I take the oath required
by the constitution, so that
then only shall I need to give your
Holiness an official notification of
my re-election, nevertheless I wish
not to delay in informing you of it,
in order that I may obtain from
Heaven the strength and light
which I more than any other one
shall need, to keep me a child of
our Redeemer and loyal and obedient
to his infallible Vicar. And
now that the lodges of neighboring
countries, inspired by Germany,
vomit out against me all sorts of
atrocious insults and horrible calumnies,
and even secretly lay plans
for my assassination, I require
more than ever the divine assistance
and protection to live and die in
defence of our holy religion and of
this beloved republic which God
has given me to govern. How
fortunate I am, Most Holy Father,
to be hated and calumniated for the
sake of our divine Saviour; and
what unspeakable happiness would
it be for me if your benediction
should obtain for me the grace to
shed my blood for him who,
though he was God, yet shed his
own on the cross for us!” This
heroic desire of the fervent Christian
was granted. He was murdered by
the enemies of Christ, in hatred of
his zeal for the restoration of the
Christian state and of his fervent
love for the church. He is truly a
martyr of Christ. Are not S. Wenceslaus
of Bohemia and S. Canute
of Denmark numbered among the
holy martyrs, for the same cause?
Both of them were killed in the
precincts of the temple of God;
and Moreno was carried back to
the church from which he had only
just departed, to breathe out his
noble soul into the bosom of his
Creator.</p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p>The object of Masonic civilization
is society without God. The results
which it has succeeded in
achieving, and which it deems of
such importance, are the separation
of the state from the church, liberty
of worship, the withdrawal of public
charities from religious objects, the
exclusion of the clergy from the
work of education, the suppression
of religious orders, the supremacy
of the civil law, and the setting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693">[693]</a></span>
aside of the law of the Gospel.
Only by these means, according to
the Masons, can the happiness of
the people, the prosperity of the
state, and the increase of morality
and learning be attained. These
are their fundamental maxims.
Now, the difficulty was that Moreno
had practically shown, and was
continuing to show more completely
every day, that the peace, prosperity,
and greatness of a nation will
be in proportion to its devotion to
God and its obedience to the
church; that subjection to God
and his church, far from diminishing,
ensures and increases, the true
liberty of man; that the influence
of the clergy promotes not only the
cause of morality, but also that of
letters and science; that man’s
temporal interests are never better
cared for than when they are subordinated
to those which are eternal;
and that love of country is
never so powerful as when it is
consecrated by love of the church.</p>

<p>A man of the most distinguished
talents, which had been most fully
cultivated at the University of
Paris, Moreno had in his own
country occupied the most conspicuous
positions. He had been
a professor of the natural sciences,
rector of the university, representative,
senator, commander-in-chief
of the army, dictator, and president
of the republic. In this last
office, in which he would probably
have been retained by the nation
through life, he showed what genius
sanctified by religion can accomplish.
His first care was to establish
peace throughout the country,
without which there can be no
civil progress; and he succeeded
in doing so, not by compromises,
as is now the fashion&mdash;not by making
a monstrous and abnormal
amalgamation of parties and principles&mdash;but
by the consistent and
firm assertion of the principles of
morality and justice, and by the
open and unhesitating profession
of Catholicity. His success was
so marked that Ecuador very soon
arrived at such a perfect state of
tranquillity and concord as to seem
a prodigy among the agitated and
turbulent republics in its neighborhood.</p>

<p>With the exception of some local
and ineffectual attempts at revolution
during his first presidency,
which were quelled by placing
some of the southern provinces in
a state of siege for fifty days, Ecuador
was undisturbed by sedition
during the whole of his long government.
This was partly due to
the splendor of his private and
public virtues, which dissipated the
clouds of envy and hatred, and
gained for him the esteem even of
his political opponents. He was
chaste, magnanimous, just, impartial,
and so well known for clearheadedness
that the people often
stopped him on the streets to decide
their disputes on the spot, and
accepted his opinion as final. His
disinterestedness seems fabulous
when we think of the immoderate
cupidity prevailing among modern
politicians. In his first six years
he would not even draw his salary,
being content to live on the income
of his own moderate fortune. In
his second term he accepted it, but
spent it almost entirely in works of
public utility. And in such works
he employed the whole of his time.
When any one endeavored to persuade
him not to shorten his life
by such continual labor, he used to
say: “If God wants me to rest, he
will send me illness or death.”</p>

<p>Owing to this unwearying assiduity
and his ardent love for the
good of his people, he was able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_694" id="Page_694">[694]</a></span>
undertake and finish an amount of
business that would appear incredible,
were not the evidence too
strong to admit of doubt. In No.
1,875 of the <cite>Univers</cite> there is a catalogue
of the principal enterprises
which he carried through in a brief
period. They are as follows:</p>

<p>A revision of the constitution.</p>

<p>The paying of the customs to
the national treasury, instead of to
the provincial ones, as formerly.</p>

<p>National representation for the
country as well as the cities.</p>

<p>The establishment of a fiscal
court, and the organization of the
courts of justice.</p>

<p>The foundation of a great polytechnic
school, which was partially
entrusted to the Jesuits.</p>

<p>The construction and equipment
of an astronomical observatory,
which was built and directed by
the Jesuits. On account of the
equatorial position of Quito, Garcia
Moreno, who was well versed in
the mathematical sciences, wished
to make this observatory equal to
any in the world. He bought most
of the instruments with his own
private funds.</p>

<p>Roads connecting different parts
of the country. Garcia Moreno
laid out and nearly completed five
great national roads. The principal
one, that from Guayaquil to Quito,
is eighty leagues in length. It is
paved, and has one hundred and
twenty bridges. It is a solid and
stupendous work, constructed in
the face of almost insuperable difficulties.</p>

<p>The establishment of four new
dioceses.</p>

<p>A concordat with the Holy See.</p>

<p>The reformation of the regular
clergy; the restoration among them
of a common and monastic life.</p>

<p>The reconstruction of the army.
The army had been a mere horde,
without organization, discipline, or
uniform; the men hardly had shoes.
Moreno organized them on the
French system, clothed, shod, and
disciplined them; now they are
the model as well as the defence
of the people.</p>

<p>The building of a light-house at
Guayaquil. Previously there had
been none on the whole coast.</p>

<p>Reforms in the collection of the
customs. Frauds put an end to,
and the revenues trebled.</p>

<p>Colleges in all the cities; schools
in even the smallest villages&mdash;all
conducted by the Christian Brothers.</p>

<p>Schools for girls; Sisters of Charity,
Ladies of the Sacred Heart,
Sisters of the Good Shepherd, of
Providence, and Little Sisters of
the Poor.</p>

<p>Public hospitals. During his first
presidency Moreno turned out the
director of the hospital at Quito,
who had refused to receive a poor
man and was very negligent of his
duties, and made himself director
in his stead. He visited the hospital
every day, improved its arrangements,
and put it in good working
order. He performed in it many
acts of heroic charity.</p>

<p>The maintenance and increase
of lay congregations and orders.
He was an active member of the
Congregation of the Poor.</p>

<p>The establishment of four museums.</p>

<p>The Catholic Protectory, a vast
and magnificent school of arts and
trades, on the plan of S. Michele
at Rome, and conducted by the
Christian Brothers.</p>

<p>Postal conventions with various
foreign states.</p>

<p>The embellishment and restoration
of the cities. Guayaquil, and
especially Quito, seemed as if they
had been rebuilt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695">[695]</a></span></p>

<p>And he accomplished all this,
not only without increasing the
taxes, but even diminishing some
of them. This is the reason why
he was so much beloved by the
people; why they called him father
of his country and saviour of the
republic. But it was also this
which was his unpardonable sin,
which had to promptly receive a
chastisement which should serve as
a warning for his successors, that
they might not dare to imitate his
manner of government. For such
a course as his was sure to ruin the
credit of Masonry in the popular
mind.</p>

<h4>III.</h4>

<p>Moreno loved his country, and
worked so hard for its good, because
he was truly and thoroughly
religious. Every one who really
loves God loves his neighbor also;
and he who loves God intensely
loves his neighbor in the same way,
because he sees in him the image
of God and the price of his blood.</p>

<p>When he was a student in Paris
he was admired for his piety. In
his own country, amid the continual
cares and heavy responsibilities
of his office, he always found time
to hear Mass every morning and
say the rosary every night. In his
familiar conversation he spoke frequently
of God, of religion, of virtue,
and with such fervor that all
who heard felt their hearts touched
and moved by his words. Before
beginning the business of the day,
he always made a visit to the church
to implore light from the Source
of all wisdom; and he had just left
it, as we have said, when he met the
ambuscade which was prepared for
him. This religious spirit produced
in him a great zeal for the glory
of God, and that devotion to the
Vicar of Christ which in him so
much resembled the affection of a
child for his father. Let it suffice
to say that when he had to arrange
the concordat with the Holy See,
he sent his ambassador to Rome
with a blank sheet signed by himself,
telling him to ask his Holiness
to write on it whatever seemed to
him right and conducive to the
good of the church and the true
welfare of the nation. Such was
the confidence which he reposed in
the Pope, with whom politicians
are accustomed to treat as if he
were an ambitious and designing
foreign prince, instead of being the
father of all the faithful. When the
revolution entered Rome in triumph
through the breach of Porta Pia,
Garcia Moreno was the only ruler
in the world who dared to enter a
solemn protest against that sacrilegious
invasion; and he obtained
from his Congress a considerable
sum as a monthly subsidy and tribute
of affection to his Holiness.</p>

<p>But his piety toward God and
his filial love to the church can
best be seen from the message to
Congress which he finished a few
hours before his death, and which
was found on his dead body, steeped
in his blood. Although it is
somewhat long for the limits of an
article, we think that we ought to
present it to our readers as an imperishable
monument of true piety
and enlightened policy, and as a
lesson for the false politicians of
the present day and of days to
come.</p>

<p>The message is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Senators and Deputies</span>: I
count among the greatest of the
great blessings which God has, in
the inexhaustible abundance of his
mercy, granted to our republic, that
of seeing you here assembled under
his protection, in the shadow of his
peace, which he has granted and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696">[696]</a></span>
still grants to us, while we are
nothing and can do nothing, and
only give in return for his paternal
goodness inexcusable and shameful
ingratitude.</p>

<p>“It is only a few years since
Ecuador had to repeat daily these
sad words which the liberator Bolivar
addressed in his last message to
the Congress of 1830: ‘I blush to
have to acknowledge that independence
is the only good which we
have acquired, and that we have
lost all the rest in acquiring it.’</p>

<p>“But since the time when, placing
all our hope in God, we escaped
from the torrent of impiety and
apostasy which overwhelms the
world in this age of blindness;
since 1869, when we reformed ourselves
into a truly Catholic nation,
everything has been on a course of
steady and daily improvement, and
the prosperity of our dear country
has been continually increasing.</p>

<p>“Ecuador was not long ago a
body from which the life-blood was
ebbing, and which was even, like
a corpse, already a prey to a horrible
swarm of vermin which the liberty
of putrefaction engendered in
the darkness of the tomb. But
to-day, at the command of that sovereign
voice which called Lazarus
from the sepulchre, it has returned
to life, though it still has not entirely
cast off the winding-sheet and
bandages&mdash;that is to say, the remains
and effects of the misery and corruption
in which it had been buried.</p>

<p>“To justify what I have said, it
will suffice for me to give a short
sketch of the progress which has
been made in these last two years,
referring you to the various departments
of the government for documentary
and detailed information.
And that you may see exactly how
far we have advanced in this period
of regeneration, I shall compare
our present condition with that
from which we started; not for our
own glory and self-gratulation, but
to glorify Him to whom we owe
everything, and whom we adore as
our Redeemer and our Father, our
Protector and our God.”</p>

</div>

<p>Here follows an enumeration of
all the improvements which had
been made. He continues:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We owe to the perfect liberty
which the church has among us,
and to the apostolic zeal of its excellent
prelates, the reformation of
the clergy, the amendment of
morals, and the reduction of
crimes; which is so great that in
our population of a million there
are not enough criminals to fill the
penitentiary.</p>

<p>“To the church also we owe
those religious corporations which
produce such an abundance of excellent
results by the instruction of
childhood and youth, and by the
succor which they give so liberally
to the sick and to the destitute.
We are also debtors to these religious
for the renewal of the spirit
of piety in this year of jubilee and
of sanctification, and for the conversion
to Christianity and civilization
of nine thousand savages in the
eastern province, in which, on account
of its vast extent, there are
good reasons for establishing a
second vicariate. If you authorize
me to ask the Holy See for this
foundation, we will then consult as
to what measures to take to promote
the commerce of this province,
and to put an end to the
selfish speculations and the violent
exactions to which its poor inhabitants
have been a prey by reason
of the cruelty of inhuman merchants.
The laborers, however, for
this field are not now to be had;
and that those which we shall have
may be properly trained, it is right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697">[697]</a></span>
that you should give a yearly
subsidy to our venerable and
zealous archbishop, to assist him in
building the great seminary which
he has not hesitated to begin, trusting
in the protection of Heaven and
in our co-operation.</p>

<p>“Do not forget, legislators, that
our little successes would be ephemeral
and without fruit if we had not
founded the social order of our republic
upon the rock, always resisted
and always victorious, of the
Catholic Church. Its divine teaching,
which neither men nor nations
can neglect and be saved, is the
rule of our institutions, the law of
our laws. Docile and faithful
children of our venerable, august,
and infallible Pontiff, whom all the
great ones of the earth are abandoning,
and who is being oppressed by
vile, cowardly, and impious men, we
have continued to send him monthly
the little contribution which you
voted in 1873. Though our weakness
obliges us to remain passive
spectators of his slow martyrdom,
let us hope that this poor gift may
at least be a proof of our sympathy
and affection, and a pledge of our
obedience and fidelity.</p>

<p>“In a few days the term for
which I was elected in 1869 will expire.
The republic has enjoyed
six years of peace, interrupted only
by a revolt of a few days in 1872 at
Riobamba, of the natives against
the whites; and in these six years
it has advanced rapidly on the path
of true progress under the visible
protection of divine Providence.
The results achieved would certainly
have been greater if I had possessed
the abilities for government
which unfortunately I lack, or if
all that was needed to accomplish
good was ardently to desire it.</p>

<p>“If I have committed faults, I
ask pardon for them a thousand
times, and beg it with tears from
all my countrymen, feeling confident
that they have been unintentional.
If, on the contrary, you
think that in any respect I have
succeeded, give the honor of the
success, in the first place, to God
and to his Immaculate Mother, to
whom are committed the inexhaustible
treasures of his mercy; and, in
the second place, to yourselves, to
the people, to the army, and to all
those who, in the different branches
of the government, have assisted me
with intelligence and fidelity in the
fulfilment of my difficult duties.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Gabriel Garcia Moreno.</span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Quito</span>, August, 1875.”</p>

</div>

<p>That is the way that a really
Catholic ruler can speak, even in
this XIXth century. It seems,
while we read his words, as if we
were listening to Ferdinand of Castile
or some other one of the saintly
kings of the most prosperous days
of Christianity. With great justice,
then, did the government of Ecuador,
when it published this message&mdash;which
was found, as we have said,
on Moreno’s dead body&mdash;append
to it the following note:</p>

<p>“The message which we have just
given is the solemn voice of one who
is dead; or, better, it is his last will
and testament actually sealed with
his own blood; for our noble president
had just written it with his own
hand when he was assailed by his
murderers. Its last words are
those of a dying father who, blessing
his children, turns for the last
time toward them his eyes, darkened
by the shadow of death, and
asks pardon of them, as if he had
been doing anything during all
their lives but loading them with
benefits. Deeply moved and distressed
by grief, we seek in vain for
words adequate to express our love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698">[698]</a></span>
and veneration for him. Posterity
no doubt will honor the undying
memory of the great ruler, the wise
politician, the noble patriot, and
the saintly defender of the faith
who has been so basely assassinated.
His country, worthily represented
by their present legislators, will
shed tears over this tomb which
contains such great virtues and such
great hopes, and will gratefully record
on imperishable tablets the
glorious name of this her son, who,
regardless of his own blood and
life, lived and died only for her.”</p>

<p>This splendid eulogy is an echo
of the eternal benediction and a reflection
of the brilliant crown which
we cannot doubt that God has given
to this his latest martyr.</p>

<h4>IV.</h4>

<p>The reader will see that this message
of Garcia Moreno contains a
true and genuine scheme of Christian
government which he applied
in the republic of Ecuador, in direct
opposition to the ideas and
aspirations of modern liberalism.
Every point of it is in most marked
contrast to the liberalist programme.
At some risk of repetition,
we will here make a short
comparison between the two, on
account of the importance of the
conclusions which all prudent men
can draw from it.</p>

<p>Moreno begins with God, and
puts him at the head of the government
of his people; liberalism
would have the state atheistic, and
is ashamed even to mention the
name of God in its public documents.
Moreno desires an intimate
union between the state and
the Catholic Church, declaring that
the social order must be founded
on the church, and that her divine
teaching must be the rule of human
institutions and the law of civil
laws; liberalism, on the other hand,
not only separates the state from
the church, but even raises it above
her, and makes the civil laws the
standard in harmony with which
the ecclesiastical laws must be
framed. It even would subject the
most essential institutions of the
church to the caprice of man.
Moreno desires full liberty for the
bishops, and ascribes to this liberty
the reform of the clergy and the
good morals of the people; liberalism
wants to fetter episcopal action,
excites the inferior clergy to
rebellion against their prelates, and
endeavors to withdraw the people
from the influence of either. Moreno
not only supports but multiplies
religious communities; liberalism
suppresses them. Moreno respects
ecclesiastical property, and
promotes by the resources of the
state the foundation of new seminaries,
saying that without them it will
not be possible worthily to fill the
ranks of the sacred ministry; liberalism
confiscates the goods of the
church, closes the seminaries, and
sends the young Levites to the barracks,
to be educated in the dissipation
and license of military life.
Moreno confides to the clergy and
to the religious orders the training
and instruction of youth; liberalism
secularizes education, and insists
on the entire exclusion of the
religious element. Moreno removes
from his Catholic nation the wiles
and scandals of false religion; liberalism
promulgates freedom of
worship, and opens the door to
every heresy in faith and to every
corruption in morals. Moreno,
finally, sees in himself the weakness
inherent in man, and gives God
credit for all the good which he accomplishes;
while liberalism, full
of satanic pride, believes itself capable
of everything, and places all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">[699]</a></span>
its confidence in the natural powers
of man. The antagonism between
the two systems is, in short, universal
and absolute.</p>

<p>Now, what is the verdict of experience?
It is that the application
of Moreno’s system has resulted
in peace, prosperity, the moral
and material welfare of the people&mdash;in
a word, social happiness. On
the contrary, the application of the
liberalist system has produced discord,
general misery, enormous taxation,
immorality among the people,
and public scandals, and has
driven society to the verge of destruction
and dissolution. The liberty
which it has given has been
well defined by Moreno; it is the
liberty of a corpse, the liberty to
rot.</p>

<p>And at this juncture the infamous
wickedness and the despicable
logic of the liberalist party can
no longer be concealed. It has
laid it down as certain that the
principles of the middle ages, as it
calls them&mdash;which are the true Catholic
principles, the principles affirmed
by our Holy Father Pius
IX. in his Syllabus&mdash;are not applicable
to modern times, and can no
longer give happiness to nations.
But here is a ruler, Garcia Moreno
by name, who gives the lie to this
grovelling falsehood, and shows, by
the irresistible evidence of facts,
that the happiness of his people
has actually come simply from the
application of these principles.
What is the answer of the liberalist
sect to this manifest confutation
of their theory? First, it endeavors
to cry down its formidable
adversary by invective and calumny;
and then, finding that this does
not suffice to remove him from
public life, it murders him. This
is the only means it has to prove
its thesis; and, having made use
of it, it begins to shriek louder
than before that Catholic principles
cannot be adapted to the progress
of this age. No, we agree
that they cannot, if you are going
to kill every one who adapts them.
What use is it to argue with a sect
so malicious and perverse? O patience
of God and of men, how
basely are you abused!</p>

<h3>A REVIVAL IN FROGTOWN.</h3>

<p>There was quite an excitement
in Frogtown. The Rev. Eliphalet
Notext, “The Great Revivalist,
who had made more converts than
any other man in England, Ireland,
Scotland, Wales, the United States
and Territories, and the British
Provinces of North America,” was
to “open a three weeks’ campaign”
in the town.</p>

<p>Now, Frogtown prided itself on
being the wickedest little town in
the West. Its inhabitants claimed
for it the enviable distinction of
being “the fastest little village of
its size in the United States”&mdash;a
weakness common to most small
towns. This pride in vice is a widespread
weakness. The lean and
slippered pantaloon will wag his
fallen chaps and give evident signs
of pleasant titillation when some
shank-shrunken contemporary tells
“what a rascal the dog was in his
youth.”</p>

<p>Well, the Frogtowners flattered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700">[700]</a></span>
themselves that Brother Notext
would find their burgh a very hard
nut to crack. Brother Notext was
not a theologian. He was not a
scholar. He was not a preacher.
In truth, he was almost illiterate.
But he understood the “business”
of getting up revivals. He knew
how to create a sensation. He
could, at least, achieve a success of
curiosity, as the French say.</p>

<p>He began with the newspapers,
of course. He contrived to have
them say something about him and
his “work” in every issue. He
was not particular whether what
they said of him was favorable or
unfavorable. Indeed, he rather
preferred that some of them should
abuse him roundly. Abuse sometimes
helped him more than praise.
It made some people his friends
through a spirit of contradiction.
It appealed to the pugnacious instincts
of some “professors of religion.”
It enabled him to hint that
the inimical editors were papal
myrmidons, Jesuit emissaries, etc.,
etc.</p>

<p>The Rev. Eliphalet was really
an excellent organizer. He had
been originally the business manager
of a circus. His advertisements,
his posters, his hand-bills, in
his old occupation, were prepared
with all the gorgeous imagery of
the East. He did not forget his
old tactics in his new profession.
Immediately on his arrival in Frogtown
he grappled the newspapers.
He begged, bullied, or badgered the
editors until they noticed him. He
set the Christian Juveniles and the
kindred societies to work, with
whom, of course, there was no difficulty.
In a couple of days he succeeded
in drawing around him the
clergymen of every denomination,
except the Episcopalian and Unitarian.
Some of these, however,
went much against their will. The
Episcopalian minister&mdash;a gentle,
amiable man&mdash;was very loath at
first; but the pressure brought to
bear upon him was too strong. He
finally succumbed and joined in
what was called a Union Christian
Meeting of all the Protestant congregations.
This important point
achieved, Mr. Notext had three of
the “best workers” in each congregation
selected. These he sent
among the people to raise the
sinews of war, without which no
campaign, whether sacred or profane,
can be conducted to a successful
issue. Mr. Notext’s terms were
reasonable&mdash;only three hundred
dollars a week and found. A man
must live; and when a man works
hard&mdash;as Mr. Notext undoubtedly
did&mdash;he must live well, or he cannot
stand the strain on his physical
and mental strength. Then,
there were blank weeks when he
had no revival in hand, and probably
a hotel bill to pay. Taking
these things into consideration, any
reasonable person will allow that
three hundred dollars a week and
found was not an exorbitant price.</p>

<p>Mr. Notext had a large tent
which the profane said had been
formerly used in his old business.
It was pitched in a vacant lot within
the city limits, and could accommodate
about fifteen hundred
persons. Mr. Notext prevailed on
the clergymen who united with him
to close their churches on the first
Sunday of his revival. On the previous
Friday he gathered around
him a number of male and female
enthusiasts. Accompanied by these
people, organized in squads and
led by the regular revival practitioners
who did what is profanely
termed the “side-show”
business in all Mr. Notext’s tours,
he sang hymns in front of every
drinking-saloon in the town. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_701" id="Page_701">[701]</a></span>
instrumental accompaniment to
the singing was furnished by a
melodeon, which was carried about
in a one-horse cart.</p>

<p>On Sunday the union meetings
began, and, notwithstanding a heavy
rain, the tent was full. A large platform
had been erected inside, and
near the door was a table on which
were exposed for sale a great variety
of contributions to religious
literature, all by one author, who
had evidently tried every string of
the religious lyre. There were collections
of hymns by the Rev. Mr.
Notext; tracts by the Rev. Mr.
Notext; sermons by the Rev. Mr.
Notext; tales for the young by the
Rev. Mr. Notext; appeals to the
old by the Rev. Mr. Notext; reasons
for the middle-aged by the
Rev. Mr. Notext, etc., etc. There
were photographs, in every style, of
the Rev. Mr. Notext, as well as
likenesses of remarkable converts
who had been remarkable rascals
until they “got religion” through
the efforts of the Rev. Mr. Notext.</p>

<p>On the platform were seated the
shepherds of most of the flocks in
Frogtown. Some among them, it
is true, did not seem quite at home
in that situation, but they had to be
there. In the centre of the platform
was an organ, which furnished the
instrumental music. On each side
of the organ seats were arranged
for a volunteer choir. Fully half
those present were children.</p>

<p>The Rev. Eliphalet Notext was
introduced to the audience by the
minister of the Methodist church.
The revivalist was a stout, fair-haired,
fresh-colored, rather pleasant-looking
man, inclined to corpulency,
evidently not an ascetic,
and gifted with no inconsiderable
share of physical energy and magnetism.</p>

<p>“I wish all persons who can sing
to come on the platform and occupy
the seats to the right and left
of the organ,” he began.</p>

<p>No movement was made in response
to this call. It was repeated
with a better result. A dozen
young ladies summoned up enough
courage to mount the platform.</p>

<p>“This will never do!” cried Mr.
Notext. “I want every person
present who can sing right here on
this stand. We can’t get along
without music and plenty of it.”</p>

<p>“Brethren,” he continued, turning
toward the clergymen on the
platform, “you know the singers
in your congregations; go among
them and send them up here.
Everybody must put his shoulder
to the wheel in the great work of
bringing souls to Jesus.”</p>

<p>The brethren meekly did as they
were bid. They soon succeeded
in filling the seats reserved for the
singers. These numbered about
one hundred.</p>

<p>“That’s more like it,” said Mr.
Notext approvingly. “Now, my
friends, we will begin by singing a
hymn. I want everybody to join
in.” (A nod to the organist, who
began to play.)</p>

<p>The singing was rather timid at
first, but, led by Mr. Notext, the
singers rapidly gained confidence,
and soon rolled forth in full chorus.
Having fairly launched them, their
leader, after the first verse, left
them to take care of themselves.
The singing was really good. The
rich volume of harmony drowned
the commonplace melody and the
vulgar words. Thus Brother Notext
was successful in the production
of his first effect. It was
evident that he depended much on
the singing. There is nothing like
a grand mass of choral music to
excite the sensibilities. After two
or three hymns, the revivalist had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_702" id="Page_702">[702]</a></span>
his audience in a highly emotional
condition. “I want all the children
together in front!” shouted Mr.
Notext. “<em>Ad</em>ults [the accent on
the first syllable] will retire to the
back seats. Don’t stop the music!
Keep up the singing! Go on! go
on!” Then he ran to the organ,
whispered something to the organist,
and led off with</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Oh! you must be a lover of the Lord,</div>
<div class="verse">Or you won’t go to heaven when you die,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">leaving the singers to sing it out
for themselves after the first two or
three lines.</p>

<p>It took some time to get all the
children to the front. If the music
flagged, Mr. Notext shouted to
the singers to “keep it up.” From
time to time he would rush to the
organ, pick up a hymn-book in a
frantic manner, and lead off with a
new hymn, waving his hands in cadence,
but, with a due regard for
his lungs, not singing a note more
than was absolutely necessary to
start the other singers afresh.</p>

<p>The fathers and mothers of the
little ones, softened by the music,
looked with moistened eyes on their
children as the latter took their
seats. The American people are
very fond of children when they
are old enough to walk and talk
and be interesting. Mr. Notext
was alive to this fact. Even the
worst criminal or the most cynical
man of the world cannot help being
touched while music charms
his ears and his eyes look on the
beautiful spectacle of childish innocence.
Mr. Notext evidently
knew the more amiable weaknesses
of human nature. He appealed
to the senses and the affections,
and won over the fathers and mothers
through the children.</p>

<p>“Now, my little friends,” said
Mr. Notext, “I wish you all to
keep perfectly silent while I am
talking to you. This first meeting
is especially for you.”</p>

<p>There was considerable buzzing
among the little ones.</p>

<p>“I must have silence, if I am to
do anything with these children,”
said Mr. Notext rather testily, and
in a tone which showed that he
would not scruple to apply the birch
to his little friends if they did not
keep quiet. “The slightest noise
distracts their attention. There are
some boys to the right there who are
still talking! I wish some one
would stop them.”</p>

<p>A softly-stepping gentleman with
long hair and green goggles went
to the designated group, remonstrated
with, and finally succeeded
in silencing, them. Then Mr. Notext
began his sermon to the children.
He told the story of the Passion
in a manner which, though it
inexpressibly shocked Christians of
the old-fashioned kind who happened
to be present, was exceedingly
dramatic&mdash;“realistic” in the
highest degree, to borrow a word
from the modern play-bill. Suddenly
he broke off and said rather
excitedly:</p>

<p>“There is a boy on the fourth
bench who persists in talking. I
must have absolute silence, or I
cannot hold the attention of these
children. The slightest noise distracts
them and takes their minds
away from the picture I am endeavoring
to present to them. It
is that red-haired boy! Will somebody
please to take him away?”
Several pious gentlemen bore
down on the poor little red-haired
urchin, and all chance of “getting
religion” was taken away from him
for the nonce by his summary removal.
When silence was restored, Mr.
Notext resumed the story. When
describing how the divine Victim
was buffeted and spat upon, he a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_703" id="Page_703">[703]</a></span>dministered
to himself sounding
slaps on the face, now with the
left hand, now with the right.
He placed an imaginary crown of
thorns on his head, pressed the
sharp points into his forehead, and,
passing the open fingers of both
hands over his closed eyes and
down his face, traced the streams
of blood trickling from the cruel
wounds. Tears already rolled
down the cheeks of the little ones.
When he reached the nailing to the
cross, he produced a large spike,
exhibited it to the children, and
went through the semblance of
driving it into his flesh. An outburst
of sobs interrupted him.
Some of the children screamed in
very terror. The desired effect
was produced. Many fathers and
mothers, touched by the emotion
and terror of their children, wept
in sympathy with them.</p>

<p>“Now the music!” shouted Mr.
Notext, stamping with impatience,
as if he wanted a tardy patient to
swallow a Sedlitz-powder in the
proper moment of effervescence.
“Now the music!” And he led
off with</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Oh! you must be a lover of the Lord,</div>
<div class="verse">Or you won’t go to heaven when you die!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He shouted to the “workers” to
go among the people and ask them
to “come to Jesus.” A crowd of
“workers,” some professional, some
enthusiastic volunteers, broke loose
upon the audience. They seized
people by the hands. They
embraced them. They inquired:
“How do you feel now? Do you
not feel that Jesus is calling you?”
They begged them to come to Jesus
at once. They asked them if they
were “Ker-istians.”</p>

<p>One of the workers met two gentlemen
who entered together and
were evidently present through
curiosity. Of the first, who seemed
to be a cool, keen, self-poised business
man, the worker asked the
stereotyped question:</p>

<p>“Are you a Ker-istian?”</p>

<p>“Of course, of course,” said the
self-possessed business man.</p>

<p>The worker passed on, perfectly
satisfied with the off-hand declaration.
He repeated the question to
the gentleman’s companion, who,
possessed of less assurance, hesitated
and humbly replied:</p>

<p>“I trust so.”</p>

<p>The worker immediately grappled
the sensitive gentleman, much to
his mortification, and it was some
time before he succeeded in effecting
his escape, regretting, doubtless,
that he had not made as prompt
and satisfactory a profession of
faith as that of his companion.</p>

<p>The “inquiry meeting,” as the
exercises toward the close were
named, was continued until late in
the afternoon. When the children
were dismissed, they were instructed
to beg their parents to come to
Jesus&mdash;to entreat them, with tears
if necessary, until they consented.
A Presbyterian gentleman of the
old school, describing his sensations
after the meeting was over, said:</p>

<p>“I cannot deny that I was affected.
I felt tears coming to my eyes&mdash;why,
I could not tell. The effect,
however, was entirely physical.
My reason had nothing to do with
it. It condemned the whole thing
as merely calculated to get up an
unhealthy excitement, which, even
if not injurious, would be fleeting
in its effect. I noticed some nervous
women almost worked up into
spasms. As to the children, they
were goaded into a state of nervousness
and terror which was pitiable
to see. I can only compare
my own condition to that of a man
who had drunk freely. While the effect
lasted I was capable of making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_704" id="Page_704">[704]</a></span>
a fool of myself, being all the while
aware that I was doing so. Sunlight
and air have dispelled the intoxication,
and now nothing remains
but nausea.</p>

<p>“I am disgusted with such claptrap,
and ashamed of myself for
having been affected by it, however
temporarily and slightly.”</p>

<p>The progress made on the first
Sunday of the revival was duly
chronicled in the newspapers of
the day following. It was announced
that hundreds of children
had been awakened to a sense of
their sinful condition. A little
girl&mdash;four years old&mdash;had recognized
that she was thoroughly
steeped in sin. She had had no
idea of the condition of her soul
until she was roused to it by Mr.
Notext’s preaching. She was now
perfectly happy. She had experienced
religion. She knew she was
forgiven. She had gone to Jesus,
and Jesus had come to her. She
had sought Mr. Notext’s lodgings,
leading her father with one hand
and her mother with the other.</p>

<p>Charley Biggs&mdash;the well-known
drunken alderman&mdash;was among the
converted. He had “got religion,”
and was resolved henceforth to
touch the time-honored toddy
nevermore.</p>

<p>A belated “local” of one of
the newspapers, while returning to
his lodgings on the previous evening,
had his coat-tail pulled, much
to his surprise, by a little girl
about six years old.</p>

<p>“Please, sir,” she asked, “do
you know Jesus?”</p>

<p>The “local” was struck dumb.</p>

<p>“O sir!” she continued, “won’t
you please come to Jesus?”</p>

<p>This was enough. The hard
heart-of the “local” was touched.
He sobbed, he wept, he cried
aloud. He fell upon his knees.
The little girl fell on hers. They
sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Come to Jesus,</div>
<div class="verse">Come to Jesus,</div>
<div class="verse">Come to Jesus just now,” etc.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the “local” rose, after the
conclusion of the singing, he took
the little girl’s hand and went
whither she led him. He, too, had
“got religion”&mdash;somewhat as one
gets a <i lang="fr">coup de soleil</i> or a stroke of
paralysis.</p>

<p>The opposition dailies mildly
called attention to the purely emotional
character of the effects produced.
They expressed their fears
that the moral and physical result
of factitious excitement on minds
of tender years might be the reverse
of healthy. The next day the
melodeon was carted about again
and the singing continued on the
sidewalks and in front of the drinking-saloons.
Mr. Notext’s machinery
was in full blast. The
meeting on the second evening
was devoted principally to grown
people. The tent was full. The
choir was strengthened by additional
voices, and the music was
good of its kind.</p>

<p>After half a dozen hymns had
been sung, Mr. Notext began his
sermon&mdash;by courtesy so-called.
He first spoke of the number of
persons he had converted at home
and abroad. For he had been
“abroad,” as he took care to let
his audience know. He had been
the guest and the favored companion
of the Duchess of Skippington,
of the Earl of Whitefriars, of
Lord This and Lady That, and the
Countess of Thingumy. In Scotland
and in Ireland immense
crowds followed him and “got
religion.” He converted three
thousand people in a single town in
Ireland. Since the meeting on the
previous day, many children, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_705" id="Page_705">[705]</a></span>
many adults as well, had visited him
at his lodgings. Some who came to
the tent “to make fun” went away
full of religion. He would now
let a dear little friend of his tell
his own story in his own way.</p>

<p>A red-haired youngster, about
thirteen, was introduced to the audience
as the nephew of a prominent
and well-known official in a
neighboring town. (It was afterwards
stated, by the way, that the
official in question had not a nephew
in the world. No doubt the
youngster imposed on Mr. Notext.)
If ever there were a thoroughly
“bad boy,” this youngster was one,
or&mdash;as may be very possible&mdash;his
face belied him atrociously. Mr.
Notext placed his arm dramatically&mdash;affectionately,
rather&mdash;around the
young rogue’s neck, and led him to
the front of the platform. The boy
looked at the audience with a leer,
half-impudent, half-jocular, and
then gave his experiences glibly in
a very harsh treble:</p>

<p>“When first I heard that Rev.
Mr. Notext was going to get up a
revival, I joked about it with other
boys, and said he couldn’t convert
me; and the night of the first meeting
I said to the other boys&mdash;who
were bad boys, too&mdash;for us to go
along and make fun. And so we
did. And I came to laugh at Mr.
Notext and to make fun. And
somehow&mdash;I don’t know how it was&mdash;I
got religion, and I was converted;
and now I am very happy, and
I love Mr. Notext, and I am going
with him to Smithersville when he
gets through here. And I am very
happy since I was converted and
became a good boy.” (Sensation
among the audience, and music by
the choir in response to Mr. Notext’s
call.)</p>

<p>Another juvenile convert was
brought forward. He repeated
substantially the same story as his
predecessor, though more diffidently.
(More music by the choir.)</p>

<p>Mr. Notext now told the affecting
story of “little Jimmy.” Little
Jimmy was a native of Hindostan.
He lived in some town ending in <em>an</em>.
There was in that town a missionary
school. Jimmy’s master was
a very bad man&mdash;cruel, tyrannical.
He forbade Jimmy to go to the
mission-school. But Jimmy went,
nevertheless, whenever he could.
The master was a true believer in
the national religion of Hindostan.
He believed that Jimmy would go
to perdition if he left his ancestral
faith to embrace the national religion&mdash;or
rather the governmental
religion&mdash;of Great Britain. Jimmy
would return from his visits to the
mission-school in a very happy
mood, singing as he went:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Yes, I love Jesus,</div>
<div class="verse">Yes, I love Jesus,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">I know, I know I do,” etc.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Notext gave an operatic rendering
of the scene of Jimmy going
home singing the above words.
One day the master heard Jimmy,
and was roused to a state of fury.
He forbade the boy to sing the song.
But Jimmy would sing it (Mr. Notext
did not say whether Jimmy
sang the hymn in English or
Hindostanee). Then the brutal
master took an enormous cowhide&mdash;or
the Hindostanee punitive equivalent
thereto&mdash;and belabored poor
Jimmy. But Jimmy continued to
sing, though the tears rolled down
his cheeks from pain. And the master
flogged; and Jimmy sang. And
still the master flogged and flogged.
And still Jimmy sang and sang and
sang. It was like the famous fight
in Arkansas, wherein the combatants
“fit and fit and fit.” But
there must be an end of everything&mdash;even
of an Arkansas fight. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_706" id="Page_706">[706]</a></span>
struggle lasted for hours. Exhausted
nature finally gave way, and poor
little Jimmy died under the lash,
singing with his last breath:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Yes, I love Jesus,</div>
<div class="verse">Yes, I love Jesus,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">I know, I know I do.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Now, my friends,” said Mr.
Notext, “I want you all to stand
up for Jesus and sing poor little
Jimmy’s song.” And Mr. Notext
led off. The choir followed his example;
but the audience remained
seated.</p>

<p>“I want to know,” said Mr. Notext
rather testily, “how many
Christians there are in this assembly.
I want every one of them to
stand up!”</p>

<p>Several persons now stood up,
and gradually the action began to
spread, like yawning in a lecture-room.
There were still many,
however, who had not hearkened
to Mr. Notext’s summons to stand
up. He called attention to them,
and bade some of the brethren go
to them and talk them into an erect
position. Some of the recalcitrants,
evidently to avoid importunity,
stood up. The rest also stood
up, and hurriedly left the tent, followed
by an angry scowl from Mr.
Notext. After a little hesitation,
he said: “We will now once more
sing little Jimmy’s hymn.” And
when the hymn was sung, the meeting
dispersed.</p>

<p>Next morning the friendly newspapers
chronicled the wonderful
success of Mr. Notext’s efforts.
The number of converts was miraculously
large. Two thousand
persons had stood up for Jesus.
The meetings were continued during
the week. The <i lang="la">modus operandi</i>
was about the same. Mr. Notext
repeated himself so often that interest
began to languish and his
<i lang="fr">coups de théâtre</i> to grow flat and
stale. When he was at a loss for
words to continue one of his disjointed
discourses, he took refuge
in music and hymns.</p>

<p>“Brethren, let us sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Come to Jesus!</div>
<div class="verse">Come to Jesus!</div>
<div class="verse">Come to Jesus just now,” etc.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When his vulgar and often unintentionally
blasphemous exhortations
failed to hold the attention
of his hearers, and Morpheus was
making fight against him in sundry
corners of the tent, he would suddenly
call in his loudest tones on
all present to stand up for Jesus.
In cases of very marked inattention,
he would summon his hearers,
and particularly the children, to
write down their names for Jesus
in a large book kept for that purpose
by the great revivalist. This
stroke generally roused the audience
pretty thoroughly. But when
the children had written their names
in the book three or four times,
they began to grow tired of the
practice, thinking that, if these writing
lessons were continued, they
might as well be at school.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the second
week there were unmistakable signs
of impending collapse. The revival
received a momentary impulse,
however, from the opposition of
another “Reverend Doctor,” who
challenged Mr. Notext to controversy.
This aroused the natural
desire to witness a “fight” which
lives in the human heart. But the
desire was not gratified, owing to
Mr. Notext’s refusal to accept the
challenge. His failure to exhibit
a proper polemical pugnacity was a
very great detriment to him. Indeed,
the end of the second week
showed a marked falling off in the
number of persons present at the
nightly meetings. Then the sinews<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_707" id="Page_707">[707]</a></span>
of war began to fail. The weekly
wage of the great revivalist could
not be raised, though he thrice sent
back “the best workers” in all the
congregations to make additional
efforts to raise the stipulated sum.</p>

<p>The Rev. Dr. Notext did not
tarry very much longer in Frogtown.
He had barely turned his
back upon the little town before
every trace of the “great tidal wave
of the revival” (as the journals
called it) had disappeared. The
youthful converts had gone back to
their peg tops, their kites, and their
china alleys, and Alderman Charley
Biggs was again taking his whiskey-toddies
in the time-honored way.</p>

<h3>THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.</h3>

<p>The President’s message, so far
as it deals with the school question
and the taxation of church property,
is the sequel to the speech
which he delivered at Des Moines.
The article on that oration which
appeared in our last number was, to
some extent, an exposition of our
views on the school question.</p>

<p>We are sure that those views,
when carefully examined, will be
found to contain the only solution
in harmony with the spirit of
free institutions. We are willing to
submit to the fairness of our fellow-citizens,
and to wait until time
and thought have matured their
judgment on the following questions:</p>

<p>1. Who has a right to direct the
education of children&mdash;their parents
or the government?</p>

<p>2. Whether, in a republic whose
form of government depends more
than any other upon the virtue of its
citizens, it is better to have moral
instruction given in abundance, or
to have this species of instruction
restricted to the narrowest limits?</p>

<p>3. Whether it is the design of a
free government to legislate for
all, or whether public institutions&mdash;the
common schools, for instance&mdash;are
to be directed only for the
benefit of certain classes?</p>

<p>4. Whether moneys raised by
taxation for the common good
should not be so applied as to
satisfy the conscientious demands
of all citizens?</p>

<p>5. Whether taxation otherwise
directed than for the good of all
is not a violation of the maxim,
“Taxation without representation
is tyranny”?</p>

<p>6. Whether Catholics have or
have not shown zeal for education,
both primary and scientific?</p>

<p>7. Whether they have or have
not shed their blood in defence of
the nation, or furnished any of its
great leaders in peace and war?</p>

<p>8. Whether any instance can be
shown in which they have entered
or inhabited any country on equal
terms with Protestants and infidels,
and have abused their power to
hamper or persecute their fellow-citizens?</p>

<p>9. Whether, in paying their taxes
and supporting their own schools
to the best of their power, peacefully
discussing the question of
public welfare and their own rights,
Catholics are acting as loyal citizens
or as factious disturbers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_708" id="Page_708">[708]</a></span>
good-will and kindly feeling among
neighbors?</p>

<p>10. Finally, whether, in consideration
of the foregoing, our views
are not entitled to respectful consideration?</p>

<p>We have no doubt whatever that
when the thoughtful and just men
of our day and race have duly
pondered upon these subjects, we
shall fully agree with their deliberate
reply.</p>

<p>At no time in the history of our
country will it be found that Catholics
have introduced religion into
the arena of political discussion,
and any attempt to do so will meet
with failure. In this they are in
perfect accord with the principles
underlying our institutions and the
genuine spirit of this country. If, at
this moment, the rancor of ancient
bigotry and fanaticism or modern
hatred of Christianity has attempted
to awaken a political conflict on
religious grounds, while it refuses
to admit a calm consideration of
Catholic claims, we appeal from
Philip drunk to Philip sober.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we shall assume,
that there are those who wish to
hear more with regard to our principles
and convictions. We shall
endeavor to remove all obscurity on
the questions now under discussion,
and to reply to whatever reasonable
objections may be made against our
principles.</p>

<p>With regard to the taxation of
church property, we await the action
of the political world. Some
politicians, whose “vaulting ambition”
is of that kind which “o’erleaps
itself,” would introduce this
question into political discussion in
order to draw off the attention of
the American people from the real,
present issues in their politics. We
ask for no innovations; but if such
be made, let there be no discrimination.
We stand before the law as
do all other religious denominations.
“Let us have peace” were
the memorable words spoken at a
memorable time by a man who to a
large extent held the future of this
country in his hands. Those words
held, and hold still, the germs of
the wisest policy. We repeat them
now, and add, if we cannot have
peace, let us at least have fair play.
If the projectors and advocates of
this innovation suppose that, in the
event of its being carried out, they
will thereby worst the Catholic
Church, their action in the end will
be found to resemble that of the
man who cut off his nose to spite
his neighbor.</p>

<p>Since these words were written,
four letters have appeared in the
New York <cite>Times</cite> under the heading,
“Should Church Property be
Taxed?” and over the signature of
George H. Andrews. The writer
is not a Catholic. His clear, concise
reasons against the taxation of
church property, as recommended
by the President in his message,
will have the more weight with
non-Catholic readers on that account.
It is singular, yet natural,
to see how his argument strengthens
our own position on the question
in a number of ways, particularly
as regards the suicidal policy
of many who, through hatred or
fear of the Catholic Church, may
be induced to commit themselves
to a measure which would prove
an irreparable mischief to their own
church or churches. Passing by
the many able and suggestive points
in Mr. Andrews’ letters, we take just
such as more immediately bear on
the thoughts thrown out by ourselves.</p>

<p>By the census of 1870 the value
of all kinds of church property in
the United States belonging to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_709" id="Page_709">[709]</a></span>
leading denominations was placed
as follows:</p>

<p>“From these it appears,” says
Mr. Andrews, “that the relative
proportion of each denomination
to the whole is substantially as follows:</p>

<p>“Methodist, one-fifth of the aggregate;
Roman Catholic, one-sixth
of the aggregate; Presbyterian,
one-seventh of the aggregate; Baptist,
one-ninth of the aggregate;
Episcopalian, one-tenth of the aggregate;
Congregational, one-fourteenth
of the aggregate; Reformed,
one-twenty-second of the aggregate;
Lutheran, one-twenty-third of the
aggregate; Unitarian, one-fifty-ninth
of the aggregate; Universalist,
one-sixtieth of the aggregate.”</p>

<p>And here is the case in a nutshell:
“To me it seems obvious,”
comments Mr. Andrews, on reviewing
his figures, “that the expectation
is that those who belong or
are allied to other sects will, from
dislike to or fear of the Roman
Catholic Church, impose a burden
upon it, even if in doing so they
are obliged to assume an equal
burden themselves; or, in other
words, that the owners of $294,000,000
of church property will
subject it to taxation in order to
impose a similar tax upon the owners
of $60,000,000 of church property.
So that the adherents of
every other sect, at variance among
themselves about sundry matters of
doctrine and practice, essential and
non-essential, can be brought to
act in concert, and to give effect to
a common spirit of hostility to Roman
Catholic doctrine, to Roman
Catholic exclusiveness, Roman Catholic
aggression, and Roman Catholic
influence, by placing a tax
upon Roman Catholic Church property&mdash;in
effect, arousing a spirit
of persecution, qualified by the
condition imposed by the Constitution,
that the would-be persecutor
must share in the penalty he
may succeed in imposing upon the
object of his dislike.” Which is
precisely what we have characterized
as “cutting off one’s nose to
spite a neighbor.”</p>

<p>May we presume to ask whether
the taxation of church property
will reduce the expenses of the
general government, render its officials
more honest, and purify our
legislative halls? These are the
duties of the hour. Here are the
issues of our politics. But a profound
silence regarding them reigns
in the official utterance. Are the
projectors of the new policy afraid
to face them? Does their conscience
make cowards of them?
Or is it that they are playing the
part of the cuttle-fish?</p>

<p>Up to this period the state and
all religious denominations have
advanced peaceably to prosperity,
and there have been no real
grounds of complaint on any side.
At least we have heard of none publicly.
What, then, has brought
about this sudden change? Who
has called for it? Why should it
be sprung upon us at this moment?
No danger threatens from this quarter.
There is not visible on our
political horizon even the “cloud
no bigger than a man’s hand.”
Catholics, when only a handful,
never dreamed of objecting to the
exemption from taxation of the
property of other religious denominations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_710" id="Page_710">[710]</a></span>
or to the aid which their
benevolent institutions received.
Can it be the rapid development of
Catholicity here which has prompted
the proposed innovation? Are
these exemptions, which have been
handed down from the time of our
fathers, to be altered because Catholicity
has had her share in the
common progress? Let truth and
error grapple on a fair and open
field. Is there fear that truth will
be worsted in the struggle?</p>

<p>If the exemption of church property
from taxation be so great an
evil and danger to the country,
those whom Americans generally
are content to regard as their great
statesmen must have been very
short-sighted men after all to pass
by, one after another, so glaring an
evil. For the growth of church
property is not a thing of to-day.
In his message the President says
that he believes that “in 1850 the
church property of the United
States which paid no tax, municipal
or State, amounted to about eighty-three
million dollars. In 1860 the
amount had doubled. In 1875 it
is about one thousand million dollars.”</p>

<p>Mr. Andrews questions the estimate
for 1875 on the ground that
it is too high. But let that pass.
The following table, given by Mr.
Andrews, shows the increase in value,
according to the census, of the
property of the ten principal churches
for the last twenty years:</p>

<p>The gradation, it will be seen,
has been pretty steady, and is comparatively
no more marked in 1870
than it was in 1860, or than it was,
probably, in 1850. In that year,
however, the Catholics were led by
four religious bodies, and almost
equalled by one. Ten years later
they stood second, and after another
ten years second still. Surrounded
as they are by jealous foes,
they offer fair game, therefore, to
men in search of political prey.
All was right so long as the others
reaped an advantage over Catholics;
but the moment there appears
any prospect of Catholics reaping
an advantage equally with the rest,
the cry is: The country is in danger,
and can only be saved by taxing
church property. Who so
blind as not to see through this
flimsy pretext?</p>

<p>Not Mr. Andrews certainly, and
no words of ours could be more
forcible than his. “Discarding all
circumlocution,” he writes, “it is
as well to get down at once to the
bottom fact, which is that whatever
euphemistic phrases may be resorted
to, a desire to obstruct the
growth and circumscribe the influence
of the Roman Catholic
Church gives whatever vitality it
may possess to the proposition to
tax church property.”</p>

<p>But supposing this change to be
made, is it to be imagined for a
moment that the progress of the
church will be stopped by it?
That is futile. If, though so few in
numbers and at a great disadvantage,
the church was able to raise herself
to her present position; if, when
the exemptions were all in favor
of other denominations, Catholics
were able to make so great a progress,
is it to be supposed that by
these changes, and by placing other
denominations on an equality with
Catholics, the advancement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711">[711]</a></span>
the Catholic Church is to be retarded?</p>

<p>We have been trained in the
stern school of poverty. We are
accustomed to sacrifice. Our clergy
do not receive high salaries.
The personal expenses of his Eminence
the Cardinal-Archbishop are
much less than those of many a
clerical family in New York City.
Wherever we have arms to work
with, the church of God shall not
lack all that is necessary to give it
dignity, even if we have to pay
taxes for it besides. In Ireland
the priests and people have shared
their crust in the midst of the famine,
and in fear of death, until
within a few years. In Germany
we are now about to part with our
property, under the wicked injustice
of the state, rather than submit
to its interference in the affairs
of conscience. Is any person foolish
enough to imagine that a few
dollars, more or less, of taxation is
going to dishearten or frighten us?
If you want to make our people
more liberal, if you want to see
grand Catholic churches and the
cross overtopping roof and spire in
every city, just put us on our mettle.
Persecution is our legacy. Martyrdom
is our life. The cross on
our brows is no empty symbol.
These are our feelings. We have
no alarm whatever.</p>

<p>These proposed innovations are
only the entrance of a wedge that,
driven home, will disturb the foundations
of our government; will
create religious strife, and blast
the hopes of freedom, not only in
this country, but all the world over.
They count, however, without their
host who think that the American
people are prepared to enter on
such a career; and the politicians
who hope to ride into power by
awakening the spirit of fanaticism
and religious bigotry among us, if
their names be held in memory at
all, will at no remote period be
pointed out with the finger of scorn
and contumely as the disturbers
of that peace and harmony which
ought always to reign in a just
people, and which it is the true
policy of all government and the
duty of all citizens to foster and
maintain. We say nothing at the
present regarding the unconstitutionality
of these proposed innovations,
and of the secret banding
together of men to carry them
out.</p>

<h3>A NIGHT AT THE GRANDE CHARTREUSE.</h3>

<p class="center">FROM THE FRENCH OF SAINT-GENEST.</p>

<p>It is near midnight. I am alone
in my cell, awaiting the mysterious
guide who brought me hither, and
who will return to call me for the
office of Matins.</p>

<p>I listen to every sound, seeking
to understand its language. During
the first hour I still heard steps
from time to time in the distance;
then I half opened my door and
looked outside. At the end of the
cloister a white figure appeared,
carrying a small light in its hand.
It approached at a slow pace,
stopped near a pillar, and disappeared
under the arches.</p>

<p>Sometimes I have seen other
shadows pass along, and have heard
a few low-spoken words, …
bells which answered each other;
then, little by little, everything is
extinguished and silent.…
There is not another sound, another
breath; … but still I listen,
and cannot cease to listen.</p>

<p>Is it indeed myself who am in
this monastery? Was I, only to-day,
yet in the midst of the living?
Can one single day comprise so
many things? This which is just
ending has been so full, so strange,
that I cannot well recount all that
has happened in it.</p>

<p>And yet it was but this morning
that I was at Aix, in the midst of
light and noise and gayety.…
The children were gambolling
around me! All at once some one
said: “Suppose we go to the
Grande Chartreuse!” It was said
just as one would say anything else.
We set out, as if for an ordinary excursion,
a party of pleasure. Mme.
B&mdash;&mdash; had provisions in readiness,
which were increased by the additions
of other members of the party,
and we start in the midst of lively
speeches and merriment.</p>

<p>So long as we proceed along the
valley this is all very well. The
road rises and descends, running
through the vineyards, skirting the
rocks, while the warm breath of the
south gently moves the surrounding
verdure. Then, after piercing
the flank of the mountain, it slopes
down toward the plains of Dauphine,
discovering a horizon all
bathed in light.</p>

<p>It is after passing Saint Laurent,
at the foot of the <em>Desert</em>, and in
perceiving the entrance of the
gorge, that one begins to understand
something more; … it is
then that jesting is silenced and
gayety grows grave.</p>

<p>Then, on arriving at the Guiers-Mort,
we become altogether dumb.
Already we had ceased to laugh;
we now ceased to speak, but regarded
with a sort of stupefaction
this road without issue, which
seemed to end in chaos. The
mountains rose defiantly before us,
overlapping and mingling with
each other, and here and there barring
the way with huge masses of
precipitous rock; the gigantic trees
seem to rise to the clouds, and torrents
from unknown heights fall as
if from heaven, while the rocks
crowd upon, before, around, and
seem to say, “No farther shall you
go.” As we come to a turn, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_713" id="Page_713">[713]</a></span>
seems as if all progress were indeed
at an end; two immense blocks
fallen across each other completely
close the horizon.… We approach
them, however, and it opens again,
the rocks forming a sort of Titanic
vaulted roof overhead, and falling
again in the form of three bridges,
one above the other, the horses
continuing to climb a road which
the eye cannot take in.</p>

<p>And whilst one is lost in these
abysses, what a perfect dream of
splendor begins to break overhead!
Meadows of the most exquisite
green seem as if suspended far
above us, silvery rocks jutting out
from among their black firs, gigantic
oaks grasping the heights of the
precipices, their crowns of verdure
glittering in the wind.… It is a
fantastic apparition. One has visions
in one’s childhood of unknown
regions, of enchanted forests guarded
by genii, but one never thought
to contemplate these marvels in
reality.</p>

<p>Then, all at once, the mountains
separate, the torrents disappear,
and in the midst of a gorge rise
battlements and spires.… It is
the monastery. There it stands,
guarded by these lofty sentinels, in
this sombre amphitheatre, which
would be desolation itself if God
had not scattered there all the magical
beauties of his creation.</p>

<p>There is not a village, not a
cottage, not a wayfarer&mdash;nothing;
there is La Chartreuse. No solitude
can be compared to that!</p>

<p>On the summit of St. Bernard and
of the Simplon monasteries destined
for the relief of travellers present
themselves to the passage of the
nations. In the sandy deserts the
most isolated convents find themselves
in the road of the caravans;
but here this road conducts to nothing&mdash;it
is a silent gorge; it is the
Valley of Contemplation; it is the
greatest solitude that one can imagine.</p>

<p>And when from those heights
one has seen the gradual approach
of night; seen these masses of rock
and of verdure enfolded in the vast
shadows; and, at the summons of
the monastery bell, has seen the
last of the white robes descend from
the mountain, he feels that it is one
of those moments in a life which
will never be forgotten. Then,
after having stayed awhile to contemplate
this scene, I rose and
came to knock at this door, which
has been to so many others as the
gate of the tomb.… A Carthusian
monk brought me to my cell, went
his way in silence, and since then I
have been left to my reflections.</p>

<p>There are, then, men who in the
morning were in their homes, in
the midst of their friends, in life,
and stir, and the noise of the outer
world.… They have climbed
this mountain, they have sought
this <em>Desert</em>, have knocked at this
gate; it has closed upon them, …
and for ever.</p>

<p>They have, as I, sat down at this
table; they have gazed at the walls
of their cell, and have said to themselves:
“Behold henceforth my
horizon.” Then they have heard
the sound of these bells, the echo
of these litanies, and they have
said to themselves: “We shall
henceforth hear no other voice.”</p>

<p>You see, one reads these things
in the works of poets, one sees
them represented in the drama; but
one must find one’s self actually in
a real cell, and one must sleep there,
to conceive anything of the reality
of a monastic life.</p>

<p>To awake here in the morning;
to rise and eat, alone, the food
which comes to you through a little
wicket, like that of a prisoner;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_714" id="Page_714">[714]</a></span>
to meet, when one traverses the
cloister, other shadows who salute
you in silence; to go from the
church to the cell, from the cell to
the church, and to say to one’s self
that it is always and always to be
the same!</p>

<p>Always!… All through life;
or rather, there is no more life, no
more space, no more time. It is
the beginning of eternity. One is
on the threshold of the infinite,
and it seems as if all this nature
had only been created to give these
men a beginning of eternal repose.</p>

<p>Always alone! The thought crushes
one. No more to receive anything
from without; to nourish
one’s self with spiritualities alone;
to meditate, contemplate, and pray.
To pray always: … to pray for
those who never pray themselves;
to pray for those who have shattered
your life, and who, may be, have
led you hither; … to pray for
those who have despoiled your
monastery and outraged your habit&mdash;even
for the impious ones who
come to insult you in your very
hospitality! And for all this one
thing alone suffices: faith.</p>

<p>A bell has rung; it is the hour
of Matins. Some one knocks at
my door. I open, and they conduct
me to the little stall reserved
for travellers. At first the obscurity
is so great that it is difficult to
distinguish anything. The church
is empty, and none of the tapers
are lighted. Then a door opens in
the distance, and the monks enter
in procession, each holding a long
dark-lantern, of which the slanting
gleams dimly lessen the darkness
of the chapel. They repair to their
stalls, and the Office begins.</p>

<p>It consists principally of a monotonous
psalmody of an implacable
rhythm, of which one scarcely
perceives the first murmurs, and
which seems as if it would never
end. I gaze at these tall white figures,
these motionless heads.…
What has been the drama of life to
each one? What changes, without
and within, have led them there?
What have they suffered? And do
they suffer still? What has the
rule of their order done for them?&mdash;and
still the psalmody goes on.</p>

<p>At times they rise, uttering what
seems to be a sort of lamentation;
then they fall prostrate, with their
arms stretched out before them;
all the lights disappear; there is
nothing but darkness and silence;
it seems as if man himself were extinguished.
After which the lights
reappear, the psalmody recommences,
and thus it continues.</p>

<p class="break">When the rising sun shone upon
the summits of the rocks, I rose
from my pallet, exclaiming: “The
light at last! Hail to the light!” I
open my window and look out.…
There is no other place like this;
such as it was in the night, such is
it in the day. In vain may the sun
mount above the horizon to bring
warmth into this gorge&mdash;the monastery
remains cold and, as it were,
insensible; in vain his rays dart upon
the walls, glitter on the spires,
and set the rocks on fire.…
There are living men, but one does
not see them, one does not hear
them; only a wagon drawn by oxen
crosses the meadow, followed by
a monk, and some beggars are approaching
the monastery gate.</p>

<p>Then, without guide or direction,
I plunge into the forest in search
of the Chapel of S. Bruno. This
forest is of incomparable beauty;
neither Switzerland nor the Pyrenees
contain anything like it. Prodigious
trees rise to an immense
height, wrapping their gigantic
roots about the rocks. In the midst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_715" id="Page_715">[715]</a></span>
of the waters which murmur on
every side unknown vegetations
luxuriate, sheltering at their feet a
world of ferns, tall grass, and
mosses, every dewy feather and
spray being hung, as it were, with
precious stones, upon which the
sun darts here and there rays of
gold and touches of fire. There is
here a wild enchantment which
neither pen nor pencil ever can depict;
and in the midst of these
marvels rises, from a rock, the
Chapel of S. Bruno. There it was
that the visions appeared to him,
and there he caused a spring of water
to flow forth; but to me the
most wonderful of all the miracles
of his legend was that of his getting
there at all&mdash;the fact of his reaching
the foot of this desert, hatchet
in hand, cutting down the trees
which barred his entrance, wrestling
with wild animals, the masters
of this forest, and having no other
pathway than the torrent’s bed;
ever mounting upwards, in spite of
the streams, in spite of the rocks, in
spite of everything; never finding
himself lost enough, but ever struggling
higher and higher still. The
miracle is, too, that of his having fixed
himself at last upon that spot,
and to have called companions
around him, who constructed each
his little hermitage about his own;
that of having, in God’s name, taken
possession of these inaccessible
mountains, all of which are surmounted
by a cross, and to have
founded an order which spread itself
over the whole Christian world, and
which is still existing.</p>

<p>But the hour of departure has
arrived. At the moment of quitting
this solitude we again reflect.
France and Italy lie spread out
beneath our feet; … that is to
say, passions, hatred, strife.…
Why should we descend again?
Why resume the burden of ambitions,
rivalries, the harness of social
conventionalities? To what purpose
is it, since the end at last
must come alike to all?</p>

<p>We look around, we reflect, and
then, after having well meditated,
we all descend.</p>

<p>At the foot of the desert we find
again huts, then cottages, by and
by a village. With movement and
life we find our speech again, and
with speech discussion. Overwhelmed
until then by the wild beauty of
all around us and by the majesty
of its silence, the sceptics only now
recommence the criticisms which
were cut short the evening before:
“What services do these monks
render to mankind? To what purpose
do they bury themselves upon
those heights, when there is so
much to be done below?”</p>

<p>I answer nothing. These are
difficult questions. Later we shall
know which has chosen the better
part, those who act or those who
pray; only I remember that whilst
thirty thousand Israelites were
fighting in the plain, Moses, alone
on the mountain, with his arms
stretched out towards heaven, implored
the God of armies. When
his arms fell through weariness, the
Amalekites prevailed; and when he
raised them, Israel was victorious;
and seeing this, he caused his arms
to be supported, until the enemies
of Israel were overcome.</p>

<p>While we are debating we cross
Saint Laurent, Les Echelles, and
the Valley du Guiers. Here is
Chambéry <i lang="fr">en fête</i>, with its flags, its
concourse of <i lang="fr">francs-tireurs</i>, and
bands of music; but although we
have returned to outer life, we
have brought away with us something
of the solitude we have left,
where it seems as if the earth
ended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_716" id="Page_716">[716]</a></span></p>

<p>Believe me, reader, and do not forget
my words when you visit these
lands. The sight of La Grande
Chartreuse is one of the most powerful
emotions here below. To whatever
religion you may belong, if
your soul can be moved by the
thought of the life to come, you
will preserve an imperishable remembrance
of a night spent in this
monastery, and will feel that you
are not altogether the same man
that you were when you entered
its walls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Les Etats-Unis Contemporains, ou les
Mœurs, les Institutions et les Idees
depuis la Guerre de la Secession.</span>
Par Claudio Jannet. Ouvrage précédé
d’une Lettre de M. Le Play.
Paris: E. Plon. 1876.</p>

</div>

<p>The author of this volume has read
carefully and seriously a large number
of works, by different American, French,
and English writers, devoted to an explanation
of the institutions of the
United States, and to the history and social
condition of the country. He shows
also a remarkable acquaintance with the
magazines and newspapers of the United
States, so far as they bear on the subjects
of which he treats. His book, indeed,
must have cost him years of assiduous
labor.</p>

<p>M. Jannet gives a just and impartial
exposition of the laws and political principles
of our country, as also of its present
social condition. Rarely, if ever, has a
foreigner displayed so conscientious a
study of all that goes to make up American
civilization. He professes to have
entered upon his study and his work
without any preconceived theory&mdash;a profession
not unusual with authors, and for
the most part, probably, honestly made.
It is one thing, however, to profess, another
thing to adhere to the profession.
Were it possible for authors to adhere
strictly to the profession made by M.
Jannet, literature and all of which it
treats would certainly not suffer therefrom:
But he who imagines he has attained
to so just and fair a position is
the least free from illusion. The position
is simply unattainable, and M.
Jannet is scarcely to be blamed if he has
not quite reached his ideal.</p>

<p>Two classes of authors have written
about the United States. The one sees
almost everything in <i lang="fr">couleur de rose</i>, the
other in a sombre hue. M. Jannet belongs
to the latter class. Throughout
his volume he fastens upon every symptom
that threatens the existence or the
welfare of the republic. As an enumeration
of these symptoms it is exact,
and its perusal would do no harm to
our spread-eagle orators.</p>

<p>M. Jannet has evidently aimed at
counterbalancing the influence of writers,
French writers particularly, who
have exaggerated the good side of American
political society. He seems fearful
lest their tone of thought should have
too great a preponderance in France,
and influence its present transition-state
too powerfully in the direction of
the United States. Whether or not this
was called for is not a question for us to
consider. The book, regarded as an impartial
exposition of the present condition
of the United States, resembles the
picture of an artist, the background of
which is painted with a Preraphaelite
exactness, while the foreground is left
unfinished, and the whole work, consequently,
incomplete. Had the obvious
purpose of the book been proclaimed at
the beginning, we should have read it
with a more favorable eye.</p>

<p>In his last chapter, however, M. Jannet
holds out some hope for the future
of the American Republic. In our present
commercial depression, in the recent
success of the Democratic party, in
the number of families who have preserved
the primitive virtues and customs
of our forefathers, and in the progress of
Catholicity he sees a ground for this
hope, and concludes his work by saying:
“Men are everywhere prosperous or unfortunate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_717" id="Page_717">[717]</a></span>
according as they observe or
despise the divine law. All their free
will consists in choosing between these
two terms of the problem of life, and all
the efforts of the spirit of innovation only
break against, without ever being able to
destroy, the eternal bounds set by God to
the ambitious feebleness of the creature.
Therein lies the lesson that the young
republic of the New World sends from
beyond the ocean and across the mirage
of its rapid prosperity to the old nations
of Europe, too inclined to believe in the
sophisms of the great modern error, and
to mistrust their own traditions.”</p>

<p>M. Jannet’s work is worthy of a more
extended notice, which will be given it at
a later date. The book may be ordered
directly from the publisher in France.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Public Life of Our Lord.</span> II.
Preaching of the Beatitudes. By H.
J. Coleridge, S.J. London: Burns &amp;
Oates. 1875. (New York: Sold by
The Catholic Publication Society.)</p>

</div>

<p>This is a new volume in the series
which is intended, when complete, to
include the entire life of Jesus Christ.
We have already commended the preceding
volume, and can only, at present,
renew the expression of our concurrence
in the unanimous verdict of
competent judges, which awards a very
high meed of praise to Father Coleridge’s
work, so far as it is as yet given to the
public.</p>

<p>It is likely to become extensive when
fully completed, since the present volume
is filled up with the author’s introductory
remarks on the missionary life of
Our Lord, and the exposition of one portion
of the Sermon on the Mount&mdash;to
wit, the Beatitudes. It is a work which is,
strictly speaking, <i lang="la">sui generis</i> in our language,
and indeed in all modern literature,
and one hard to describe in such a
way as to give an accurate notion of its
quality and scope to a person who has
not read some portion of its contents.
The author has drawn from the most
various and from the purest sources,
and has himself meditated in a very attentive
and minute manner upon the
rich materials furnished him by the sacred
lore of his studies. He proceeds
leisurely, quietly, carefully, like the patient
illuminator of a manuscript text,
filling his pages with large and small
figures, all elaborately finished. The
present volume gives us a sketch of
Galilee, the scene of the preaching and
miracles of our divine Redeemer during
his first year of public ministry, which
makes at once the idea of that ministry,
of its extraordinary laboriousness, its extent,
and the multitude of wonderful
works comprehended within its brief
period, ten times more vivid than it can
be made by a mere perusal of the Gospel
narrative. In this respect it is especially
interesting and instructive for those
who are themselves engaged in missionary
labors. We have a picture placed
before our minds of the real nature of
Our Lord’s public life and ministry, and
grouped around it are other pictures, as
illustrations, from the lives of the great
missionary saints. When the author approaches
to his principal theme in this
volume&mdash;the Sermon on the Mount&mdash;he
makes the whole scene and all its circumstances
appear before us like a fine
dioramic view. He is not, however, of
that meretricious school to which Renan
and Beecher have given a false and momentary
<i lang="fr">éclat</i>, as unworthy of the divine
subject as the homage of another class
of witnesses on whom Our Lord frequently
imposed silence. The poetic,
literary, and picturesque charms of Father
Coleridge’s style are subservient to his
theological, doctrinal, and moral exposition
of sacred truths. It is the pure doctrine
of the Scriptures, and of the fathers,
doctors, and saints of the church, which
we are invited and allured to drink from
the ornamented chalice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Story of S. Peter.</span> By W. D. S.
London: Burns &amp; Oates. 1875. (New
York: Sold by The Catholic Publication
Society.)</p>

</div>

<p>This little book purports to be a simple
sketch of the life of the Prince of the
Apostles. It will serve to recall the
principal events in his life, and therefore
will possess a certain amount of interest
for Catholic readers. The binding, type,
and paper are neat and elegant. The
object of the book is evidently pious,
and therefore we shrink from criticising
it too minutely. The style also is pleasing
and readable. It is to be regretted,
however, that the author did not take a
little more pains with his task. It is a
good thing to have plenty of books on
Catholic subjects; and those who are
gifted with power, and who can command
the leisure, are, to a certain extent,
bound to write. But they are also bound
to study consistency and order, and, in
sending forth their productions, to show
a proper respect for those who are expected
to buy them. Good-will does not
excuse slovenliness, and we heartily
wish that “W. D. S.” had shown a deeper
sense of this truth. The fact that a
book is small and easily read does not
free the writer from a thorough analysis
of his subject and employment of all
sources of information regarding it. The
present work is serviceable as an introduction
to a real treatise on the position
and office of S. Peter. It is nothing
more; and we are sorry that it is not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Persecutions of Annam</span>: A History
of Christianity in Cochin China
and Tonking. By J. R. Shortland,
M.A. London: Burns &amp; Oates. 1875.
(New York: Sold by The Catholic Publication
Society.)</p>

</div>

<p>We read an account a few days since
of four hundred Catholic priests who
four years ago were transported from
Poland to Siberia by the Russian government;
three hundred have died, and
the others can survive but a little while.
It was only a paragraph in a newspaper.
The martyrs die as of old, and we scarcely
hear of their sufferings. The missionary
work of the church, too, is almost forgotten
by her children who are living at
ease and in comfort; and yet it is carried
on in all quarters of the globe. Our
brothers, if we be worthy to call them by
this name, are toiling, suffering, dying
for Christ and the souls of men in far-off
countries of which we seem not to care
even to know anything. Here is a book,
most interesting and consoling, full of
edifying facts and heroic examples, written
clearly and simply. It is a history
of Christianity in Cochin China and
Tonking; and as these two countries form
the Empire of Annam, and the history of
the church is always one of persecution,
of triumph through suffering, the book
is entitled <cite>The Persecutions of Annam</cite>.
For centuries Europeans have been excluded
from this country, into the interior
of which the only strangers who have
penetrated have been Catholic missionaries,
and they have gone at the risk of
their lives. For two hundred and fifty
years the apostles of the church have
been laboring in Annam, and whoever
will read this book will be struck with
wonder at the work they have done
and the sufferings they have endured.
Never anywhere have there been more
barbarous or cruel persecutions, and
never have they been borne with more
heroic fortitude and simple trust in God.</p>

<p>And then what a wealth of instruction
in the lives of these Annamite converts!
From 1615 down to our own day thousands
and hundreds of thousands have
received the faith, and, rather than forfeit
it, hundreds and thousands have endured
every torment, death itself. Their
warm piety, their intelligent faith, their
dauntless courage, put us to shame.</p>

<p>The last persecution broke out in
1858, and raged until the Christians were
relieved by the arms of France, in consequence
of which a treaty of peace was
signed in June, 1862, which was soon followed
by a decree granting religious
worship; and we may hope that the soil
which has drunk the blood of so many
martyrs will yet become the vineyard of
Christ.</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p><span class="smcap">The American State and American
Statesmen.</span> By William Giles Dix.
1 vol. 12mo, pp. 171. Boston: Estes
&amp; Lauriat. 1876.</p>

</div>

<p>It is refreshing in these days to meet
with a non-Catholic writer like Mr. Dix,
who takes his stand on Christianity and
the law of Christ as the foundation of
all right law and government. There is
a class, and a large class, of patriots
among us who seem, unconsciously indeed,
to resent the idea that Almighty
God had anything at all to do with the
growth and development of this country.
To this class of men Mr. Dix’s book will
be a sharp reminder that there is a God
above us who rules all things, and that
religion and governments did actually
exist in the world at large&mdash;and in the
New World, for the matter of that&mdash;before
the <i>Mayflower</i> touched these shores.
The book deals with just what its title
indicates: the American state and American
statesmen. Among the statesmen
dealt with are Abraham Lincoln, Charles
Sumner, and several of the historic names
that have lent a lustre to Congress. But
the larger and graver portion of the book
deals with the constitution of the States
in themselves and their relation to the
States as a whole or nation. Mr. Dix is
a strong and earnest advocate for his
views; but his views in the present matter
are almost diametrically opposed to
the general feeling of Americans. “Are
the United States a nation?” he boldly
asks in the final chapter of the book, and
his answer is “yes” and “no.” In a
word, he is strongly in favor of the centralization
of sovereignty as opposed to
the local independence of States. As
long as federalism exists, says Mr. Dix,
practically, so long is the nation exposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_720" id="Page_720">[720]</a></span>
to disorder and a renewal of the civil
war.</p>

<p>So important a question, it is needless
to remark, is scarcely to be settled in a
book-notice; is, indeed, beyond books
altogether. It is a growth. The country
and government alike are a growth,
and a growth that will not be forced.
They are just entering on the hundredth
year of a life that has been seriously
threatened, and, notwithstanding the
theatrical thunder which is being heard
just now of politicians resolved to make
“a hit,” we cannot but look to the development
of this growth with hope and
confidence. At the same time, it is the
part of all who are concerned to guard
that growth well, to see that no weeds
spring up around it, to let in light and
air and freedom, and to keep off all noxious
influences that would threaten the
life of the parent stem. In the desire to
do this, such chapters as “Christianity
the Inspirer of Nations,” “Materialism
the Curse of America,” and “America
a Christian Power,” which seem to us
the strongest chapters in Mr. Dix’s book,
will be found full of eloquent suggestion
and sound, even solemn, advice. The
book, as a whole, will be found a very
interesting one. The writer is a bold
man, who certainly has the courage of
his convictions, which he never hesitates
to express openly. The book overruns
with apt illustration and an extraordinary
eloquence. Indeed, there is a fault
in parts of too great eloquence, compensated
for over and over again by passages
full of terseness, purity, and
strength.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Personal Reminiscences by Constable
and Gillies.</span> (Bric-à-Brac Series.)
Edited by Richard Henry Stoddard.
New York: Scribner, Armstrong &amp;
Co. 1876.</p>

</div>

<p>This volume completes the first Bric-à-Brac
Series. The publishers announce
an extensive sale&mdash;proof only of its
being suited to certain literary tastes.
We have not been able to pronounce a
very favorable opinion upon the merits
of the series. In turning over the leaves
of a college sheet the other day, we came
upon an extract from the letter of a young
lady at one of our fashionable seminaries,
in which, counselling her sisters to high
resolves and noble aims, she says: “Instead
of getting a new hat this term,
let us buy a Bric-à-Brac.” We think
this is good evidence of the value
of these volumes as literary works.
They are admirably suited for boarding-school
misses. But what the authors
and scholars who are gossiped about
would say at being brought down to this
level is another question. On the whole,
we would advise this young lady to buy
a new hat instead. The hat will serve a
useful if not a very exalted purpose in
covering her head; the “Bric-à-Brac”
will fill it with frivolous and untrustworthy
chit-chat.</p>

<p>This volume treats, under distinct
heads, of forty-six persons&mdash;including a
majority of the poets, novelists, historians,
linguistic scholars, and essayists of
Scotland at the beginning of this century,
with a sprinkling of English and
German <i lang="fr">savants</i>, including Goethe&mdash;in a
little over three hundred small duodecimo
pages. That is to say, it gives an
average of seven pages to each author.
These seven pages are devoted almost
exclusively in each instance to trivial
personal anecdotes. From this simple
inventory, therefore, it will be easy to
form an accurate notion of what the
young lady gains mentally as an equivalent
for the loss of her new hat.</p>

<p>Considerable space is given, however,
to one or two worthies. Of these, William
Godwin, the revolutionary propagandist,
holds the first place, and with him incidentally
his first wife, Mary Wollstonecraft,
the author of the <cite>Vindication of the
Rights of Woman</cite>. This precious pair
are handled with great tenderness and
unction.</p>

<p>The rest of the volume is made up
chiefly of reminiscences of the small literary
stars who twinkled round Sir Walter
Scott in Edinburgh at the beginning of
the century, and stole something from the
reflection of his brightness, but who are
now for the most part forgotten.</p>

<p>Excellent stories, all of which might

<h3>A SEQUEL OF THE GLADSTONE CONTROVERSY.</h3>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>One of the most mischievous
prejudices of our day is the popular
theory that the cure for all evils
is to be sought in the intellectual
education of the masses. Those
nations, we are told by every declaimer,
in which the education of
the people is most universal, are
the most moral, the richest, the
strongest, the freest, and their prosperity
rests upon the most solid
and lasting foundation. Make ignorance
a crime, teach all to read
and write, and war will smooth its
rugged front, armies will be disbanded,
crime will disappear, and
mankind will have found the secret
of uninterrupted progress, the final
outcome of which will surpass even
our fondest dreams.</p>

<p>This fallacy, which has not even
the merit of being plausible, is, of
course, made to do service in M.
de Laveleye’s pamphlet on the
comparative bearing of Protestantism
and Catholicism on the prosperity
of nations.</p>

<p>“It is now universally admitted,”
he informs us (p. 22), “that
the diffusion of enlightenment is
the first condition of progress.…
The general spread of education
is also indispensable to the exercise
of constitutional liberty.… In
short, education is the basis of national
liberty and prosperity.”</p>

<p>He then goes on to declare that
in this matter of popular education
Protestant countries are far in advance
of those that are Catholic;
that this is necessarily so, since
“the Reformed religion rests on a
book&mdash;the Bible; the Protestant,
therefore, must know how to read.
Catholic worship, on the contrary,
rests upon sacraments and certain
practices&mdash;such as confession, Masses,
sermons&mdash;which do not necessarily
involve reading. It is, therefore,
unnecessary to know how to
read; indeed, it is dangerous, for
it inevitably shakes the principle
of passive obedience on which
the whole Catholic edifice reposes:
reading is the road that leads to
heresy.”</p>

<p>We will first consider the theory,
and then take up the facts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_722" id="Page_722">[722]</a></span></p>

<p>“The diffusion of enlightenment
is the first condition of progress.
Education is indispensable to the
exercise of constitutional liberty.
Education is the basis of national
liberty and prosperity.”</p>

<p>Enlightenment is, of course, of
the mind, and means the development,
more or less perfect, of the
intellectual faculties; and education,
since it is here considered as
synonymous with enlightenment,
must be taken in this narrow sense.</p>

<p>Progress is material, moral, intellectual,
social, political, artistic, religious,
scientific, literary, and indefinitely
manifold. Now, it is assumed
that the diffusion of enlightenment
is not merely promotive,
but that it is an essential condition
of progress in its widest and fullest
meaning. This is the new faith&mdash;the
goddess of culture, holding the
torch of science and leading mankind
into the palace of pleasure,
the only true heaven.</p>

<p>By conduct, we have already
said, both individuals and nations
are saved or perish; and we spoke
of the civilized. Barbarous states
are destroyed by catastrophes&mdash;they
die a violent death; but the
civilized are wasted by internal
maladies&mdash;<i lang="la">suis et ipsa Roma viribus
ruit</i>. They grow and they decay,
they progress and they decline.
At first poverty, virtue, industry,
faith, hopefulness, strong characters
and heroic natures; at last
wealth, corruption, indolence, unbelief,
despair, children too weak
even to admire the strength of
their fathers, too base to believe
that they were noble. Public
spirit dies out; patriotism is in the
mouths of politicians, but, like the
augurs of Rome, they cannot speak
the word and look one another in
the face. The country is to each
one what he can make out of it,
and the bond of union is the desire
of each citizen to secure his own
interests. The bondholders love
their country, and the <i lang="fr">sans-culottes</i>
are disloyal; class rises against
class, civil discord unsettles everything,
revolution succeeds revolution,
and when the barbarian comes
he holds an inquest over the corpse.
It generally happens, too, that those
civilizations which spring up quickest
and promise most fair are fated
to die earliest; as precocious children
disappoint fond mothers. If
the teaching of history is a trustworthy
guide, we are certainly safe
in affirming that civilized states
and empires perish, not from lack
of knowledge, but of virtue; not
because the people are ignorant,
but because they are corrupt.</p>

<p>The assumption, however, is
that men become immoral because
they are ignorant; that if they were
enlightened, they would be virtuous.</p>

<p>“The superstition,” says Herbert
Spencer (<cite>Study of Sociology</cite>,
p. 121), “that good behavior is to
be forthwith produced by lessons
learned out of books, which was
long ago statistically disproved,
would, but for preconceptions, be
utterly dissipated by observing to
what a slight extent knowledge affects
conduct; by observing that the
dishonesty implied in the adulterations
of tradesmen and manufacturers,
in fraudulent bankruptcies,
in bubble-companies, in ‘cooking’
of railway accounts and financial
prospectuses, differs only in form,
and not in amount, from the dishonesty
of the uneducated; by observing
how amazingly little the
teachings given to medical students
affect their lives, and how even the
most experienced medical men
have their prudence scarcely at all
increased by their information.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_723" id="Page_723">[723]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not knowledge, but character,
that is important; and character
is formed more by faith, by
hope, by love, admiration, enthusiasm,
reverence, than by any patchwork
of alphabetical and arithmetical
symbols. The young know but
little; but they believe firmly, they
hope nobly, and love generously;
and it is while knowledge is feeble
and these spontaneous acts of the
soul are strong that character is
moulded. The curse of our age is
that men will believe that, in education,
to spell, to read, to write, is
what signifies, and they cast aside
the eternal faith, the infinite hope,
the divine love, that more than all
else make us men.</p>

<p>“The true test of civilization,”
says Emerson, “is not the census,
nor the size of cities, nor the crops&mdash;no,
but the kind of man the country
turns out.” Is there some mystic
virtue in printed words that to
be able to read them should make
us men? And even in the most
enlightened countries what do the
masses of men know? Next to nothing;
and their reading, for the
most part, stupefies them. The
newspaper, with its murders, suicides,
hangings, startling disclosures,
defalcations, embezzlements, burglaries,
forgeries, adulteries, advertisements
of nostrums, quack medicines,
and secrets of working death
in the very source of life, with all
manner of hasty generalizations,
crude theories, and half-truths jumbled
into intellectual <i lang="fr">pot-pourris</i>;
the circulating library, with its
stories, tales, romances of love, despair,
death, of harrowing accidents,
of hair-breadth escapes, of
successful crime, and all the commonplaces
of wild, reckless, and
unnatural life&mdash;these are the sources
of their knowledge. Or, if they
are ambitious, they read “How to
get on in the world,” “The art of
making money,” “The secret of
growing rich,” “The road to wealth,”
“Successful men,” “The millionaires
of America,” and the Mammon-worship,
and the superstition
of matter, and the idolatry of success
become their religion; their
souls die within them, and what
wretched slaves they grow to be!</p>

<p>In the newspaper and circulating
library God and man, heaven and
earth&mdash;all things&mdash;are discussed,
flippantly, in snatches, generally; all
possible conflicting and contradictory
views are taken; and these ignorant
masses, who, in the common
schools, have been through the
Fourth Reader, and who know nothing,
not even their own ignorance,
are confused. They doubt, they lose
faith, and are enlightened by the
discovery that God, the soul, truth,
justice, honor, are only nominal&mdash;they
do not concern positivists.
Can anything be more pitiful than
the state of these poor wretches?&mdash;neither
knowing nor believing;
without knowledge, yet having neither
faith nor love. God pity them
that they are communists, internationalists,
<i lang="fr">solidaires</i>; for what else
could they be? No enthusiasm is
possible for them but that of destruction.</p>

<p>Religion is the chief element in
civilization, and consequently in
progress. For the masses of men,
even though the whole energy of
mankind should spend itself upon
some or any possible common-school
system, the eternal principles
which mould character, support
manhood, and consecrate humanity
will always remain of faith,
and can never be held scientifically.
If it were possible that science
should prove religion false, it would
none the less remain true, or there
would be no truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_724" id="Page_724">[724]</a></span></p>

<p>What children know when they
leave school is mechanical, external
to their minds, fitted on them
like clothes on the body; and it is
soon worn threadbare, and hangs
in shreds and patches. Take the
first boy whom you meet, fourteen
or fifteen years old, fresh from the
common school, and his ignorance
of all real knowledge will surprise
you. What he knows is little and
of small value; what is of moment
is whether he believes firmly, hopes
strongly, and loves truly. Not the
diffusion of enlightenment do we
want so much, but the diffusion of
character, of honest faith, and manly
courage.</p>

<p>Man is more than his knowledge.
Simple faith is better than reading
and writing. And yet the educational
quacks treat the child as
though he were mere mind, and
his sole business to use it, and
chiefly for low ends, shrewdly and
sharply, with a view to profit; as
though life were a thing of barter,
and wisdom the art of making the
most of it.</p>

<p>Poor child! who wouldst live
by admiration, hope, and love, how
they dwarf thy being, stunt thy
growth, and flatten all thy soaring
thoughts with their dull commonplaces&mdash;thrift,
honesty is the best
policy, time is money, knowledge
is wealth, and all the vocabulary of
a shop-keeping and trading philosophy.
Poor child! who wouldst
look out into the universe as God’s
great temple, and behold in all its
glories the effulgence of heaven; to
whom morning, noon, and night,
and change of season, golden flood
of day and star-lit gloom, all
speak of some diviner life, how
they stun thy poetic soul, full of
high dreams and noble purposes,
with their cold teaching that man
lives on bread alone&mdash;put money
in thy purse! And when thou
wouldst look back with awe and
reverence to the sacred ages past,
to the heroes, sages, saints of the
olden times, they come with their
gabble and tell thee there were no
railroads and common schools in
those days.</p>

<p>Is it strange that this education
should hurt the nation’s highest
interests by driving in crowds, like
cattle to the shambles, our youths
from God and nature and tilling
of the soil to town and city, or,
worse, into professions to which
only their conceit or distaste for hard
labor calls them? What place for
morality is there in this Poor Richard’s
Catechism&mdash;education of thrift
and best policy? We grow in likeness
to what we love, not to what
we know. With low aims and
selfish loves only narrow and imperfect
characters are compatible.</p>

<p>Science, when cherished for itself&mdash;which
it seldom is and in very
exceptional cases&mdash;refines and purifies
its lovers, and chastens the
force of passion; though even here
we must admit that the wisest
of mankind may be the meanest,
morally the most unworthy. But
for the great mass of men, even of
those who are called educated, the
possession of such knowledge as
they have or can have has no necessary
relation with higher moral
life. Their learning may refine,
smooth over, or conceal their sin;
it will not destroy it. The furred
gown and intertissued robe hide
the faults that peep through beggars’
rags, but they are there all the
same. There may be a substitution
of pride for sensuality, or a
skilful blending or alternation of
the finer with the coarser. Vice
may lose its grossness, but not its
evil. And herein we detect the
wretched sophistry of criminal statistics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_725" id="Page_725">[725]</a></span>
which deal, imperfectly and
roughly enough, with what is open,
shocking, and repulsive. The hidden
sins that “like pitted speck in
garnered fruit,” slowly eating to the
core of a people’s life, moulder all;
the sapping of faith, the weakening
of character, the disbelief in goodness;
the luxury, the indulgence, the
heartlessness and narrowness of the
rich; the cunning devices through
which “the spirit of murder”
works in the very means of life,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">“While rank corruption, mining all within,</div>
<div class="verse">Infects unseen”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;cannot be appreciated by the
gross tests of numbers and averages.
The poor, by statistics as by the
world, are handled without gloves.
In the large cities of civilized countries,
both in ancient and in modern
times, we have unmistakable proof
of what knowledge can do to form
character and produce even the
social virtues. These populations
have had the advantage of the best
schools in the most favorable circumstances,
and yet in character
and morality they are far beneath
the less educated peasantry. Sensual
indulgence, contempt of authority,
hatred and jealousy of those
above them, make these the dangerous
classes, eager for socialistic
reforms, radical upheavals of the
whole existing order; and were it
not for the more religious tillers of
the soil, chaos and misrule would
already prevail. In Greece and
Rome it was in the cities that civilization
first perished, as it was
there it began&mdash;began with men
who had great faith and strong
character, but little knowledge;
perished among men who were
learned and refined, but who in
indulgence and debauch had lost
all strength and honesty of purpose.</p>

<p>In the last report of the Commissioner
of Education some interesting
facts, bearing on the relation
of ignorance to crime, are taken
from the Forty-fifth Annual Report
of the inspector of the State penitentiary
for the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>“It is doubted if in any State, or
indeed in any country,” says the
commissioner, “forty-four volumes
containing the annual statistical tables
relating to the populations of
a penal institution, covering nearly
half a century, can, on examination,
be regarded as more complete.”</p>

<p>The number of prisoners received
into the institution from 1850 to
1860 was 1,605, of whom 15 per
cent. were illiterate, 15 per cent.
were able to read, and 70 per cent.,
or more than two-thirds, knew how
to read and write; from 1860 to
1870, 2,383 prisoners were received
into the penitentiary, and of these
17 per cent. were illiterate, 12 per
cent. could read, and about 71 per
cent. could read and write.</p>

<p>Of the 627 convicts who were in
the penitentiary during the year
1867, 62 per cent., or five-eighths
of the whole number, had attended
the public schools of the State,
25 per cent., or two-eighths, had
gone to private institutions, and 12
per cent., or one-eighth, had never
gone to school.</p>

<p>But, as we have said, statistics
deal with crime, and chiefly with
the more open and discoverable
sort, not with morality; whereas
nations are destroyed not so much
by crime as by immorality.</p>

<p>The thief is caught and sent to
the penitentiary; but the trader
who adulterates or gives short
measure, the banker who puts forth
a false or exaggerated statement,
the merchant who fails with full
hands, the stock-gambler who robs
thousands, Crédit-Mobilier men and
“ring” men generally who plunder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_726" id="Page_726">[726]</a></span>
scientifically, Congressmen who take
money for helping to swindle the
government, getters-up of “bubble
companies”&mdash;salted diamond-fields
and Emma Mines&mdash;compared with
whom pickpockets and burglars
are respectable gentlemen&mdash;these
know not of penitentiaries; prisons
were not built for such as they.
The poor man abandons his wife,
without divorce marries another, and
is very properly sent to State prison.
His rich and educated fellow-citizen
gets a divorce, or is a free-lover,
or keeps a harem, and for him laws
were not made. Even that respectable
old dame Society only gently
shakes her head. We must not expect
too much of gentlemen, you
know. The ignorant girl falls,
commits infanticide, and is incarcerated
or hanged&mdash;heaven forbid that
we should attempt to tell what she
would have done had she been educated!&mdash;at
any rate, she would not
have gone to prison, though her
guilt would not have been less.</p>

<p>Has the very great diffusion of
enlightenment among our people
during the hundred years that we
have been an independent nation
made them more moral and more
worthy?</p>

<p>“The true test of civilization is
not the census, nor the size of cities,
nor the crops&mdash;no, but the kind
of man the country turns out.”</p>

<p>The Yankee is smarter than the
Puritan&mdash;is he as true a man? Is
the inventor of a sewing-machine
or a patent bedstead as worthy as
he who believes in God and in liberty
against the whole earth with
all his heart and soul, even though
the heart be hard and the soul narrow?
What compensation is there
in all our philanthropies, transcendentalisms,
sentimentalities, patent
remedies for social evils, for the
loss of the strong convictions, reverent
belief, and simple dignity of
character that made our fathers
men? Do we believe in the goodness
and honesty of men as they
did, or is it possible that we should?
What can come of beliefs in oversouls,
whims, tendencies, abstractions,
developments? If we were
shadows in a shadow-land, this might
do.</p>

<p>Look at a famous trial where
the very aroma and fine essence
of our civilization was gathered:
What bright minds, keen intellects!
Poetry, eloquence, romance; the
culture, the knowledge, the scientific
theories, of the age&mdash;all are there.
And yet, when the veil is lifted, we
simply turn away heart sick and
nauseated. Not a hundred statistical
prison reports would reveal
the festering corruption and deep
depravity, the coarse vulgarity and
utter heartlessness that is there,
whatever the truth may be, if in
such surroundings it can be found
at all.</p>

<p>In Laing’s <cite>Notes of a Traveller</cite>
(p. 221) we find a most striking example
of almost incredible corruption
united with great intellectual
culture. “In this way,” he says,
“we must account for the singular
fact that the only positively immoral
religious sect of the present
times in the Christian world arose
and has spread itself in the most
educated part of the most educated
country in Europe&mdash;in and about
Königsberg, the capital of the province
of Old Prussia. The Muckers
are a sect who combine lewdness
with religion. The conventicles
of this sect are frequented by
men and women in a state of nudity;
and to excite the animal passion,
but to restrain its indulgence,
is said to constitute their religious
exercise. Many of the highest nobility
of the province, and two of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_727" id="Page_727">[727]</a></span>
the established clergy of the city,
besides citizens, artificers, and ladies,
old and young, belong to this
sect; and two young ladies are
stated to have died from the consequences
of excessive libidinous excitement.
It is no secret association
of profligacy shunning the
light. It is a sect&mdash;according to
the declarations of Von Tippelskirch
and of several persons of
consideration in Königsberg who
had been followers of it themselves&mdash;existing
very extensively
under the leadership of the established
ministers of the Gospel, Ebel
and Diestel, of a Count von Kaniz,
of a Lady von S&mdash;&mdash;, and of other
noble persons.… The system
and theory of this dreadful combination
of vice with religion are, of
course, very properly suppressed.…
The sect itself appears, by Dr.
Bretscheider’s account of it, to
have been so generally diffused
that he says ‘it cannot be believed
that the public functionaries
were in ignorance of its existence;
but they were afraid to do their
duty from the influence of the
many principal people who were involved
in it.’”</p>

<p>But we are not the advocates of
ignorance. We will praise with
any man the true worth and inestimable
value of education. Even
mere mental training is, to our
thinking, of rare price. Water is
good, but without bread it will not
sustain life. Wine warms and gladdens
the heart of man; but if used
without care, it maddens and drives
to destruction. We are crying out
against the folly of the age which
would make the school-room its
church, education its sacrament,
and culture its religion. It is the
road to ruin. Culture is for the
few; and what a trumpery patchwork
of frippery and finery and
paste diamonds it must ever remain
for the most of these! For
the millions it means the pagan
debauch, the bacchanal orgy, and
mere animalism.</p>

<p>“The characters,” wrote Goethe&mdash;who
was pagan of the pagans and
“decidirter Nicht-Christ”&mdash;“which
we can truly respect have become
rarer. We can sincerely esteem
only that which is not self-seeking.…
I must confess to have found
through my whole life unselfish
characters of the kind of which I
speak only there where I found a
firmly-grounded religious life; a
creed, which had an unchangeable
basis, resting upon itself&mdash;not dependent
upon the time, its spirit, or
its science.”</p>

<p>This foundation of a positive
religious faith is as indispensable
to national as to individual character,
and without it the diffusion
of enlightenment cannot create a
great or lasting civilization. Religion
ought to constitute the very
essence of all primary education.
It alone can touch the heart, raise
the mind, and evoke from their
brutish apathy the elements of
humanity, especially the reason;
and it is therefore the one indispensable
element in any right
system of national education. A
population unable to read or
write, but with a religious faith
and discipline, has before now constituted,
and may again constitute,
a great nation; but a people without
religious earnestness has no
solid political character. Religion
is the widest and deepest of all
the elements of civilization; it
reaches those whom nothing else
can touch; but for the masses of
men there can be no religion without
the authoritative teaching of a
church.</p>

<p>And now let us return to M. de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_728" id="Page_728">[728]</a></span>
Laveleye. “The general spread
of education,” he says (p. 23), “is
indispensable to the exercise of constitutional
liberty.… Education
is the basis of national
liberty and prosperity.”</p>

<p>In view of the facts that constitutional
liberty has existed, and
for centuries, in states in which
there was no “general spread of
education,” and that “the diffusion
of enlightenment” is found in our
own day to co-exist with the most
hateful despotisms, we might pass
on, without stopping to examine
more closely these loose and popular
phrases; but since the fallacies
which they contain form a part of
the culture-creed of modern paganism,
and are accepted as indisputable
truths by the multitude, they
have a claim upon our attention
which their assertion by Mr. Gladstone’s
friend could not give them.</p>

<p>There is no necessary connection
between popular education
and civil liberty, as there is none
between the enlightenment and the
morality of a people. This is a
subject full of import&mdash;one which,
in this age and country, ought to
be discussed with perfect freedom
and courage. Courage indeed is
needed precisely here; for to deny
that there is a God, to treat Christ
as a myth or a common man, to declaim
against religion as superstition,
to make the Bible a butt for
witticisms and fine points, to deny
future life and the soul’s immortality,
to denounce marriage, to
preach communism, and to ridicule
whatever things mankind have
hitherto held sacred&mdash;this is not
only tolerable, it is praiseworthy
and runs with the free thought of
an enlightened and inquiring age.
But to raise a doubt as to the supreme
and paramount value of intellectual
training; of its sovereign
efficacy in the cure of human ills;
of its inseparable alliance with freedom,
with progress, with man’s
best interests, is pernicious heresy,
and ought not to be borne with
patiently. In our civilization,
through the action of majorities,
there is special difficulty in such
discussions, since with us nothing
is true except what is popular.
Majorities rule, and are therefore
right. With rare eloquence we denounce
tyrant kings and turn to
lick the hands of the tyrant people.
Whoever questions the wisdom
of the American people is not to
be argued with&mdash;he is to be pitied;
and therefore both press and pulpit,
though they flaunt the banner
of freedom, are the servants of the
tyrant. To have no principles,
but to write and speak what will
please the most and offend the fewest&mdash;this
is the philosophy of free
speech. We therefore have no
independent, and consequently no
great, thinkers. It is dangerous not
to think with majorities and parties;
for those who attempt to
break their bonds generally succeed,
like Emerson, only in becoming
whimsical, weak, and inconclusive.
It is not surprising, then,
that the Catholics, because they do
not accept as true or ultimate what
is supposed to be the final thought
and definite will of American majorities
on the subject of education,
should be denounced, threatened,
and made a Trojan Horse of
to carry political adventurers into
the White House.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the observant are
losing confidence in the theory, so
full of inspiration to demagogues
and declaimers, that superstition
and despotism must be founded on
ignorance. In Prussia at this moment
universal education co-exists
with despotism. Where tyrannical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_729" id="Page_729">[729]</a></span>
governments take control of education
they easily make it their
ally.</p>

<p>Let us hear what Laing says of
the practical results of the Prussian
system of education, which it is so
much the fashion to praise.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If the ultimate object,” he says, “of
all education and knowledge be to raise
man to the feeling of his own moral
worth, to a sense of his responsibility
to his Creator and to his conscience for
every act, to the dignity of a reflecting,
self-guiding, virtuous, religious member
of society, then the Prussian educational
system is a failure. It is only a training
from childhood in the conventional
discipline and submission of mind which
the state exacts from its subjects. It is
not a training or education which has
raised, but which has lowered, the human
character.… The social value or importance
of the Prussian arrangements for
diffusing national scholastic education
has been evidently overrated; for now
that the whole system has been in the
fullest operation in society upon a whole
generation, we see morals and religion
in a more unsatisfactory state in this very
country than in almost any other in the
north of Europe; we see nowhere a
people in a more abject political and
civil condition, or with less free agency
in their social economy. A national education
which gives a nation neither religion,
nor morality, nor civil liberty, nor
political liberty is an education not worth
having.… If to read, write, cipher,
and sing be education, the Prussian
subject is an educated man. If to reason,
judge, and act as an independent
free agent, in the religious, moral, and
social relations of man to his Creator
and to his fellow-men, be the exercise of
the mental powers which alone deserves
the name of education, then is the Prussian
subject a mere drum boy in education,
in the cultivation and use of all
that regards the moral and intellectual
endowments of man, compared to one
of the unlettered population of a free
country. The dormant state of the public
mind on all affairs of public interest,
the acquiescence in a total want of political
influence or existence, the intellectual
dependence upon the government
or its functionary in all the affairs
of the community, the abject submission
to the want of freedom or free agency in
thoughts, words, or acts, the religious
thraldom of the people to forms which
they despise, the want of influence of religious
and social principle in society,
justify the conclusion that the moral, religious,
and social condition of the people
was never looked at or estimated by
those writers who were so enthusiastic
in their praises of the national education
of Prussia.”</p>

</div>

<p>In spite of the continued progress
of education, there is even
less liberty, religious, civil, and political,
in Prussia to-day than when
these words were written, thirty
years ago.</p>

<p>Nothing more dazzles the eyes
of men than great military success;
and this, together with the habit
which belongs to our race of applauding
whoever wins, has produced,
especially in England and the
United States, where Bismarck is
looked upon, ignorantly enough, as
the champion of Protestantism, a
kind of blind admiration and awe
for whatever is Prussian. “Protestant
Prussia,” boasts M. de Laveleye,
“has defeated two empires,
each containing twice her own population,
the one in seven weeks, the
other in seven months”; and in the
new edition of Appleton’s <cite>Encyclopædia</cite>
we are informed that these
victories are attributed to the superior
education of her people. As
well might the tyranny of the government
and the notorious unchastity
and dishonesty of the Prussians
be ascribed to their superior education.
Not to the general intelligence
of the people, but to the fact
that the whole country has been
turned into a military camp, and
that to the one purpose of war all
interests have been made subservient,
must we seek for an explanation
of the victories of Sadowa
and Sedan.</p>

<p>Who would pretend that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_730" id="Page_730">[730]</a></span>
Spartans were in war superior to
the Athenians because they had a
more perfect system of education
and were more intelligent or had a
truer religion? Or who would
think of accounting in this way for
the marvellous exploits of Attila
with his Huns, of Zingis Khan with
his Moguls, of Tamerlane with his
Tartars, of Mahmood, Togrul-Beg,
and Malek-Shah with their Turkish
hordes?</p>

<p>In fact, it may be said, speaking
largely and in general, that the history
of war is that of the triumph
of strong and ignorant races over
those which have become cultivated,
refined, and corrupt. The
Romans learned from their conquered
slaves letters and the vices
of a more polished paganism. Barbarism
is ever impending over the
civilized world. The wild and
rugged north is ever rushing down
upon the soft and cultured south:
the Scythian upon the Mede, the
Persian, and the Egyptian; the Macedonian
upon Greece, and then
upon Asia and Africa; the Roman
upon Carthage, and in turn falling
before the men of the North&mdash;Goth,
Vandal, Hun, Frank, and Gaul; the
Mogul and the Tartar upon China
and India; the Turk upon Southern
Europe, Asia, and Africa; and
to-day, like black clouds of destiny,
the Russian hordes hang over the
troubled governments of more educated
Europe. Look at Italy during
the middle ages&mdash;the focus of
learning and the arts for all Christendom,
and yet an easy prey for
every barbarous adventurer; and in
England the Briton yields to the
Saxon, who in turn falls before the
Norman. It would be truer to say
that Prussia owes her military successes
to the ignorance of her people,
though they nearly all can read and
write. Had she had to deal with
intelligent, enlightened, and thinking
populations, she could not have
made the country a camp of soldiers.</p>

<p>The Prussian policy of “blood
and iron” has been carried out, in
defiance of the wishes of the people
as expressed through their representatives,
who were snubbed and
scolded and sent back home as
though they were a pack of schoolboys;
yet the people looked on
in stolid indifference, and allowed
the tax to be levied after they had
refused to grant it.</p>

<p>We will now follow M. de Laveleye
a step farther.</p>

<p>“With regard to elementary instruction,”
he says, “the Protestant
states are incomparably more advanced
than the Catholic. England
alone is no more than on a
level with the latter, probably because
the Anglican Church, of all
the reformed forms of worship, has
most in common with the Church
of Rome.”</p>

<p>If any one has good reason to
praise education, and above all the
education of the people, certainly
we Catholics have. The Catholic
Church created the people; she
first preached the divine doctrine
of the brotherhood and equality of
all men before God, which has
wrought and must continue to work
upon society until all men shall be
recognized as equals by the law.
She drew around woman her magic
circle; from the slave struck his
fetters and bade him be a man;
lifted to her bosom the child; baptized
all humanity into the inviolable
sacredness of Christ’s divinity;
she appealed, and still appeals, from
the tyranny of brute force and success,
in the name of the eternal liberties
of the soul, to God. Her
martyrs were and are the martyrs
of liberty; and if she were not to-day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_731" id="Page_731">[731]</a></span>
all men would accept accomplished
facts and bow before whatever
succeeds.</p>

<p>The barbarians, who have developed
into the civilized peoples of
Europe, despised learning as they
contemned labor. War was their
business. The knight signed his
name with his sword, in blood; the
pen, like the spade, was made for servile
hands. To destroy this ignorant,
idle life of pillage and feud, the
church organized an army, unlike
any the world had ever seen, unlike
any it will ever see outside her
pale&mdash;an army of monks, who, with
faith in Christ and the higher life,
believed in knowledge and in work.
They became the cultivators of the
mind and soil of Europe.</p>

<p>“The praise,” says Hallam,
speaking of the middle ages, “of
having originally established schools
belongs to some bishops and abbots
of the VIth century.”</p>

<p>Ireland is converted and at once
becomes a kind of university for all
Europe. In England the episcopal
sees became centres of learning.
Wherever a cathedral was built a
school with a library grew up under
its shadow. Pope Eugenius II., in
a council held in Rome in 826, ordered
that schools should be established
throughout Christendom at
cathedral and parochial churches
and other suitable places. The Council
of Mayence, in 813, admonishes
parents that they are in duty bound to
send their children to school. The
Synod of Orleans, in 800, enjoins
the erection in towns and villages
of schools for elementary instruction,
and adds that no remuneration
shall be received except such
as the parents voluntarily offer.
The Third General Council of
Lateran, in 1179, commanded that
in all cathedral churches a fund
should be set aside for the foundation
and support of schools for the
poor. Free schools were thus first
established by the Catholic Church.
The monasteries were the libraries
where the arts and letters of a civilization
that had perished were
carefully treasured up for the rekindling
of a brighter and better
day.</p>

<p>As early as the XIIth century
many of the universities of Europe
were fully organized. Italy took
the lead, with universities at Rome
Bologna, Padua, Naples, Pavia, and
Perugia&mdash;the sources</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Whence many rivulets have since been turned,</div>
<div class="verse">O’er the garden Catholic to lead</div>
<div class="verse">Their living waters, and have fed its plants.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The schools founded at Oxford
and Cambridge in the IXth and
Xth centuries had in the XIIth
grown to be universities. At Oxford
there were thirty thousand, at
Paris twenty-five thousand, and at
Padua twenty thousand students.
Scattered over Europe at the time
Luther raised his voice against the
church were sixty six universities.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Time went on,” says Dr. Newman,
speaking of the mediæval universities;
“a new state of things, intellectual and
social, came in; the church was girt with
temporal power; the preachers of S.
Dominic were in the ascendant: now, at
length, we may ask with curious interest,
did the church alter her ancient rule of
action, and proscribe intellectual activity?
Just the contrary; this is the very age of
universities; it is the classical period
of the schoolmen; it is the splendid and
palmary instance of the wise policy and
large liberality of the church, as regards
philosophical inquiry. If there ever was
a time when the intellect went wild, and
had a licentious revel, it was at the date
I speak of. When was there ever a more
curious, more meddling, bolder, keener,
more penetrating, more rationalistic exercise
of the reason than at that time?
What class of questions did that subtle
metaphysical spirit not scrutinize? What
premise was allowed without examination?
What principle was not traced to
its first origin, and exhibited in its most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_732" id="Page_732">[732]</a></span>
naked shape?… Well, I repeat, here
was something which came somewhat
nearer to theology than physical research
comes; Aristotle was a somewhat more
serious foe then, beyond all mistake, than
Bacon has been since. Did the church
take a high hand with philosophy then?
No, not though that philosophy was metaphysical.
It was a time when she had
temporal power, and could have exterminated
the spirit of inquiry with fire and
sword; but she determined to put it
down by <em>argument</em>; she said: ‘Two can
play at that, and my argument is the better.’
She sent her controversialists into
the philosophical arena. It was the Dominican
and Franciscan doctors, the
greatest of them being S. Thomas, who
in those mediæval universities fought the
battle of revelation with the weapons of
heathenism.”<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

</div>

<p>To find fault with the church
because popular education in the
middle ages was not organized and
general as it has since become
would be as wise as to pick a quarrel
with the ancient Greeks for not
having railroads, or with the Romans
because they had no steamships.
Reading and writing were
not taught then universally as they
are now because it was physically
and morally impossible that they
should have been. Without steam
and the printing-press, common-school
systems would not now be
practicable, nor would the want of
them be felt. We have great reason
to be thankful that the art of printing
was invented and America discovered
before Luther burned the
Pope’s bull, else we should be continually
bothered with refuting the
cause-and-effect historians who
would have infallibly traced both
these events to the Wittenberg conflagration.</p>

<p>All Europe was still Catholic
when gunpowder drove old Father
Schwarz’s pestle through the ceiling,
when Gutenberg made his
printing-press, when Columbus
landed in the New World; and
these are the forces which have
battered down the castles of feudalism,
have brought knowledge
within the reach of all, and some
measure of redress to the masses
of the Old World, by affording
them the possibility and opportunity
of liberty in the New. These
forces would have wrought to even
better purpose had Protestantism
not broken the continuity and
homogeneity of Christian civilization.
The Turk would not rest
like a blight from heaven upon
the fairest lands of Europe and
Asia, nor the darkness of heathenism
upon India and China, had
the civilized nations remained of
one faith; and thus, though our
own train might have rushed less
rapidly down the ringing grooves
of change, the whole human race
would have advanced to a level
which there now seems but little
reason to hope it will ever reach.</p>

<p>But to come more nearly to M.
de Laveleye’s assertion that the
Protestant states are incomparably
more advanced than the Catholic,
with the exception of England,
which in this matter is at
least up to the standard of Catholic
countries. In the report of
the Commissioner of Education for
1874 there is a statistical account
of the state of education in foreign
countries which throws some
light upon this subject.</p>

<p>The school attendance, compared
with the population, is in Austria as
1 to 10; in Belgium, as 1 to 10½;
in Ireland, as 1 to 16; in Catholic
Switzerland, as 1 to 16; in England,
as 1 to 17. In Bavaria it is
as 1 to 7, upon the authority of
Kay, in his <cite>Social Condition of the
People in England and Europe</cite>.
Catholic Austria, Bavaria, Belgium,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_733" id="Page_733">[733]</a></span>
and Ireland have proportionately a
larger school attendance than Protestant
England. England and
Wales (report of 1874), with a
population of 22,712,266, had a
school population of 5,374,700, of
whom only about half were registered,
and not half of these attended
with sufficient regularity
to bring grants to their schools.
Ireland, with a population of
5,411,416, had on register 1,006,511,
or nearly half as many as England
and Wales, though her population
is not a fourth of that of these two
countries. “The statistical fact,”
says Laing, speaking of Rome as it
was under the popes, “that Rome
has above a hundred schools more
than Berlin, for a population little
more than half that of Berlin, puts
to flight a world of humbug about
systems of national education carried
on by governments and their
moral effects on society.… In
Catholic Germany, in France, Italy,
and even Spain, the education of
the common people in reading,
writing, arithmetic, music, manners,
and morals, is at least as generally
diffused and as faithfully promoted
by the clerical body as in Scotland.
It is by their own advance, and not
by keeping back the advance of the
people, that the popish (<i lang="la">sic</i>) priesthood
of the present day seek to
keep ahead of the intellectual progress
of the community in Catholic
lands; and they might, perhaps, retort
on our Presbyterian clergy,
and ask if they, too, are in their
countries at the head of the intellectual
movement of the age. Education
is in reality not only not repressed,
but is encouraged, by the
popish church, and is a mighty instrument
in its hands, and ably
used.”<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>Professor Huxley’s testimony is
confirmatory of this admission of
Laing. “It was my fortune,” he says,
“some time ago to pay a visit to
one of the most important of the
institutions in which the clergy of
the Roman Catholic Church in these
islands are trained; and it seemed
to me that the difference between
these men and the comfortable
champions of Anglicanism and Dissent
was comparable to the difference
between our gallant Volunteers
and the trained veterans of
Napoleon’s Old Guard. The Catholic
priest is trained to know his
business and do it effectually. The
professors of the college in question,
learned, zealous, and determined
men, permitted me to speak
frankly with them. We talked like
outposts of opposed armies during
a truce&mdash;as friendly enemies; and
when I ventured to point out the
difficulties their students would
have to encounter from scientific
thought, they replied: ‘Our church
has lasted many ages, and has passed
safely through many storms.
The present is but a new gust of
the old tempest; and we do not
turn out our young men less fitted
to weather it than they have been
in former times to cope with the
difficulties of those times.’”<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p>“It is a common remark,” says
Kay, “of the operatives of Lancashire,
and one which is only too
true: ‘Your church is a church for
the rich, but not for the poor. It
was not intended for such people
as we are.’ The Roman church is
much wiser than the English in this
respect.… It is singular to observe
how the priests of Romanist
(<i lang="la">sic</i>) countries abroad associate
with the poor. I have often seen
them riding with the peasants in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_734" id="Page_734">[734]</a></span>
their carts along the roads, eating
with them in their houses, sitting
with them in the village inns, mingling
with them in their village festivals,
and yet always preserving
their authority.”<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>With us, too, the masses of the
people are fast abandoning Protestantism.
There is no Catholic
country in Europe in which the social
condition of the masses is so
wretched as in England, the representative
Protestant country. For
three hundred years, it may be said,
the Catholic Church had no existence
there. The nation was exclusively
under Protestant influence;
and yet the lower classes were suffered
to remain in stolid ignorance,
until they became the most degraded
population in Christendom.</p>

<p>“It has been calculated,” says
Kay, writing in 1850, “that there
are at the present day, in England
and Wales, nearly 8,000,000 persons
who cannot read and write.” That
was more than half of the whole
population at that time. But this
is not the worst. A population
ignorant of reading and writing may
nevertheless, to a certain extent, be
educated through religious teaching
and influence; but these unhappy
creatures were left, helpless and
hopeless, to sink deeper and deeper
beneath the weight of their degradation,
without being brought into contact
with any power that could refine
or elevate them; and if their condition
has somewhat improved in the
last quarter of a century, this is no
more to be attributed to Protestantism
than the Catholic Emancipation
Act or the Atlantic cable.</p>

<h3>ARE YOU MY WIFE?</h3>

<p class="center">BY THE AUTHOR OF “PARIS BEFORE THE WAR,” “NUMBER THIRTEEN,” “PIUS VI.,” ETC.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SEARCH NEARLY OVER.</span></h4>

<p>It was one of those exquisitely
lovely mornings that we sometimes
see in early spring. The night had
been frosty, and had hurried to
meet the dawn, leaving her moonlight
mantle behind her, frozen to
silver, on every field or hill-side.
The sky was of a heavenly blue&mdash;liquid
turquoise, swept with feathery
dashes of pink, that set off
the glistening landscape like a velvet
curtain spread for the purpose.
The sun was shining through a
pearly mist that hung, a silver
gauze veil, in the air and made
everything look dreamy and vision-like.
The meadows were silvered
with frost; so were the hedges&mdash;every
twig and thorn finished like
a jewel. The trees stood up like
immense bouquets of filigree against
the pink and blue curtain. No
wonder Franceline, who had been
awake and watching the sunrise
from her window, stole a march on
Angélique, and hastened out to
enjoy the beauty of the morning.
It was impossible it could hurt her;
it was too lovely to be unkind. But
besides this outward incentive,
there was another one that impelled
her to the daring escapade.
She felt an irresistible longing to
go to church this morning&mdash;one of
those longings that she called presentiments,
and seldom rejected
without having reason to regret it.
It was not that she was uneasy, or
alarmed, or unhappy about anything.
Nothing had occurred to
awake the dormant fires that were
still smouldering&mdash;though she
thought them dead&mdash;and impel her
to seek for strength in a threatened
renewal of the combat. Sir Simon’s
disappearance the morning after
the dinner-party, some few days
ago, had not surprised her; that
was his way, and this time she had
been prepared for it. It was true
that ever since then her father had
been more preoccupied, more inseparable
from his work. It was a
perfect mania with him for the last
three or four days. He scarcely let
the pen out of his hand from morning
till night. He seemed, moreover,
to have got to a point where he
could no longer use her as an
amanuensis, but must write himself.
Franceline was distressed at the
change; it deprived her of the
pleasure of helping him and of their
daily walk together, which had of
late become the principal enjoyment
of her life. But he could not
be persuaded to go beyond the garden
gate, and then only for ten
minutes to take a breath of air.
He was in a hurry to get back to
his study, as if the minutes were so
much gold wasted. Franceline was
obliged to accept this sudden alteration
in his habits, with the assurance
that it would not be for long;
that the great work was drawing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_736" id="Page_736">[736]</a></span>
a close; and that, when it was finished,
he would be free to walk with
her as much as she liked, and in
more beautiful places than Dullerton.
This last she did not believe.
No place could ever be so beautiful
as this familiar one, because
none would ever be hallowed by
the same sweet early memories, or
sanctified by the same sufferings
and regrets. There was a spirit
brooding over these quiet sylvan
slopes that could never dwell, for
her, elsewhere. She looked around
her at the leafless woods that lay
white and silent in the near distance,
and at the river winding
slowly towards them like an azure
arm encircling the silver fields, and
she sighed at the thought of ever
leaving them. The sigh escaped
from her lips in a little column of
sapphire smoke; for the air was as
clear as crystal, but it was cold too,
and the bell was already ringing;
so she drew her shawl closer and
hurried on. What was that fly doing
before the presbytery door?
Who could have business with Father
Henwick at such an unearthly
hour as seven <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>? When people
live in a small place where everybody’s
life is a routine as well
known as their own to everybody
else, the smallest trifle out of the
usual way is magnified into an
event. Franceline was not very
curious by nature; she passed the
mysterious fly with a momentary
glance of interest, and then dismissed
it from her thoughts. The
little white-washed church was
never full on week-days, its congregation
being mostly of the class
who can only afford the luxury of
going to church on Sundays. A
few kindly glances greeted her as
she walked up to her place near the
sanctuary. Since her health had
become delicate, it was a rare occurrence
to see her there during the
week, so her presence was looked
on as of good omen. She answered
the welcoming eyes with a sweet,
grateful smile, and then knelt down
and soon forgot them.</p>

<p>We talk of magnetic atmospheres
where instinct warns us of a presence
without any indication from
our senses. I don’t know whether
Franceline believed in such influences;
but her attitude of rapt devotion
as she knelt before the altar,
seemingly unconscious of anything
earthly near her, her soul drawn
upwards through her eyes and fixed
on the Unseen, did not suggest
that there was any human presence
within reach which had power
to move her. When Father Henwick
had left the altar, she rose
and went to the sacristy door to
ask if she could see him. She
wanted to speak to him about a
poor woman in the village. It was
not the clerk, but Father Henwick
himself, who came to answer her
message. He did not welcome his
young penitent in his usual gracious,
affectionate manner, but asked
sharply “who gave her leave to
be out at that hour?”</p>

<p>“The morning was so sunny I
thought it would do me no harm to
come,” replied the culprit, with a
sudden sense of having done something
very wicked.</p>

<p>“You had no business to think
about it at all; you should not
have come without your father’s
permission. Go home as fast as
you can.”</p>

<p>Franceline was turning away,
when he called her back.</p>

<p>“Come this way; you can go
out through the house.” Then he
added in a mollified tone: “You
foolish child! I hope you are
warmly clad? Keep your chest
well covered, and hold your muff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_737" id="Page_737">[737]</a></span>
up to your mouth. Be off, now, as
quick as you can, and let me have
no more of these tricks!”</p>

<p>He shook hands with her, half-smiling,
half-frowning, and, opening
the sacristy door that led into
the presbytery, hurried her away.
Franceline was too much discomfited
by the abrupt dismissal to
conjecture why she was hustled out
through the house instead of being
allowed to go back through the
church, the natural way, and quite
as short. She could not understand
why Father Henwick should
have shown such annoyance and
surprise at the sight of her. This
was not the first time she had played
the trick on them at home of
coming out to church on a sunny
morning, and it had never done her
any harm. She was turning the
riddle in her mind, as she passed
through the little sitting-room into
the entry, when she saw the front
door standing wide open, and a
gentleman outside speaking to the
fly-man. The moment he perceived
Franceline he raised his hat
and remained uncovered while he
spoke.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, mademoiselle!
How is M. de la Bourbonais?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, my father is quite
well.”</p>

<p>She and Clide looked at each
other as they exchanged this commonplace
greeting; but they did
not shake hands. Neither could
probably have explained what the
feeling was that held them back.
Franceline went on her way, and
Clide de Winton entered the presbytery,
each bearing away the sound
of the other’s voice and the sweetness
of that rapid glance with a
terrible sense of joy.</p>

<p>Franceline’s heart beat high within
her as she walked on. What
right had it to do so? How dared
it? Poor, fluttering heart! No bitter
upbraidings of indignant conscience,
no taunts of womanly pride,
could make it stop. The more she
tried to silence it, the louder it
cried. She was close by The Lilies,
and it was crying out and throbbing
wildly still. She could not
go in and face her father in this
state; she must gain a few minutes
to collect and calm herself. The
snow-drops grew in great profusion
on a bank in the park at the back
of the cottage. Raymond was
fond of wild flowers; she would go
and gather him some: this would
account for her delay. She laid
her muff on the grass. It was wet
with the hoar-frost melting in the
sun; but Franceline did not see
this. She stooped down and began
to pluck the snow-drops. It was a
congenial task in her present frame
of mind. Snow-drops had always
been favorites with her. In her
childish days of innocent pantheism
she used to fancy that flowers
had spirits, or some instinct that enabled
them to enjoy and to suffer,
to be glad in the sunshine and unhappy
in the cold and the rain. She
fancied that perfume was their language,
and that they conversed in
it as birds do in songs and chirpings.
She used to be sorry for the
flowers that had no perfume, and
called them “the dumb ones,” connecting
their fate in some vague,
pitying way with that of two deaf
and dumb little children in the village.
But the snow-drops she pitied
most of all. They came in the
winter-time, when everything was
cold and dreary and there were no
kindred flowers to keep them company;
no roses; no bees and butterflies
to make music for them;
no nightingales to sing them to
sleep in the scented summer nights;
no liquid, starry skies and sweet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_738" id="Page_738">[738]</a></span>
warm dews to kiss them as they
slept; their pale, ascetic little slumbers
were attuned to none of these
fragrant melodies, and Franceline
loved them all the more for their
loveless, lonely life. But she was
not pitying them now, as, one by
one, she plucked the drooping bells
and the bright green leaves under
the silver hedge; she was envying
them and listening to them.
Every flower and blade of grass
has a message for us, if we could
but hear it; the woods and fields
are all tablets on which the primitive
scriptures of creative love are
written for us. “Your life is to be
like ours,” the snow-drops were
whispering to Franceline. “We
dwell alone in cold and silence&mdash;so
must you; we have no sister flowers
to make life joyous, no roses to
gladden us with their perfume and
their beauty&mdash;neither shall you;
roses are emblems of love, and
love is not for you. You must be
content with us. We are the emblems
of purity and hope; take us
to your heart. We are the heralds
of the spring; we bring the promise,
but we do not wait for its fulfilment.
You are happier than we;
you will not have the summer here,
but you know that it will come
hereafter, and that the flowers and
fruits will be only the more beautiful
for the waiting being prolonged.
Look upwards, sister snow-drop,
and take courage.” Franceline listened
to the mystic voice, and, as
she did so, large tears fell from her
eyes on the white bells of the messengers,
as pure as the crystal dew
that stood in frozen tears upon
their leaves.</p>

<p>M. de la Bourbonais had not
heard her go out; and when she
came in and handed him her bouquet,
fresh-gathered, he took for
granted she had gone out for
the purpose, and did not chide her
for the slight imprudence. Angélique
was not so lenient; she was
full of wrath against the truant, and
threatened to go at once and inform
on her, which Franceline remarked
she might have done an
hour ago, if she had any such intention;
and then, with a kiss and two
arms thrown around the old woman’s
mahogany neck, it was all
made right between them.</p>

<p>Franceline did not venture out
again that day. She was afraid of
meeting Clide. She strove hard to
forget the morning’s incident, to
stifle the emotions it had given rise
to, and to turn away her thoughts
from even conjecturing the possible
cause of Mr. de Winton’s presence
at Dullerton and at Father Henwick’s.
But strive as she might,
the thoughts would return, and her
mind would dwell on them. She
was horrified to see the effect that
Clide’s presence had had on her; to
find how potent his memory was
with her still, how it had stirred
the slumbering depths and broken
up the stagnant surface-calm of her
heart, filling it once more with wild
hopes and ardent longings that she
had fondly imagined crushed and
buried for ever. Was her hard-earned
self-conquest a sham after
all? She could not help fearing it
when she saw how persistently the
idea kept returning again and again
to her, banish it as she would:
“Had he come to tell Father Henwick
that he was free?” Then she
wondered, if it were so, what Father
Henwick would do; whether he
would come and see her immediately,
or let things take their course
through Sir Simon and her father.
Then again she would discard this
notion as impossible, and see all
sorts of evidence in the circumstances
of the morning’s episode to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_739" id="Page_739">[739]</a></span>
prove that it could not be. Why
should Father Henwick have tried
so hard to prevent their meeting, if
the one obstacle to it were removed?
and why should Clide have
been so restrained and distant when
she came upon him suddenly? If
only she could ask this one question
and have it answered, Franceline
thought she could go back
again to her state of stagnation, and
trample down her rebellious heart
into submission once more.</p>

<p>She slept very little that night,
and the next morning she determined
that she would go out at
any risk. Sitting still all day in
this state of mind was unbearable;
so about eleven o’clock, when the
sun was high and the frost melted,
she put on her bonnet and said she
was going for a walk to see Miss
Merrywig. As the day was fine and
she had not taken cold yesterday,
Angélique made no difficulty. Franceline
started off to the wood, and
was soon crushing the snow-drops
and the budding lemon-colored
primroses as she threaded her way
along the foot-paths.</p>

<p>For some mysterious reason which
no one could fathom, but which the
oldest inhabitant of the place remembered
always to have existed,
you were kept an hour waiting at
Miss Merrywig’s before the door
was opened. You rang three times,
waited an age between each ring,
and then Keziah, the antediluvian
factotum of the establishment, came
limping along the passage, and, after
another never-ending interval of
unbarring and unbolting, you were
let in. It was not Keziah who
opened the door for Franceline this
morning; it was Miss Merrywig herself,
shawled and bonneted, ready
to go out.</p>

<p>“O my dear child! <em>is</em> it you?
I am <em>so</em> delighted to see you! Do
come in! No, no, I am <em>not</em> going
out. That is to say, I <em>am</em> going out.
It’s the luckiest thing that you did
not come two minutes later, or you
would not have found me. I <em>am</em>
so glad! No, no, you are not putting
me about the least bit in the
world. Come and sit down, and I’ll
explain all about it. I <em>cannot</em> imagine
what is keeping Keziah, and
she knows I am waiting to be off,
and that the negus will be getting
cold, though it was boiling mad, and
I <em>have</em> only this moment put it into
the flask. But what can be keeping
her? It didn’t so much matter; in
fact, it didn’t matter at all, only I
<em>have</em> promised little Jemmy Torrens&mdash;you
know Mary Torrens’ boy on
the green?&mdash;well, I <em>promised</em> him I
would make the negus for him myself
and <em>take</em> it to him myself. He
won’t take anything except from
me, poor little fellow! You see he’s
known me since I was a baby&mdash;I
mean since <em>he</em> was&mdash;and that’s why,
I suppose; and Keziah knows it,
and why she dallies so long I <em>cannot</em>
conceive! She knows I can’t
leave the house unprotected and
go off before she comes in&mdash;there
are so many tramps about, you see,
my dear. It <em>is</em> provoking of
Keziah!”</p>

<p>“Let me take the negus to
Jemmy,” said Franceline, when
there was a break in the stream
and she was able to edge in a word.
“I will explain why you could not
go.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s <em>just</em> like you to be
<em>so</em> kind, my dear; but I <em>promised</em>,
you see, and I really <em>must</em> go myself.
What can Keziah be about?”</p>

<p>“Then go, and I will wait and
keep the house until either of you
comes back,” suggested Franceline.</p>

<p>“Oh! that <em>is</em> a bright idea. That
is as witty as it is kind. Well, then,
I will just run off. I shall find you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_740" id="Page_740">[740]</a></span>
here when I return. I won’t be
twenty minutes away, and you can
amuse yourself looking over <cite>Robinson
Crusoe</cite> till I come back; here it
is!” And the old lady rooted out
a book from under a pile of all sorts
of odds and ends on the table,
and handed it to Franceline. “Sit
down, now, and read that; there’s
nothing I enjoyed like that book
when I was your age, and, indeed, I
make a point of reading it at least
once every year regularly.”</p>

<p>With this she took up her wine-flask,
well wrapped in flannel to
protect her from the scalding-hot
contents, and bustled away.</p>

<p>“If any one rings, am I to let them
in?” inquired Franceline, running
into the hall after her.</p>

<p>“Oh! no, certainly not, unless
it happens to be Mr. Langrove;
you would not mind opening the
door to <em>him</em>, would you?”</p>

<p>“Not the least; but how shall I
know it is he?”</p>

<p>“You will be sure to hear the
footsteps first and the click of the
gate outside, and then run out and
peep through <em>this</em>,” pointing to the
narrow latticed window in the entry;
“but you must be quick, or
else they will be close to the door
and see you.”</p>

<p>Franceline promised to keep a
sharp lookout for the warning steps,
closed the door on Miss Merrywig,
and went back to <cite>Robinson Crusoe</cite>;
but she was not in a mood to enjoy
Friday’s philosophy, so she sat
down and began to look about her
in the queer little apartment. It
was much more like a lumber-room
than a sitting-room; the large
round table in the middle was littered
with every description of rubbish&mdash;the
letters of two generations of
Miss Merrywig’s correspondents,
old pamphlets, odds and ends of
ribbon and lace, little boxes, bags
of stale biscuits that were kept for
the pet dogs of her friends when
they came to visit her, quantities
of china cats and worsted monkeys,
samplers made for her by great-grandnieces,
newspapers of the
year one, tracts and books of
hymns, all huddled pell-mell together.
Fifty years’ smoke and lamp-light
had painted the ceiling all
over in dense black clouds, and the
cobwebs of innumerable defunct
spiders festooned the cornices.
The carpet had half a century ago
been bright with poppies and bluebells
and ferns; but these vanities,
like the memory of the unrighteous
man, had been blotted out, and had
left no trace behind them. Franceline
was considering how singular it
was that anything so bright and simple
and happy as Miss Merrywig
should be the presiding genius of
this abode of incongruous rubbish,
and wishing she could make a clean
sweep of it all, and tidy the place a
little, when her attention was roused
by a sound of footsteps. She
ran out at once to look through the
lattice; but she had waited too
long. There was only time to shrink
behind the door when the visitors
had come up and the bell was
sounding through the cottage.
There were two persons, if not
more; she knew this by the footsteps.
Presently some one spoke;
it was Mr. Charlton. He was
continuing, in a low voice, a conversation
already begun. Then another
voice answered, speaking in
a still lower key; but every word
was distinctly audible through the
open casement, which was so covered
by an outer iron bar and the
straggling stem of a japonica that
no one from the outside would see
that it was open, unless they looked
very close. The words Franceline
overheard had nothing in them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_741" id="Page_741">[741]</a></span>
make her turn pale; but the voice
was Clide de Winton’s. What fatality
was this that brought them so
near again, and yet kept them apart,
and condemned her to hide and
listen to him like an eavesdropper?
There was a pause after the first
ring. Mr. Charlton knew the ways
of the house; he said something
laughingly, and rang again. Then
they reverted to the conversation
that had been interrupted. Good
God! did Franceline’s ears deceive
her, or what were these words
she heard coupled with her father’s
name? She put her hand to her
lips with a sudden movement to
stifle the cry that leaped up from
her heart of hearts. She heard
Clide giving an emphatic denial:
“I don’t believe it. I tell you it is
some mistake&mdash;one of those unaccountable
mistakes that we can’t
explain or understand, but which
we <em>know</em> must be mistakes.”</p>

<p>She could not catch what Mr.
Charlton said; but he was evidently
dissenting from Clide, and muttered
something about “being convicted
on his own showing,” which the
other answered with an impatient
exclamation the drift of which
Franceline could not seize; neither
could she make sense out of
the short comments that followed.
They referred to some facts or circumstances
that were clear to the
speakers, but only bewildered her
more and more.</p>

<p>“It strikes me the old lady does
not mean to let us in at all this
time,” said Mr. Charlton; and he
gave another violent pull to the
bell.</p>

<p>“There can’t be any one in the
house,” said Clide, after a pause
that exhausted the patience of
both. “We may as well come
away. I will call later. I must see
her before.…”</p>

<p>The rest of the sentence was
lost, as the two speakers walked
down the gravel-walk, conversing
in the same low tones.</p>

<p>Franceline did not move even
when the sound of their steps had
long died away. She seemed turned
to stone, and did not stir from
the spot until Keziah came back.
She gave her a message for Miss
Merrywig, left the cottage, and went
home.</p>

<p>She found her father just as she
had left him&mdash;busy at his desk, with
books and papers strewn on the
table beside him. She saw this
through the window, but did not
go in to him. She could not go at
once and speak to him as if nothing
had happened in the interval.
She went to her room, and remained
there until dinner-time, and
then came down, half-dreading to
see some alteration in him corresponding
with what had taken place
in her own mind. But he was gentle
and serene as usual. No mental
disturbance was visible on his features;
at least, she did not see it.
Looking at him, nevertheless, with
perceptions quickened by what she
had heard since they parted, it
struck her that his eyes were sunk
and dim, as if from overwork and
want of sleep combined; but there
was no cloud of shame or humiliation
on his brow. Never had that
dear head seemed so venerable,
never had such a halo of nobleness
and goodness encircled it, in his
daughter’s eyes, as at this moment.</p>

<p>She did not tease him to come
out to walk with her, but asked
him to read aloud to her for an
hour while she worked. It was a
long time&mdash;more than a week&mdash;since
they had had any reading aloud.
Raymond complied with the request,
but soon returned to his
work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_742" id="Page_742">[742]</a></span></p>

<p>Franceline expected that Father
Henwick would call, and kept nervously
looking out of the window
from time to time; but the day
wore on, and the evening, and he
did not come. She did not know
whether to be glad or sorry. She
was in that frame of feeling when
the gentlest touch of sympathy
would have stung her like the bite
of a snake. It was not sympathy
she wanted, but a voice to join
with her in passionate contempt for
the liars who had dared to slander
her father, and in indignant denunciation
of the lie. She wanted to
fling it in the teeth of those who
had uttered it. If Father Henwick
would help her to do this, let
him come; if not, let him leave her
alone. Let no one come near her
with words of pity; pity for her
now meant contempt for her father.
She would resent it as a lioness
might resent the food that was
thrown to her in place of the cubs
she had been robbed of. No love&mdash;no,
not the best and noblest she
had ever dreamed of&mdash;would compensate
her for the absence of reverence
and respect for her father.</p>

<p>But Clide did not suspect him.
She had heard him indignantly
spurn the idea. “He no more
stole it than you did,” he had
said. Stolen what? Would no
one come to tell her what it all
meant? Would not Clide come?
Was he still at Dullerton? Was
there any fear&mdash;or hope?&mdash;of her
meeting him again if she went out?
She might have gone with impunity.
Clide was far enough away, on a
very different errand from that
which had brought him yesterday
across her path.</p>

<p class="break">On coming back to the Court
from his abortive attempt to see
Miss Merrywig, Clide found Stanton
in great excitement with a telegram
that had arrived for his master
that instant. It was from Sir
Simon, summoning him back by
the first train that started. Some
important news awaited him. He
did not wait to see Miss Merrywig,
but took the next train to London,
and arrived there in the early afternoon.
The news that awaited him
was startling enough to justify
Sir Simon’s peremptory summons.
One of the detectives, whose sagacity
and coolness fitted him for delicate
missions of the kind, had been
despatched to gather information
in the principal lunatic asylums of
England and Scotland. He had
come that morning to tell Sir Simon
Harness that he thought he
had found Mrs. de Winton in one
of them. Sir Simon went straight
to the place, and, after an interview
with the superintendent, telegraphed
for Clide, as we have seen.</p>

<p>It was an old-fashioned Elizabethan
manor-house in the suburbs
of London, situated in the midst of
grounds almost large enough to be
called a park. There was nothing
in the outward aspect of the place
to suggest its real character. Everything
was bright and peaceful and
well ordered as in the abode of a
wealthy private family. The gardens
were beautifully kept; the
shrubbery was trim and neat;
summer-houses with pretty climbing
plants rose in shady places, inviting
the inmates of the fine old
mansion to sit out of doors and enjoy
the sunshine unmolested; for
there was sunshine in this early
spring-time, and here in this sheltered
spot some bits of red and
gold and blue were peeping through
the tips of closed flower-cups. Nothing
externally hinted at the discord
and disorder that reigned in so
many human lives within the walls.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_743" id="Page_743">[743]</a></span>
The sight of the place was soothing
to Clide. He had so often pictured
to himself another sort of dwelling
for his unhappy Isabel that it
was a great relief to him to see this
well-ordered, calm abode, and to
think of her being a resident there.
A lady-like matron received him,
and conversed with him kindly and
sensibly while they were waiting
for the doctor to come in. The
latter accosted him with the same
reassuring frankness of manner.</p>

<p>“I hope,” he said, “that your
informant has not exaggerated matters,
as that class of people are so
apt to do, and that you are <em>expecting</em>
to see the right person. All I dare
say to you is that you may hope;
the points of coincidence are striking
enough to warrant hope, but by
no means such as to establish a certainty.”</p>

<p>“I am too much taken by surprise
to have arrived at any conclusion,”
replied Clide; “and I have
been too often disappointed to do
so in a hurry. Until I see and
speak to the patient I can say nothing.”</p>

<p>“You can see her at once. As
to speaking to her, that is not so
easy. The sun is clouding over.
That is unlucky at this moment.”</p>

<p>His visitor looked surprised.</p>

<p>“Oh! I forgot that I had not explained
to you the nature of the
delusion which this lady is suffering
from,” continued the medical
man. “It is one of the most poetic
fancies that madness ever engendered
in a human brain. She is
enamored of the sun, and fancies
herself beloved of him; she believes
him to be a benign deity
whose love she has been privileged
to win, and which she passionately
responds to. But there is more
suffering than joy in this belief.
She fancies that when the sun shines
he is pleased with her, and that
when he ceases to shine he is angry;
the sunbeams are his smiles and
the warmth his kisses. At such
times she will deck herself out with
flowers and gay colors, and sit and
sing to her lover by the hour, pretending
to turn away her face and
hide from him, and going through
all the pretty coyness of love. Then
suddenly, when the sun draws behind
a cloud, she will burst into
tears, fling aside her wreath, and
give way to every expression of
grief and despair. It is at such
moments, when they are prolonged,
that the crisis is liable to become
dangerous. She flings herself on
the ground, and cries out to her
lover to forgive her and look on
her kindly again, or she will die.
Very often she cries herself to sleep
in this way. I fear you have come
at an unfortunate moment, for the
sun seems quite clouded; however,
he may come out again, and then
you will get a glimpse of the patient
at her best.”</p>

<p>He rose and led the way upstairs
along a softly-carpeted corridor
with doors opening on either
side. Pointing to one, he motioned
Clide to advance. One of the
panels was perforated so as to admit
of the keeper’s seeing what went
on inside when it was necessary to
watch the patient, without irritating
her by seeming to do so or remaining
in the room. At first the
occupant was standing up at the
window, her hands clasped, while
she conversed with herself or some
invisible companion in low tones
of entreaty. Then, uttering a
feeble cry, she turned mournfully
away, laid aside the flowers that
decked her long black hair, and,
taking a large black cloak, drew it
over her dress, and sat down in a
dark corner of the room, with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_744" id="Page_744">[744]</a></span>
face to the wall, crying to herself
like a child. Clide watched her go
through all this with growing emotion.
He had not yet been able
to catch a glimpse of her face, but
the small, light figure, the wayward
movements, the streaming black
hair, all reminded him strikingly
of Isabel. The voice was too inarticulate,
so far, for him to pronounce
on its resemblance with
any certainty; but the low, plaintive
tones fell on his ear like the
broken bars of an unforgotten
melody. He strained every nerve to
see the features. But, stay! She is
moving. She has drawn away her
hands from her face, and has turned
it towards him. The movement
did not, however, dispel his doubts;
it increased them. It was almost
impossible to discover any trace
of beauty in that worn, haggard
face, with its sharp features, its
eyes faded and sunk, and from
which the tears streamed in torrents,
as if they were melting away in
brine. The skin was shrivelled
like an old woman’s&mdash;one, at least,
double the age that Isabel would
be now. Was it possible that this
wreck could be the bright, beautiful
girl of ten years ago?</p>

<p>“Are <em>you</em> my wife?” was Clide’s
mental exclamation, as he looked
at the sad spectacle, and then, with
a shudder, turned away.</p>

<p>“I see you are unable to arrive
at any conclusion,” said the doctor
when they were out of ear-shot in
an adjoining room.</p>

<p>“I will say nothing till I have
spoken to her,” replied the young
man evasively. “When can I do
this?”</p>

<p>“I cannot possibly fix a time.
She is not in a mood to be approached
now; any violent shock
in her present state might have a
fatal result. It would, in all probability,
quench for ever the feeble
spark of light that still remains,
and might bring on a crisis which
no skill could alleviate. On the
other hand, if we could apply the
test at the right moment, the effect
might be unexpectedly beneficial.
I say unexpectedly, because, for
my own part, I have not the slightest
hope of any such result.”</p>

<p>“Has her memory quite gone,
or does she recall any passages of
her past life accurately?”</p>

<p>“Not accurately, I fancy; she
seems to have some very vivid impressions
of the past, but whether
they be clear or not I cannot say.
The balance of the mind is, I believe,
too deeply shaken for clearness,
even on isolated points, to
survive in any of the faculties.
She talks frequently of going over
a great waterfall with her nurse,
and describes scenery in a way that
rather gave me a hope once. I
spoke to her guardian, however,
and he said she had never been
near a waterfall in her life; that it
was some picture which had apparently
dwelt in her imagination.”</p>

<p>“He might have his own reasons
for deceiving you in that respect,”
observed Clide. “His name, you
say, is Par…?</p>

<p>“Percival&mdash;Mr. Percival.”</p>

<p>“Humph! When people change
their names, they sometimes find it
convenient to retain the initial,”
remarked Clide.</p>

<p>He went home and desired Stanton
to look out for a lodging as
near as possible to the asylum. A
tolerably habitable one was found
without delay, and he and his valet
installed themselves there at once.
The very next day he received a
letter from Sir Simon Harness, informing
him that Lady Rebecca
seemed this time in earnest about
betaking herself to a better world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_745" id="Page_745">[745]</a></span>
and had desired him, Sir Simon,
to be sent for immediately. The
French <i lang="fr">dame de compagnie</i> who
wrote to him said they hardly expected
her to get through the week.</p>

<p class="break">M. de la Bourbonais had never
been a social man since he lived at
Dullerton. He said he did not
care for society, and in one sense
this was true. He did not care for
it unless it was composed of sympathetic
individuals; otherwise he preferred
being without it. He did
not want to meet and talk with his
fellow-creatures simply because they
were his fellow-creatures; there
must be some common bond of interest
or sympathy between them
and him, or else he did not want to
see them. When, in the early days
at The Lilies, Sir Simon used to
remonstrate with him on being
so “sauvage,” and wonder how he
could bear the dulness, Raymond
would reply that no dulness oppressed
him like uncongenial company.
He had no sympathies in
common with the people about the
neighborhood, and so he would
have no pleasure in associating
with them. There was truth in
this; but Sir Simon knew that the
count’s susceptible pride had influenced
him also. He did not want
rich people to see his poverty, if
they were not refined and intelligent
enough to respect it and value
what went along with it. He had
studiously avoided cultivating any
intimacies beyond the few we know,
and had so persistently kept aloof
from the big houses round about
that they had accepted his determination
not to go beyond mere
acquaintanceship, and never stopped
to speak when they met him
out walking, but bowed and passed
on. But of late Raymond began
to feel quite differently about all
this. He longed to see these distant
acquaintances as if they had
been so many near friends; to meet
their glance of kindly, if not cordial,
recognition; to receive the
homage of their passing salutation.
It was the dread of seeing these
hitherto valueless greetings refused
that prevented him stirring beyond
his own gate. He marvelled himself
at the void that the absence of
them was making in his life. He
did not dream they had filled such
a space in it; that the reflection of
his own self-respect in the respect
of others had been such a strength
and such a need to him. Up to
this time Franceline had more than
satisfied all his need of society at
home, with the pleasant periodical
addition of Sir Simon’s presence,
while his work had amply supplied
his intellectual wants; but suddenly
he was made aware of a new need&mdash;something
undefined, but that he
hungered for with a downright physical
hunger.</p>

<p>Franceline’s spirit and heart were
too closely bound up in her father’s
not to feel the counter-pang of this
mental hunger. She could not
help watching him, though she
strove not to do it, and, above all,
not to let him see that she was
watching him. She might as well
have tried not to draw her breath
or to stop the pulsations of her
heart. Her eyes would fasten on
him when he was not looking, and
she could not but see that the expression
of his face was changed.
A hard, resolved look had come
over it; his eyebrows were always
protruded now, and his lips drawn
tight together under the gray fringe
of his mustache. She knew every
turn of his features, and saw that
what had once been a passing
freak under some sudden thought
or puzzling speculation in his work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_746" id="Page_746">[746]</a></span>
had now become a settled habit.
She longed to speak; to invite him
to speak. It would have been so
much easier for both; it would lighten
the burden to them so much if
they could bear it together, instead
of toiling under it apart. But Raymond
was silent. It never crossed
his mind for a moment that Franceline
knew his secret. If he <em>had</em>
known it, would he have spoken?
Sometimes the poor child felt the silence
was unbearable; that at any
cost she must break it and know the
truth of the story which had reached
her in so monstrous a form.
But the idea that her father knew
possibly nothing of it kept her
back. But supposing he was silent
only to spare her? Perhaps he
was debating in his own mind what
the effect of the revelation would
be on her; wondering if she, too,
would join with his accusers, or,
even if she did not do this, whether
she might not be ashamed of a
father who was branded as a thief.
When these thoughts coursed
through her mind, Franceline felt
an almost irresistible impulse to
rush and fling her arms around his
neck and tell him how she venerated
him, and how she scorned with
all her might and main the envious,
malignant fools who dared to so
misjudge him. But she never
yielded to the impulse; the inward
conflict of lodgings and shrinkings
and passionate, tender cries of her
heart to his made no outward sign.
Raymond sat writing away at his
desk, and Franceline sat by the fire
or at the window reading and working,
day after day. The idea occurred
to her more than once that she
would write to Sir Simon; but she
never did. She did not dare open
her heart to Father Henwick. How
could she bring herself to tell him
that her father was accused of theft?
It was most probable&mdash;she hoped
certain&mdash;that the abominable suspicion
had not travelled to his ears;
and if so, she could not speak of it.
This was not her secret; it was no
breach of confidence towards her
spiritual father to be silent, and the
selfish longing to pour out her filial
anger and outraged love into a
sympathizing ear should not hurry
her into a betrayal of what was,
even in its falsity, humiliating to
Raymond. It was hard to refrain
from speech when speech would
have been a solace; but Franceline
knew that the sacrifice of the cup
of cold water has its reward, just
as the bestowal has. Peace comes
to us on surer and swifter wing
when we go straight to God for
it, without putting the sympathy
of creatures between us and his
touch.</p>

<p>Mr. Langrove had never been a
frequent visitor at The Lilies; but
Franceline never remembered him
to have been so long absent as now,
and she could not but see a striking
coincidence in the fact. She knew
he had been one of the party at
Dullerton that night; and if, as she
felt certain, that had been the occasion
of the extraordinary mistake
she had heard of, the vicar, of
course, knew all about it. He believed
her father had committed a
theft, and was keeping aloof from
him. Did everybody at Dullerton
know this? Mr. Langrove was
not a man to spread evil reports in
any shape. Franceline knew him
well enough to be sure of that; but
her father’s reputation was evidently
at the mercy of less charitable
tongues. She did not know that
the six witnesses had promised Sir
Simon to keep silence for his sake;
but if she had known it, it would
not have much reassured her. A
secret that is known to six people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_747" id="Page_747">[747]</a></span>
can scarcely be considered safe.
The six may mean to guard it, and
may only speak of it among themselves
and in whispers; but it is
astonishing how far a whisper will
travel sometimes, especially when
it is malignant. A vague impression
had in some inexplicable
way got abroad that the count had
done something which threw him
under a cloud. The gentlemen of
the neighborhood were very discreet
about it, and had said nothing positively
to be taken hold of, but it
had leaked out that there was a
screw loose in that direction.
Young Charlton had laughed at the
notion of his friend Anwyll thinking
of Mlle. de la Bourbonais <em>now</em>;
and the emphasis and smile which
accompanied the assurance expressed
pretty clearly that there was
something amiss which had not
been amiss a little while ago.</p>

<p>Franceline had gone out for her
usual mid-day walk in the park. It
was the most secluded spot where
she could take it, as well as warm
and sheltered. She was walking
near the pond; the milk-white swans
were sailing towards her in the sunlight,
expecting the bits of bread
she had taken a fancy to bring
them every day at this hour, when
she saw Mr. Langrove emerge from
behind a large rockery and step
out into the avenue. She trembled
as if the familiar form of her old
friend had been a wild animal
creeping out of the jungle to
pounce upon her. What would he
do? Would he pass her by, or
stop and just say a few cold words
of politeness? The vicar did not
keep her long in suspense.</p>

<p>“Well! here, you are enjoying
the sunshine, I see. And how are
you?” he said, extending his hand
in the mild, affectionate way that
Franceline was accustomed to, but
had never thought so sweet before.
“Is the cough quite gone?”</p>

<p>“Not quite; but I am better,
thank you. Angélique says I am,
and she knows more about it than
I do,” replied the invalid playfully.
“How is everybody at the vicarage?”</p>

<p>“So-so. Arabella has one of
her bad colds, and Godiva is suffering
from a toothache. It’s the spring
weather, no doubt; we will all be
brisker by and by. Are you going
my way?”</p>

<p>“Any way; I only came for a
walk.”</p>

<p>They walked on together.</p>

<p>“And how is M. de la Bourbonais?”
said the vicar presently.
“I’ve not met him for a long time;
we used to come across each other
pretty often on the road to Dullerton.
He’s not poorly, I hope?”</p>

<p>“No, only busy&mdash;so dreadfully
busy! He hardly lets the pen out
of his hand now; but he promises
me there will soon be an end of it,
and that the book will soon be finished.”</p>

<p>“Bravo! And you have been
such a capital little secretary to
him!” said Mr. Langrove. “The
next thing will be that we shall
have you writing a book on your
own account.”</p>

<p>Franceline laughed merrily at
this conceit; her fears were, if not
banished by his cordial manner,
sufficiently allayed to rid her
of her momentary awkwardness.
They were soon chatting away
about village gossip as if nothing
were amiss with either.</p>

<p>“Angélique brought home news
from the market a few days ago
that Mr. Tobes was going to marry
Miss Bulpit; is it true?” inquired
the young girl.</p>

<p>“Far too good to be true!” said
the vicar, shaking his head. “The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_748" id="Page_748">[748]</a></span>
report has been spread so often
that this time I very nearly believed
in it. However, I saw Miss
Bulpit, and she dispelled the illusion
at once, and, I fear, for ever.”</p>

<p>“But would it have been such
a good thing if they got married?”</p>

<p>“It would be a very desirable
event in some ways,” said Mr.
Langrove, with a peculiar smile;
“it would give her something to
do and some one to look after
her.”</p>

<p>“And it would have been a good
thing for Mr. Tobes, too, would it
not? He is so poor!”</p>

<p>“That’s just why she won’t have
him, poor fellow! When he proposed&mdash;she
told me the story herself,
and I find she is telling it right
and left, so there is no breach of
confidence in repeating it&mdash;when
he proposed, Miss Bulpit asked
him point-blank how much money
he had; ‘because,’ she said, ‘I
have only just enough for one!’”</p>

<p>“Oh! but that was a shame.
She has plenty for two; and, besides,
it was unfeeling. Don’t you think
it was?” inquired Franceline, looking
up at the vicar. But he evidently
did not share either her indignation
against Miss Bulpit or her
pity for the discarded lover. He
was laughing quietly, as if he enjoyed
the joke.</p>

<p>They reached the gate going
out on the high-road while thus
pleasantly chatting.</p>

<p>“Now I suppose we must say
good-by,” said Mr. Langrove. “This
is my way; I am going to pay a
sick visit down in the valley.”</p>

<p>They shook hands, and Franceline
turned back.</p>

<p>“Mind you give my compliments
to the count!” said the vicar, calling
after her. “Tell him I don’t dare
go near him, as he is so busy; but if
he likes me to drop in of an evening,
let him send me word by you,
and I’ll be delighted. By-by.”</p>

<p>He nodded to her and closed the
gate behind him.</p>

<p>“He did not dare because he
is so busy!” repeated Franceline
as she walked on. “How did he
know papa was busy? It was I
who told him so a few minutes ago.
That was an excuse.”</p>

<p>She gave the message, nevertheless,
on coming home, scarcely daring
to look at her father while she
did so.</p>

<p>“May I tell him to come in one
of these evenings, petit père?”</p>

<p>“No; I cannot be disturbed at
present,” was the peremptory answer,
and Franceline’s heart sank
again.</p>

<p>She told him the gossip about
Miss Bulpit and Mr. Tobes, thinking
it would amuse him; he used
to listen complacently to the little
bits of gossip she brought in about
their neighbors. Raymond had the
charming faculty, common to great
men and learned men, of being
easily and innocently amused; but
he seemed to have lost it of late.
He listened to Franceline’s chatter
to-day with an absent air, as if he
hardly took it in; and before she
had done, he made some irrelevant
remark that proved he had not
been attending to what she was saying.
Then he had got into a way
of repeating himself&mdash;of saying
the same thing two or three times
over at an interval of an hour or
so, sometimes even less. Franceline
attributed these things to the
concentration of his thoughts on
his work, and to his being so entirely
absorbed in it as not to pay attention
to anything that did not
directly concern it. She was too
inexperienced to see therein symptoms
of a more alarming nature.</p>

<p>M. de la Bourbonais had all his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_749" id="Page_749">[749]</a></span>
life complained of being a bad
sleeper; but Angélique, who suffered
from the same infirmity, always
declared that he only imagined he
did not sleep; that she was tossing
on her pillow, listening to him
snoring, when he said he had been
wide awake. The count, on his
side, was sceptical about Angélique’s
“white nights,” and privately confided
to Franceline that he knew
for a fact she was fast asleep often
when she fancied in the morning
she had been awake. Some people
are very touchy at being doubted
when they say they have not “closed
an eye all night.” Angélique
resented a doubt on her “white
nights” bitterly, and Franceline,
who from childhood had been the
confidant of both parties, found an
early exercise for tact and discretion
in keeping the peace between
them. The discrepancies in the
two accounts of their respective
vigils often gave rise to little tiffs
between herself and Angélique, who
would insist upon knowing what
M. le Comte had said about <em>her</em>
night; so that Franceline was compelled
to aggravate her whether she
would or not. She “knew her
place” better than to have words
with M. le Comte, but she had it
out with Franceline. “Monsieur
says he didn’t get to sleep till past
two o’clock this morning, does he?
Humph! I only wish I had slept
half as well, I know. Pauvre, cher
homme! He drops off the minute
his head is on the pillow, and then
dreams that he’s wide awake.
That’s how it is. Why, this morning
I was up and lighted my candle
at ten minutes to two, and he was
sleeping as sound as a wooden
shoe! I heard him.” Franceline
would soothe her by saying she
quite believed her; but as she said
the same thing to M. le Comte, and
as Angélique generally overheard
her saying so, this seeming credulity
only aggravated her the more. Laterly
Raymond had taken up a
small celestial globe to his room,
for the purpose, he said, of utilizing
his long vigils by studying the face
of the heavens during the clear,
starry nights; and he would give
the result of his nocturnal contemplations
to Franceline at breakfast
next morning&mdash;Angélique being
either in the room pouring out the
hot milk for her master’s coffee, or
in the kitchen with the door ajar,
so that she had the benefit of the
conversation. The pantomimes
that were performed at these times
were a severe trial to Franceline’s
gravity: Angélique would stand
behind Raymond’s chair, holding
up her hands aghast or stuffing her
apron into her mouth, so as not to
explode in disrespectful laughter.
Sometimes she would shake her
flaps at him with an air of despondency
too deep for words, and then
walk out of the room.</p>

<p>“I heard M. le Comte telling
mam’selle that he saw the Three
Kings (the popular name for Orion’s
belt in French) shining so bright
this morning at three o’clock. I
believe you; he saw them in his
sleep! I was up and walking about
my room at that hour, and it so happened
that I opened my door to
let in the air <em>just</em> as the clock in
the <i lang="fr">salon</i> was striking three!”</p>

<p>As ill-luck would have it, Raymond
overheard this confidential
comment which Angélique was
making to Franceline under the
porch, not seeing that the sitting-room
window was open.</p>

<p>“My good Angélique,” said the
count, putting his head out of the
window, “you must have opened
the door two seconds too late; it
was striking five, most likely, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_750" id="Page_750">[750]</a></span>
you only heard the last three
strokes. I suspect you were sound
asleep at the hour I was looking at
the Three Kings.”</p>

<p>“La! as if I were an infant not
to know when I wake and when I
sleep!” said Angélique with a shrug.
“It was M. le Comte that was
asleep and dreaming that he saw
the Three Kings.”</p>

<p>“Nay, but I lighted my candle;
it was pitch-dark when I got up to
set the globe,” argued M. de la
Bourbonais.</p>

<p>“When M. le Comte <em>dreamt</em> that
he got up and lighted his candle,”
corrected the incorrigible
sceptic. Raymond laughed and
gave it up. But it was true, notwithstanding
Angélique’s obstinate
incredulity, that he did pass many
white nights now, and the wakefulness
was insensibly and imperceptibly
telling on his health. It was
a curious fact, too, that the more the
want of sleep was injuring him, the
less he was conscious of suffering
from it. He had been passionately
fond of astronomy in his youth,
and he had resumed the long-neglected
study with something of
youthful zest, enjoying the observation
of the starry constellations
in the bright midnight silence with
a sense of repose and communion
with those brilliant, far-off worlds
that surprised and delighted himself.
Perhaps the feeling that he
was now cut off from possible communion
with his fellow-men threw
him more on nature for companionship,
urging him to seek on her
glorious brow for the smiles that
human faces denied him, and to
accept her loving fellowship in lieu
of the sympathy that his brothers
refused him.</p>

<p>But rich and inexhaustible as the
treasures of the great mother are,
they are at best but a compensation;
nothing but human love and
human intercourse can satisfy the
cravings of a human heart. Raymond
was beginning to realize this.
His forced isolation was becoming
poignantly oppressive to him.
He longed to see Sir Simon, to hear
his voice, to feel the warm clasp
of his hand; he longed, above all,
to get back his old feeling of gratitude
to him. Raymond little suspected
what a moral benefactor
his light-hearted, worldly-minded
friend had been to him all those
years when he was perpetually
offering services that were so seldom
accepted. Sir Simon was all
the time feeding his heart with the
milk of human kindness, making
a bond between the proud, poor
brother and the rest of the rich
and happy brotherhood who were
strangers to him. Raymond loved
them all for the sake of this one.
Nothing nourishes our hearts like
gratitude. It widens our space for
love, and enlarges our capacity for
kindness; it creates a want in us to
send the same happy thrills through
other hearts that are stirring our
own. We overflow with love to
all in thankfulness for the love
of one. This is often our only
way of giving thanks, and the
good it does us is sometimes a
more abiding gain than the service
that has called it forth. It was all
this that Raymond missed in Sir
Simon. In losing his loving sense
of gratefulness he seemed to have
lost some vital warmth in his own
life. Now that the source which
had fed this gratitude was dried up,
all that was tender and kind and
good in him seemed to be running
dry or turning to bitterness. The
estrangement of one had estranged
him from all; he was at war with
all humanity. Would any sacrifice
of pride be too great to win back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_751" id="Page_751">[751]</a></span>
the old sweet life, with its trust,
and ready sympathy, and indulgent
kindness? Why should he not
write to Sir Simon? He had asked
himself this many times, and had
written many letters in imagination,
and some even in reality; but Angélique
had found them torn up in
the waste-paper basket next morning,
and had been surprised to see
the fresh sheets of note-paper,
which she recognized as her
master’s, wasted in that manner
and thrown away. He knew what
he was doing, probably; it was not
for her to lecture him on such matters,
but she could not help setting
down the unnatural extravagance
as a part of the general something
that was amiss with her master.</p>

<p>One morning, however, after one
of those white nights that gave rise
to so much discussion in the family,
Raymond came down with his mind
made up to write a letter and send
it. He could stand it no longer;
he must go to his friend and lay
bare his heart to him, so that they
might come together again. If Sir
Simon’s silence was an offence,
Raymond’s was not free from blame.
He sat down and wrote. It was a
long letter&mdash;several sheets closely
filled. When it was finished, and
Raymond was folding it and putting
it into the envelope, he remembered
that he did not know
where the baronet was. If he sent
it to the Court, the servants would
recognize the handwriting and
think it odd his addressing a
letter there in their master’s absence.
He thought of forwarding
it to Sir Simon’s bankers; but then,
again, how did matters stand at
present between him and them?
He might have gone abroad and
not left them his address, and the
letter might remain there indefinitely.
While Raymond was debating
what he should do he closed
up and stamped the blank envelope,
making it ready to be addressed;
then he laid it on the top of his writing
desk, and wrote a few lines to
the bankers, requesting them to
forward Sir Simon’s address, if
they had it or could inform him
how a letter would reach him.</p>

<p>He seemed relieved when this
was done, and, for the first time for
nearly a month, called Franceline
to come and write for him. She
did so for a couple of hours, and
noticed with thankfulness that her
father was in very good, almost in
high, spirits, laughing and talking
a great deal, as if elated by some
inward purpose. Her glad surprise
was increased when he said
abruptly:</p>

<p>“Now, my little one, run and put
on thy bonnet, and we will go for a
walk in the park together.”</p>

<p>The day was cold, and there was
a sharp wind blowing; but the sun
was very bright, and the park looked
green and fresh and beautiful as
they entered it, she leaning on him
with a fond little movement from
time to time and an exclamation
of pleasure. He smiled on her
very tenderly, and chatted about
all sorts of things as in the old days
of a month ago before the strange
cloud had drawn a curtain between
their lives. He talked with great
animation of his work, and the
excitement it would be to them
both when it was published.</p>

<p>“We shall go to Paris for the publication,
and then I will show thee
the wonderful sights of the great
city: the Louvre, and the Museum
of Cluny, and many antiquities
that will interest thee mightily;
and we will go to some fine <i lang="fr">modiste</i>
and get thee a smart French bonnet,
and thou wilt be quite a little
<i lang="fr">élégante</i>!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_752" id="Page_752">[752]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh! how nice it will be, petit
père,” cried Franceline, squeezing
his arm in childish glee; “and many
learned men will be coming to see
you, will they not, and writing
articles in praise of your great
work?”</p>

<p>“Ha! Praise! I know not if it
will all be praise,” said the author,
with a dubious smile. “Some will
not approve of my views on certain
historical pets. I have torn the
masks off many <i lang="fr">soi-disant</i> heroes,
and replaced others in the position
that bigotry or ignorance has
hitherto denied them. I wonder
what Simon will say to it all?”</p>

<p>Raymond smiled complacently
as he said this. It was the first
time he had mentioned the baronet.
Franceline felt as if a load
were lifted off her, and that all the
mists were clearing away.</p>

<p>“He is sure to be delighted with
it!” she exclaimed. “He always is,
even when he quarrels with you,
petit père. I think he quarrels for
the pleasure of it; and then he is
so proud of you!”</p>

<p>They walked as far as the house,
and then Raymond said it was time
to turn back; it was too cold for
Franceline to stay out more than
half an hour.</p>

<p>An event had taken place at The
Lilies in their absence. The postman
had been there and had
brought a letter. Raymond started
when Angélique met him at the
door with this announcement, adding
that she had left it on the chimney-piece.</p>

<p>He went straight in and opened
it. It was from Sir Simon. After
explaining in two lines how Clide
de Winton had arrived in time to
save him at the last hour, the writer
turned at once to Raymond’s
troubles. Nothing could be gentler
than the way he approached
the delicate subject. “Why should
we be estranged from one another,
Raymond? Do you suppose I suspect
you? And what if I did? I
defy even that to part us. The
friendship that can change was
never genuine; ours can know no
change. I have tried in every possible
way to account satisfactorily
for your strange, your suicidal behavior
on that night, and I have
not succeeded. I can only conclude
that you were beside yourself
with anxiety, and over-excited,
and incapable of measuring the effect
of your refusal and your conduct
altogether. But admitting, for
argument’s sake, that you did take
it; what then? There is such a
thing as momentary insanity from
despair, as the delirium of a sick
and fevered heart. At such moments
the noblest men have been
driven to commit acts that would
be criminal if they were not mad.
It would ill become <em>me</em> to cast a
stone at <em>you</em>&mdash;I, who have been no
better than a swindler these twenty
years past! Raymond, there can
be no true friendship without full
confidence. We may give our confidence
sometimes without our love
following; but when we give our
love, our confidence must of necessity
follow. When we have once
given the key of our heart to a
friend, we have given him the right
to enter into it at all times, to read
its secrets, to open every door, even
that, and above that, behind which
the skeleton stands concealed.
You and I gave each other this
right when we were boys, Raymond;
we have used it loyally
one towards the other ever since,
and I have done nothing to forfeit
the privilege now. All things are
arranged by an overruling Providence,
and God is wise as he is
merciful; yet I cannot forbear asking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_753" id="Page_753">[753]</a></span>
how it is that I should have
been saved from myself, and that
you should not have been delivered
from temptation&mdash;you, whose life
has been one long triumph of virtue
over adversity! It will be all
made square one day; meantime, I
bless God that the weaker brother
has been mercifully dealt with and
permitted to rescue the nobler and
the worthier one. The moment I
hear from you I will come to Dullerton,
and you and Franceline
must come away with me to the
south. I will explain when we
meet why this letter has been so
long delayed.” Then came a postscript
quite at the bottom of the
page: “Send that wretched bauble
to me in a box, addressed to my
bankers. Rest assured of one
thing: you shall be cleared before
men as you already are before a
higher and a more merciful tribunal.”</p>

<p>Many changes passed over Raymond’s
countenance as he read this
letter; but when his eye fell on the
postscript, the smile that had hovered
between sadness, tenderness,
and scorn subsided into one of almost
saturnine bitterness, and a
light gathered in his eyes that
was not goodly to see. But the
feelings which these signs betrayed
found no other outward vent. M.
de la Bourbonais quietly and deliberately
tore up the letter into
very small pieces, and then, instead
of throwing them into the waste-paper
basket, he dropped them into
the grate. The fire was low; he
took the poker and stirred it to
make a blaze, and then watched
the flame catching the bits one by
one and consuming them.</p>

<p>“It is fortunate I did not send
mine!” was his mental congratulation
as he turned to his desk, intending
to feed the dying flame with
two more offerings. But where
were they? Raymond pushed
about his papers, but could not find
either of the letters. Angélique
was called. Had she seen them?</p>

<p>“Oh! yes; I gave them both to
the postman,” she explained, with
a nod of her flaps that implied mystery.</p>

<p>“How both? There was only one
to go. The other had no address
on it,” said Raymond.</p>

<p>“I saw it, M. le Comte.” Another
mysterious nod.</p>

<p>“And yet you gave it to the postman?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I am a discreet woman,
as M. le Comte knows, and he
might have trusted me to keep a
quiet tongue in my head; but monsieur
knows his own affairs best,”
added Angélique in an aggrieved
tone.</p>

<p>“My good Angélique, explain
yourself a little more lucidly,” said
M. de la Bourbonais with slight impatience.
“What could induce you
to give the postman a letter that
had neither name nor address on
it?”</p>

<p>“Bless me! I thought M. le
Comte did not wish me to know
who he was writing to!”</p>

<p>“Good gracious!” exclaimed
Raymond, too annoyed to notice
the absurdity of the reply. “But
how could the postman take it
when he saw it was a blank envelope?”</p>

<p>“I did not let him see it; I slipped
the two with my own hands
into the bag,” said Angélique.</p>

<p>M. de la Bourbonais moved his
spectacles, and shrugged his shoulders
in a way that was expressive
of anything but gratitude for this
zeal. He hesitated a moment or
two, debating what he should do.
The only way to ensure getting
back his letter immediately was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_754" id="Page_754">[754]</a></span>
to go off himself to the post-office,
and claim it before it was
taken out to be stamped with the
postmark, when it would be opened
in order to be returned to the
writer. There might be no harm
in its being opened; the postmaster
was not a French scholar that
Raymond knew of, but he might
have a friend at hand who was, and
who would be glad to gratify his
curiosity, as well as exhibit his
learning, by reading the count’s
letter.</p>

<p>Raymond set off at once, so as to
prevent this. It was the first time
for some weeks that he had
shown himself in or near the town;
and if his mind had not been so
full of his errand, he would have
been painfully conscious and shy at
finding himself abroad in open daylight
in his old haunts and within
the observation of many eyes that
knew him. But he did not give this
a thought; he was calculating the
chances for and against his arriving
at the post-office before the postman
had come back from his rounds
and handed in the out-going letters
to be marked, and his imagination
was running on to the wildest conclusions
in the event of his being
too late. He walked as if for a
wager; not running, but as near to
it as possible. The pace and his
intense look of preoccupation attracted
many glances that he would
have escaped had he walked on
quietly at his ordinary pace. He
was not a minute too soon, however,
just coming up as the postman appeared
with his replenished bag.
M. de la Bourbonais hastened to
describe the shape and color of his
blank envelope, and to explain how
it had come to be where it was, and
was most emphatic in protesting
that he did not mean the letter to
go, and that he was prepared to
take any steps to prevent its going.
There was no need to be so earnest,
about it. The postmaster assured
him at once that the letter would
be forthcoming in a moment, and
that his word would be quite enough
to identify it and ensure its being
returned to him. It seemed an age
to Raymond while the letters were
being turned out and sorted, but at
last the man held up the blank envelope,
with its queen’s head in the
corner, and exclaimed jubilantly:
“Here it is!”</p>

<p>The count seized it with avidity,
and hurried away, leaving the postmaster
half-amused, half-mystified,
at his excited volubility and warm
expressions of thanks. There was
no necessity to rush home at the
same pace that he had rushed out,
but Raymond felt like a machine
wound up to a pitch of velocity that
must be kept up until the wheel stopped
of its own accord. His hat was
drawn over his eyes, and his head
bent like a person walking on mechanically,
neither seeing nor hearing
what might be going on around
him. He was soon beyond the
streets and shop-windows, and
back amidst the fields and hedges.
There was a clatter of horses coming
down the road. M. de la Bourbonais
saw two gentlemen on horseback
approaching. He recognized
them, even in the distance, at a
glance: Sir Ponsonby Anwyll and
Mr. Charlton. Raymond’s heart
leaped up to his throat. What
would they do? Stop and speak,
or cut him dead? A few seconds
would decide. They were close on
him now, but showed no sign of
reining in to speak. Ponsonby
Anwyll raised his hat in a formal
salutation; Mr. Charlton looked
straight before him and rode on.
All the blood in his body seemed
to rush at the instant to Raymond’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_755" id="Page_755">[755]</a></span>
face. He put his hand to his forehead
and stood to steady himself;
then he walked home, never looking
to the right or the left until he
reached The Lilies.</p>

<p>Angélique called out from the
kitchen window to know if he had
made it right about the letter; but
he took no heed of her, only walked
in and went straight up to his
room. She heard him close the
door. There certainly was something
queer come to him of late.
What did he want, going to shut
himself in his bedroom this time
of day, and then passing her without
answering?</p>

<p>Franceline was in the study, busy
arranging some primroses and wild
violets that she had been gathering
under the hedge while her father
was out. A noise as of a body falling
heavily to the ground in the
room overhead made her drop the
flowers and fly up the stairs. Angélique
had hastened from the
kitchen to ask what was the matter;
but a loud shriek rang through
the house in answer to her question.</p>

<p>“Angélique, come! O my God!
Father! father!”</p>

<p>Raymond was lying prostrate on
the floor, insensible, while Franceline
lifted his head in her arms,
and kissed him and called to
him. “Oh! What has happened
to him? Father! father! speak
to me. O my God! is he dead?”
she cried, raising her pale, agonized
face to the old servant with a despairing
appeal.</p>

<p>“No! no! Calm thyself! He
has but fainted; he is not dead,”
said Angélique, feeling her master’s
pulse and heart. “See, put thy
hand here and feel! If he were
dead, it would not beat.”</p>

<p>Franceline laid her finger on the
pulse. She felt the feeble beat; it
was scarcely perceptible, but she
could feel it.</p>

<p>“We must lift him on to the
bed,” said Angélique, and she grasped
the slight form of her master
with those long, brown arms of hers,
and laid it gently on the bed, Franceline
assisting as she might.</p>

<p>“Now, my petite, thou wilt be
brave,” said the faithful creature,
forgetting herself in her anxiety
to spare and support Franceline.
“Thou wilt stay here and do what
is necessary whilst I run and fetch
the doctor.”</p>

<p>She poured some eau-de-cologne
into a basin of water, and desired
her to keep bathing her father’s
forehead and chafing his hands
until she returned. This, after loosing
his cravat and letting in as much
air as possible, was all her experience
suggested.</p>

<p>Franceline sat down and did as
she was told; but the perfect stillness,
the deathlike immobility of
the face and the form, terrified her.
She suspended the bathing to
breathe on it, as if her warm breath
might bring back consciousness
and prove more potent than the
cold water. But Raymond remained
insensible to all. The silence
began to oppress Franceline like a
ghastly presence; the cooing of her
doves outside sounded like a dirge.
Could this be death? His pulse
beat so faintly she hardly knew
whether it was his or the pulse of
her own trembling fingers that she
felt. A chill of horror came over
her; the first vague dread was
gradually shaping itself in her mind
to the most horrible of certainties.
If he should never awake, never
speak again, never open those closed
eyes on her with the old tender
glance of love that had been as
familiar and unfailing as the sunlight
to her! Oh! what a fearful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_756" id="Page_756">[756]</a></span>
awakening came with this first realization
of that awful possibility.
What vain shadows, what trivial
empty things, were those that she
had until now called sorrows!
What a joy it would be to take them
all back again, and bear them, increased
tenfold in bitterness, to the
end of her life, if this great, this real
sorrow might be averted! Franceline
dropped on her knees beside the
bed, and, clasping her hands, sent
up one of those cries that we all of
us find in our utmost need, when
there is only God who can help us:
“O Father! thy will be done.
But if it be possible, … if it
be possible, … let this cup
pass from me!”</p>

<p>There were steps on the stairs.
It was Angélique come back. She
had only been ten minutes away&mdash;the
longest ten minutes that ever a
trembling heart watched through&mdash;but
Franceline knew she could not
have been to the doctor’s and back
so quickly. “I met M. le Vicaire
just at the end of the lane, and he
is gone for the doctor; he was riding,
so he will be there in no time.”</p>

<p>Then she made Franceline go
and fetch hot water from the kitchen,
and busied her in many little
ways, under pretence of being useful,
until Dr. Blink’s carriage was
heard approaching. The medical
man was not alone; Mr. Langrove
and Father Henwick accompanied
him.</p>

<p>Angélique drew the young girl out
of her father’s room, and sent her
to stay with Father Henwick, while
the doctor, assisted by Mr. Langrove
and herself, attended to M.
de la Bourbonais.</p>

<p>“Oh! what is it? Did the doctor
tell you?” she whispered, her dark
eyes preternaturally dilated in their
tearless glance, as she raised it to
Father Henwick’s face.</p>

<p>“He could say nothing until he
had seen him. Tell me, my dear
child, did your father ever have
anything of this sort happen him
before?” inquired Father Henwick,
as unconcernedly as he could.</p>

<p>“Never, never that I heard of,
unless it may have been when
I was too little to remember,” said
Franceline; and then added nervously,
“Why?”</p>

<p>“Thank God! It is safe, then, not
to be so serious,” was the priest’s
hearty exclamation. “Please God,
you will see him all right again
soon; he has been overdoing of late,
working too hard, and not taking
air or exercise enough. The blade
has been wearing out the sheath&mdash;that’s
what it is; but Blink will
pull him through with God’s
help.”</p>

<p>“Father,” said Franceline, laying
both hands on his arm with an unconscious
movement that was very
expressive, “do you know it seems
to me as if I were only waking up,
only beginning to live now. Everything
has been unreal like a dream
until this. Is it a punishment for
being so ungrateful, so rebellious,
so blind to the blessings that I
had?”</p>

<p>“If it were, my child, punishment
with God is only another name
for mercy,” said Father Henwick.
“Our best blessings come to us
mostly in the shape of crosses.
Perhaps you were not thankful
enough for the great blessing of
your father’s love, for his health and
his delight in you; perhaps you let
your heart long too much for other
things; and if so, God has been
mindful of his foolish little one, and
has sent this touch of fear to teach
her to value more the mercies that
were vouchsafed to her, and not
to pine for those that were denied.
We seldom see things in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_757" id="Page_757">[757]</a></span>
true proportions until the shadow
of death falls on them.”</p>

<p>“The shadow of death!” echoed
Franceline, her white lips growing
still whiter. “Oh! if it be but the
shadow, my life will be too short
for thanksgiving, were I to live to
the end of the world.”</p>

<p>“Ha! here they come,” said
Father Henwick, opening the study-door
as he heard the doctor’s steps,
followed by Mr. Langrove’s, on the
stair.</p>

<p>Franceline went forward to meet
them; she did not speak, but Dr.
Blink held out his hand in answer
to her questioning face, and said
cheerfully: “The count is much
better; he has recovered consciousness,
and is doing very nicely, very
nicely indeed for the present.
Come! there is nothing to be
frightened at, my dear young lady.”</p>

<p>Franceline could not utter a word,
not even to murmur “Thank God!”
But the dead weight that had been
pressing on her heart was lifted,
she gasped for breath, and then the
blessed relief of tears came.</p>

<p>“My poor little thing! My poor
Franceline!” said the vicar, leading
her gently to a chair, and smoothing
the dark gold hair with paternal
kindness.</p>

<p>“Let her cry; it will do her good,”
said Dr. Blink kindly; and then he
turned to speak in a low voice to
Father Henwick and Mr. Langrove.</p>

<p>He had concluded, from the incoherent
account which Mr. Langrove
had gathered from Angélique,
that he should come prepared for a
case of apoplexy, and had brought
all that was necessary to afford immediate
relief. He had recourse
to bleeding in the first instance,
and it had proved effective. M. de
la Bourbonais was, as he said,
doing very well for the present.
Consciousness had returned, and
he was calm and free from suffering.
Franceline was too inexperienced
to understand where the real danger
of the attack lay. She fancied that,
since her father had regained consciousness,
there could be nothing
much worse than a bad fainting fit,
brought on by fatigue of mind and
body, and, now that the Rubicon
was past, he would soon be well,
and she would take extra care of
him, so as to prevent a relapse.
Her passionate burst of tears soon
calmed down, and she rose up to
thank her visitors with that queenly
self-command that formed so striking
a part of her character.</p>

<p>“I am very grateful to you for
coming so quickly; it was very
good of you,” she said, extending
her hand to Dr. Blink: “May I
go to him now?”</p>

<p>“No, no, not just yet,” he replied
promptly. “I would rather he
were left perfectly quiet for a few
hours. We will look in on him
later; not that it is necessary, but
we shall be in the neighborhood,
and may as well turn in for a moment.”
He wished them good-afternoon,
and was gone.</p>

<p>“And how did you happen to
come in just at the right moment?”
said Franceline, turning to Father
Henwick. “It did not occur to
me before how strange it was. Was
it some good angel that told you to
come to me, I wonder?”</p>

<p>“The very thing! You have
hit it to a nicety!” said Mr. Langrove.
“It was an angel that did
it.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Father Henwick,
falling into the vicar’s playful vein,
“and the odd thing was that he
came riding up to my house on a
fat Cumberland pony! Now, we all
know S. Michael has been seen on a
white charger, but this is the first
time, to my knowledge, that an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_758" id="Page_758">[758]</a></span>
angel was ever seen mounted on a
Cumberland pony.”</p>

<p>“Dear Mr. Langrove, how good
of you!” said Franceline, with
moistened eyes, and she pressed his
hand.</p>

<p>“Had you not better come out
with me now for a short walk?” said
the vicar. “I sha’n’t be more than
half an hour, and it will do you
good. Come and have early tea at
the vicarage, and we will walk
home with you before Blink comes
back. What do you say?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I think I had better not go
out, I feel so shaken and tired;
and then papa might ask for me,
you know. I shall not go near him
unless he does, after what Dr.
Blink said.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps it is as well for
you to keep quiet. Good-by, dear.
I will look in on you this evening.”</p>

<p>“And so will I, my child,” said
Father Henwick, laying his broad
hand on her head; and the two
gentlemen left the cottage together.</p>

<h3>THE FRIENDS OF EDUCATION.</h3>

<p>To pass from the discussion of
arguments to the question of motives
is a most common yet most
unjustifiable manœuvre of popular
debate. This is usually done when
the field of calm and logical reasoning
has become tolerably clear.
The flank movement is attempted
as a final struggle against defeat
otherwise inevitable. If the motive
thus impugned be really indefensible;
if it be, at the same time,
glaring or manifest, a positive advantage
is sometimes gained by a
vigorous diversion from the real
object of contention. But if such
a motive has to be alleged&mdash;or, still
worse, invented&mdash;the demonstration
against it, however violent, is but a
reluctant and ungracious acknowledgment
of defeat and a flight
from the real point at issue. The
most recent instance of this sort is
taking place before the American
public, and has been afforded by
those who endeavor to represent
Catholics as opposed to free and
liberal education, thereby attainting
the motives of the position
which Catholics have been forced
to assume with regard to what are
falsely called “common” schools.</p>

<p>This attitude of our opponents,
however, we regard not without
complacency. Our object is not
war, but peace and good-will
among citizens. We hail the present
violent misrepresentation as a
sign that the enemy is close to the
“last ditch,” and that the discussion
approaches its conclusion.
When this final effort to distort
the Catholic object and to asperse
the Catholic character has exhausted
itself and been held up to the
inspection of the American people,
we shall have seen the end of the
“school question.” We insist upon
an improvement in our educational
system which is necessary to
perfect its character and to satisfy
the requirements of the times.
The present system does not meet
the wishes of a very large portion
of the community, is unfair to
others besides Catholics, and is out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_759" id="Page_759">[759]</a></span>
of harmony with the spirit of free
institutions. A system is wanted
which shall at least be equal to
that of monarchical countries, fair
to all citizens alike, and which will
relieve Catholics from the double
burden of educating their own
children, besides paying for a system
of education of which they
cannot conscientiously avail themselves.</p>

<p>The correctness of the Catholic
position is so manifest, and is so
rapidly gaining the recognition of
all thoughtful classes, that those
who are unwilling to allow Catholics
equal rights as citizens are
forced, in order to hide the truth,
not only to maintain that the present
system is absolutely perfect and
incapable of any improvement, but
to accuse Catholics of harboring
ideas of which they are not only
innocent, but which it would be
wholly impossible for them to entertain&mdash;such
as that they are
afraid of the light; that they attack
the present system because
they are inimical to all education;
and that their object is, if possible,
to do away with it altogether. Accusations
similar to these are daily
repeated, garnished with rhetoric,
and sent forth to alarm our fellow-citizens
and to encourage them to
turn a deaf ear to whatever Catholics
may say. The weak point of
this movement against us is that
the people will notice that it does
not deal at all with the validity of
Catholic claims, and that it shirks
the only question at issue. They
will be led to suspect that it is emphatically
a “dodge”; and the
mere suspicion of this will awaken
curiosity as to what Catholics
really have to say&mdash;a curiosity fatal
to the success of the flank attack.</p>

<p>In the language of those who
advance the charge with which we
propose to deal, education means
either primary instruction in the
elements of knowledge, or else
higher academic culture, such as
is to be furnished by colleges and
universities. If, therefore, Catholics
are hostile to education, in this
sense of the word, they must be
opposed either to the general
spread of such information as is
aimed at in elementary and normal
schools, or to the existence and
growth of the higher institutions
of science and art.</p>

<p>We are perfectly aware that there
is another meaning given to the
word education, to which reference
is made, simply in order to avoid
obscurity.</p>

<p>Philosophers of the class to
which Mr. Huxley belongs understand
by education a certain specific
course of moral and intellectual
training, the aim of which is to ensure
its pupils against ever being
affected by “theological tendencies.”
Such impressions are to
be made upon childhood, and matured
in more advanced stages, as
will rid men of that natural but
awkward habit of reasoning from
cause to effect; which will free
them from all hope of any life but
the present, and any fear of future
responsibility, in order that they
may be impelled to devote themselves
solely to the analysis and
classification of material phenomena,
since this is the only purpose
of man’s existence&mdash;such a course
of spiritual defloration as was practised
upon the tender and noble genius
of the late John Stuart Mill, the
results of which, as manifested by
the revelation of his biography, afford,
in the words of an ingenuous,
critic, “a most unpleasant spectacle.”
A process of this kind is
not education; it is a heartrending
and lamentable destruction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_760" id="Page_760">[760]</a></span>
that which is noblest and most essential
in man, and as a definition
has not yet obtained a place in the
English language.</p>

<p>If any of our readers would care
to know our own ultimate definition
of education, we should describe
it as the complete and harmonious
development of all the
powers of man in reference to his
true end. But for present purposes
it is sufficient to adopt the
ordinary sense of the word, as
meaning the diffusion of knowledge
by scholastic exercises in academies
and colleges.</p>

<p>If it appears singular to enlightened
Protestants to hear a demand
for circumscription and discouragement
of Catholics, and, if possible,
the suppression of religious education,
from that faction whose motto
is “Liberty and Light,” we trust
that it will seem none the less paradoxical
to hear the charge of favoring
ignorance urged with most vehemence
against us by those whose
boast, up to within a few years, has
been “a ministry without education,
and a way to heaven without
grammar.”</p>

<p>The first demand does not in the
least surprise us, coming, as it does,
from a crude and undigested assumption
of the principles of European
radicalism. We have seen
its consistency illustrated by madmen
chasing, robbing, and killing
one another to the cry of “liberty,
equality, fraternity.” We understand
what it is to be assaulted by
this party, which knows not how to
act except in the way of destruction,
which is never at rest except in the
midst of agitation, and never at
peace, so to speak, except when at
war.</p>

<p>Nor is it strange to see an attempt
against Catholics made outside
the field of theological controversy,
inasmuch as the result of
controversy for the past two centuries
has tended rather to the disintegration
of Protestantism than to
the conversion of Catholics to the
new faith. Nor is it surprising to
find this assault directed against
the equal rights of Catholics in
education; for here some earnest
but short-sighted men imagine that
there is not simply ground to be
gained, but that the present system
is a stronghold not to be given up.
It is a stronghold, truly, but rather
of infidelity than of Protestantism.</p>

<p>But educated Protestants and
heathen will marvel with us that
the attack has been made on the
theory that Protestantism is the
born friend, and Catholicity the
natural enemy of education, knowing
as well as we the fatal evidence
of history.</p>

<p>The contempt for education
which, until more recent times,
has always existed, to a certain
extent, among the orthodox Protestants,
was founded upon their
erroneous doctrines of the total
depravity of human nature, the
consequent invalidity of human
reason, and the principle of private
illumination.</p>

<p>When Luther said, “The god Moloch,
to whom the Jews immolated
their children, is to-day represented
by the universities” (<cite>Wider den
Missbrauch der Messe</cite>), it was not
simply on the ground of the universities
being centres of association
for boisterous and disorderly
youth, or fortresses of the ancient
faith, but because of that “pagan
and impious science” which was
taught in them.</p>

<p>In his furious onslaught against
them Luther was sustained by his
well-known hatred of anything
which tended to assert the prerogatives
of human nature or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_761" id="Page_761">[761]</a></span>
dignity of reason. No man was
ever more intemperate in denunciation
than this so-called “liberator
of humanity and emancipator of
human reason.” “True believers
strangle reason,” said he; and he
never alluded to it except in terms
of most outrageous abuse. The
last sermon of his at Wittenberg<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>
is monumental in this respect;
and his well-known reply to the
Anabaptists is one of the most
startling examples of his intensely
idiomatic style.<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>The feelings of the master were
fully communicated to the disciples.
The results were fearful. The free
schools which existed in every city
were overturned by the very men
whom they had educated; the <i lang="de">gymnasia</i>
were in many places wholly destroyed,
in others so reduced as never
to recover their former position.</p>

<p>At Wittenberg itself the two
preachers, Spohr and Gabriel Didymus,
announced from the pulpit that
the study of science was not simply
useless but noxious, and that it was
best to do away with the colleges and
schools. The upshot was to change
the academy of that city into a bakery.
Similar measures were carried
into effect throughout the entire
duchy of Anspach. The history
of the Reformation by Dr. Döllinger
gives a long list of the numerous
scholars, rectors of high schools and
colleges, who were driven into exile, and
also details a minute account
of many of the institutions which
were destroyed.</p>

<p>The statements of Erasmus, as to
the disastrous results of the Reformation
on studies, are constant and
numberless. They may be formulated
in a sentence of one of his
letters to Pirkheimer (1538): “<i lang="la">Ubicumque
regnat Lutheranismus, ibi
litterarum est interitus</i>”&mdash;“Wherever
Lutheranism reigns, there is the destruction
of letters.”</p>

<p>The testimony of Sturm, Schickfuss,
Bucer, and others is no less
forcible. Luther and Melancthon
in later days seem to have been appalled
by their own work, and
George Major thus sums up the
melancholy condition of things in
his own day: “Thanks to the wickedness
of men and the contempt
which we ourselves have shown for
studies, the schools have more than
ever need of patrons and protectors
to save them from ruin, and to prevent
us from falling into a state of
barbarism worse than that of Turks
and Muscovites.”</p>

<p>The interesting works of the Benedictines
of St. Maur of the XVIIIth
century, the Bollandists, and the
collections of a few other Catholic
scholars have preserved nearly all
the material that is left from which
to construct the history of the middle
ages, so thorough was the work
of destruction done on libraries
by the Calvinists and Huguenots.
The Bodleian library is but a fragment&mdash;a
few torn leaves of the literature
which was weeded out of
England by the enlightened zeal of
the much-married father of Anglicanism.</p>

<p>“What mad work this Dr. Coxe
did in Oxon, while he sat chancellor,
by being the chief man that
worked a reformation there, I have
elsewhere told you,” says Anthony
Wood “To return at length to
the royal delegates, some of whom
yet remained in Oxford, doing such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_762" id="Page_762">[762]</a></span>
things as did not at all become
those who professed to be learned
and Christian men. For the principal
ornaments, and at the same
time supports, of the university&mdash;that
is, the libraries, filled with innumerable
works, both native and foreign&mdash;they
permitted or directed to
be despoiled.… Works of
scholastic theology were sold off
among those exercising the lowest
description of arts; and those
which contained circles or diagrams
it was thought good to mutilate or
burn, as containing certain proof
of the magical nature of their contents.”</p>

<p>What was left undone by the
royal delegates was thoroughly attended
to by the Puritans, who never
did their work by halves, and
whose views with regard to the
Bible and literature bore a close
resemblance to those of the early
Mohammedans in their comparative
estimate of the Koran and secular
writings.</p>

<p>For a full account of the effect
of the revolution of the XVIth century
on learning, people who may
suspect Catholic writers of exaggeration
can compare their statements
with those of the learned Protestant
Huber, in his exhaustive history of
the universities. Even “honest
Latimer,” who certainly was not a
zealot for profane learning, lifted up
his voice in complaint: “It would
pity a man’s heart to hear that
that I hear of the state of Cambridge;
what it is in Oxford I cannot
tell.” How it was at Oxford
we have already seen. Throughout
the length and breadth of the land
the monastic schools, which were
asylums both of mercy and learning,
were destroyed; the mere list of
their names, as given by the Protestant
historian Cobbett, occupies one
hundred and forty-five pages of his
work. The present condition of the
lower classes in England, which is
due to their being thus deprived of
means of education and assistance
in distress, is the Nemesis of the Reformation.
In listening to the demand
that the government shall dispossess
the present landlords as it
despoiled the churchmen of old, we
hear arguments of fearful power as
to the extent of eminent domain.
When it is asked why the crown and
people shall not exercise for the
common good the prerogative which
was conceded and exercised formerly
for the benefit of the crown alone,
the present holders of property acquired
by sacrilege may well take
alarm at the progress of revolutionary
ideas. And the question as to
how far the people were forcibly
deprived of the benefits of a trust
vested for them in the church, may
be decided “without constitutional
authority and through blood.”
God avert such a calamity from England!
May the prayers of Catholic
martyrs, of More and Fisher, intercede
in her behalf, and save her from
the consequences of that act, to prevent
which, these, her truest sons, did
not hesitate to offer up their lives!
However, with these facts in view,
it is scarcely wise for English Protestantism
to assume the position
of a necessary and perpetual friend
of popular education. It is best to
wait until the ink has become dry
which has scored from the statute
book of that realm the law making
it felony to teach the alphabet to
Catholics.</p>

<p>It would be gratifying to us to contrast
with the conduct of the authors
of Protestantism that of the great
educators of Europe who laid the
foundations of our civilization. A
fierce and violent revolution has
turned that civilization aside, and
introduced into it principles of anarchy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_763" id="Page_763">[763]</a></span>
and death. A shallow and
ungrateful era has failed to perceive
and to acknowledge its debts. It
is only in the pages of scholars such
as Montalembert, the Protestants
Maitland and Huber, and the author
of that recent modest but
most charming book entitled <cite>Christian
Schools and Scholars</cite>, that we
begin to notice a thoughtful inquiry
into the history of our intellectual
development. The masters slumber
in forgetfulness and oblivion.
We know not the builders of the
great structures of the middle ages;
and people generally know almost
as little of its great intellectual and
social system. The history of the
human race for a thousand years
of most intense activity is summed
up in a few unmeaning words.</p>

<p>Time and space fail for such a
comparison. But the fact that the
first Protestants found themselves
educated, the fact that they found
schools to denounce and to destroy,
in the XVIth century, is sufficient
to justify us with regard to history
prior to that date.</p>

<p>It would also be a pleasure to
describe the progress of those magnificent
bodies of Catholic educators
which rose, under divine inspiration,
as a check to the wave of revolution,
and whose successes first
stimulated the action of Protestants
by the wholesome influence of fear.
But this also is beyond our compass.
We are ready to discuss the
charge that Catholics are opposed
to education, independently of all
reference to Protestantism, by the
test of positive facts, and to stand
or fall by the Catholic record in
modern times.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to cross the
ocean or to visit countries where
the munificence of ages has endowed
the universities of Catholic lands;
as, for instance, the seven great
universities of the Papal States&mdash;Ferrara,
Bologna, Urbino, Macerata,
Camerino, Perugia, and Rome,
each containing thousands of students.
Nor is it necessary to remind
the reader that the great Protestant
universities, and notably
those of England, are, to use the
expression of a distinguished Anglican
prelate, “a legacy of Catholicism.”
The charge that Catholics
are opposed to university education
is simply laughable, considering
that the university is essentially a
Catholic idea, and has never, even
in Europe, been successfully counterfeited.</p>

<p>It is not necessary, although it
may be instructive, to refer to the
free schools of the city of Rome,
which, according to the testimony
of a Protestant traveller, thirty
years ago surpassed even those of
Berlin in efficiency and relative
number. They were, before the recent
seizure by the Piedmontese
government, the most numerous in
proportion to the population and
the most varied in character of any
city in the world. They presented
to their scholars the choice of day
or night with regard to time, and
prepared them for every profession,
art, and trade. This matchless
variety was doubtless the result of
centuries of growth; but it was
also the spontaneous outcome of
zeal for education, and laid not a
penny of taxation upon the people.
So high was the standard of
gratuitous education that private
schools, at the beginning of the
reign of our Holy Father Pius IX.,
had to struggle hard in order to
retain the patronage of the wealthy
classes. At that time there were
in Rome 27 institutions and 387
schools for free education. Of
these last, 180 were for little children
of both sexes. Of the remainder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_764" id="Page_764">[764]</a></span>
94 were devoted to males and
113 to females. The total number
of pupils in elementary schools
amounted to 14,157, of which
number 3,790 were of the infant
class. Of those more advanced,
5,544 were males and 4,823 females.
In elementary schools, <em>purely gratuitous</em>,
7,579 received education&mdash;viz.,
3,952 boys and 3,627 girls.</p>

<p>There appears, however, in Cardinal
Morichini’s report, a feature
which has never yet been introduced
into the American system&mdash;to
wit, in <em>schools paying a small pension</em>
there were 1,592 boys and
1,196 girls; making a total in such
schools of 2,788. This last item
may furnish a hint to those who are
anxious to secure the attendance
of poor children in our own schools;
although it is scarcely practicable
where common education has to
be provided by taxation alone. Of
these 387 schools to which we have
referred, 26 belonged to religious
communities of men, and 23 to religious
communities of women.
The rest belonged to, or were conducted
by, seculars. Besides these,
2,213 children of both sexes received
free instruction in special conservatories.</p>

<p>In addition to this system of free
primary education, there was the
vast system of colleges and academies
connected with the university,
the advantages of which were at the
command of the most limited and
humble means.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to ask
some of the high-school graduates
in this country the simple historical
question, “Who, in modern
times; have done most for free education?”
General Grant has doubtlessly
contributed liberally towards
it; so, it is to be presumed, has Mr.
Blaine; so have many other distinguished
lecturers on the subject of
education. But if the question is
rightly answered, the date will have
to be assigned much earlier, and
St. Joseph Calasanctius, Venerable
de la Salle, Catherine McAuley,
and a hundred thousand other
“Papists” will have to take precedence
of our illustrious fellow-citizens.
The spectacle of one Christian
Brother, or Ursuline Nun, or
Sister of Mercy whose life is devoted
to the instruction of the poor,
with no recompense but the sweet
privilege of being worn out in the
service of fellow-men for the sake
of Jesus Christ&mdash;such a spectacle
as was afforded by the gifted Gerald
Griffin, or by Mother Seton in
our own country, and is daily
shown among us by thousands of
calm, intelligent men and amiable
women, in the various religious orders&mdash;this
is a testimony to education
which none but Catholics
can produce. And yet these men
and women, these bright martyrs
of charity, are they whom it is
thought good to attack by every
means within the reach of calumny.</p>

<p>Let it be understood that we do
not overlook the efforts made by
noble men and women in the ranks
of Protestantism. Though few,
and insignificant in intensity of
zeal when compared with the
daily and common sacrifices made
by Catholics, nevertheless it must
be borne in mind that these isolated
attempts have been ineffectual,
save only in so far as they have
produced imperfect copies of the
great works of Catholicity. Protestantism,
as such, has never
prompted or organized any great
attempt at general free primary
education. Indeed, it might be
safely challenged to produce any
instance of the kind. And if the
American people to-day were to be
seized with remorse for its injustice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_765" id="Page_765">[765]</a></span>
towards Catholics, and to propose
immediately to do away with all
public schools, we should object
most strongly on the ground that
no adequate means would then exist
for the education of Protestant
children. The problem of general
education has never been faced by
Protestantism. The system of godless
education is an extremely modern
and thoroughly pagan idea.
If it has found favor among the
leaders of Protestantism, this has
been because they have accepted it
as a solution of the educational
problem; not having given the
matter sufficient attention to observe
the ruinous effect which it is
producing on themselves.</p>

<p>From similar thoughtlessness
comes their maintenance of the
present system. It is a comparatively
cheap solution, as far as individuals
are concerned. It calls
for no sacrifices. It is supposed to
be sufficiently Protestant as long
as the Bible is read in the schools.
But if the present movement of
the infidel party succeeds, and the
“common” schools are reduced to
purely irreligious institutions, the
matter will soon force itself upon
Protestant attention. We are convinced
that they will perceive that
Catholics have given the subject
much more consideration than
they supposed, and have been
right throughout. Many of them
will regret having misunderstood
our views, and will be prepared
to endorse the proposition that
such schools are subversive of
Christianity and demoralizing in
their tendency. They will then endeavor
to repair the evils which
may still result from their ill-judged
neglect of Catholic remonstrance.
They will demand to be put upon
at least an equal footing with infidels,
probably with as much vehemence
as Catholics have demanded
an equal footing for all citizens
alike. If they find themselves
hopelessly debarred from this by
the radical changes in the constitution
which some of their number
are even now proposing, they
will impeach these amendments.
This failing, they will find themselves
in the position in which Catholics
now are. Then, for the
first time in history, will Protestantism
have a fair chance to show
how much it cares for education.</p>

<p>But, as already intimated, it is not
necessary to cross the seas to discover
testimony in rebuttal of the
gratuitous slander which is urged
against Catholics. Nor is there
need to summon from the tomb the
teachers of those who founded the
so-called Reformation, nor to institute
an historic comparison between
the labors of Catholics and
Protestants. Still less need is there
to attempt to penetrate the future
as to what Catholics may do for
education when they are relieved
of one-half of their present twofold
burden.</p>

<p>We live in the XIXth century
and in America; and in this, very
age and country Catholics are doing
more for education than is actually
done by any other denomination,
and, in proportion to their numbers
and means, more than is done by
all other denominations put together,
which outnumber Catholics
by at least four to one&mdash;Catholics,
forsooth, who are impudently charged
with being opposed to primary
schools and collegiate training!</p>

<p>This assertion will doubtless
sound strangely in the ears of those
who have allowed themselves to
remain in ignorance of the facts
which we shall presently adduce.
But, in view of them, it will be acknowledged
that our statement is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_766" id="Page_766">[766]</a></span>
the most modest that can be made,
and that, if disposed to be boastful,
we could increase it many fold without
fear of exaggeration. Catholics
in this country have, it is true, no
great university such as those produced
by the efforts and endowments
of generations. Besides the
lack of time necessary for such a
development, two other causes have
thus far prevented its origin. The
first is the poverty of Catholics
here&mdash;not simply their lack of
means&mdash;but the fact that the extent
of the country and the comparatively
small number of very
wealthy families require that educational
institutions of the higher
class should be plentifully distributed.
Secondly, Catholic resources
have actually been applied to satisfy
this condition of things. We feel
quite sanguine that, before the
close of the century, in spite of all
disadvantages, a Catholic university
of the very highest character will
be established here; but, without
it, there exist at present, in every
city of importance throughout the
Union, colleges which, for scholarship,
will fairly compete with the
chartered universities of this country,
and which, in certain localities
and in special departments, will
surpass their older and more pretentious
rivals. Although these
colleges do not approach the ideal
of a university&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, a great city of
learning, which can no more be
built in a day than a great commercial
metropolis&mdash;nevertheless
there is no reason to be ashamed
of our colleges. Scarcely one of
them can be found which does not
contain the children of non-Catholics,
sent thither by the preference
of parents and guardians. Our
great academies for young ladies
are recognized as possessing advantages
which are without a parallel;
and, as a class, the convent schools
for girls are without even a rival,
and contain a very large proportion
of Protestant children.</p>

<p>Nor are Catholics lacking in
efforts to provide primary education
for Catholic children, although
their efforts in this direction are
sadly out of proportion to their
necessities. In higher intellectual
culture the wealthy are naturally
interested. They must provide
suitable education for their children.
To do this in every place
is a most severe tax upon them.
Nevertheless, it has been their duty
to accomplish this, and, at the same
time, to subscribe liberally toward
the education of the children of
their poorer brethren.</p>

<p>The poorer classes, also, with
less natural impulse to make sacrifices
for education, exposed to
the temptation of hundreds of proselytizing
institutions, forced to pay
also for the lavish expenditure of
the public schools, have had to bear
the burden of procuring the necessary
instruction for their children
without exposing them to sectarianism
and the scorn of their religion
too often openly manifested in
the “common” schools. How far
they have done their duty will presently
be shown. Honorable men
shall judge whether they have or
have not valued education. But
if it be suddenly discovered that
they have valued it, let it be acknowledged
also that they have acted
as Catholics and from the deepest
religious motives.</p>

<p>The general statistics of the
Catholic Church in America are
very imperfect. Nevertheless, from
the <cite>Catholic Directory</cite> of 1875 a
few figures may be gleaned which
will abundantly sustain the statements
here advanced. It is to
be regretted that the statistics as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_767" id="Page_767">[767]</a></span>
given in the <cite>Directory</cite> are not more
complete, those of some dioceses
being quite minute and exact, those
of others very imperfect.</p>

<p>With regard to colleges and
academies for higher education,
there are, under Catholic direction,
in the United States, at least 540,
with an attendance of not less than
48,000 pupils. In dioceses of
which both the numbers of institutions
and their attendance have
been given there are 270 institutions,
with an attendance of 24,000.
A mathematical computation
gives for the attendance in the
others the amount which we have
allowed as a safe estimate&mdash;viz., a
total attendance of no less than
48,000 souls. How does this appear
to those who have listened
hitherto to the revilers of Catholics?
Are we right in repelling their
charge, or are they right, who have
nothing but their angry feelings
with which to sustain it?</p>

<p>If Catholics are wanting in zeal
for education, the spirit of obstruction
is not apparent in their higher
institutions. But, as we have said,
the mass of our people are poor.
What provision have they made for
themselves, besides paying for the
education of others?</p>

<p>The Catholic parochial schools
are principally designed to supply
the need of Catholic education for
the masses. It would be wrong,
however, to consider them as merely
primary schools. Many of the
parochial schools are really high
schools, and have a course of
studies equal to the best normal
schools. Nevertheless, under the
head of parish schools are not included
any of those already mentioned
as colleges or academies.
In the Archdiocese of Cincinnati
there are 140 parish schools, in
which are educated about 35,000
children free of cost to the State.
In the Archdiocese of New York
there are 93 parish schools, with not
less than 37,600 children. In the
Diocese of Cleveland there are 100
parish schools and 16,000 children.
In some places the attendance of
the Catholic schools is fully equal
to that of the public schools. So that
in these districts Catholics not only
pay for the education of their own
children, but half the expenses of
the public schools, and&mdash;supposing
both systems to be conducted with
equal economy&mdash;enough to pay for
the education of all the other children
as well as their own, <em>free of
cost</em> to Protestants, Jews, and infidels.
And yet Catholics are charged
with being hostile to education!</p>

<p>In the United States we have
statistics of 1,400 parochial schools,
the given attendance at which
amounts to 320,000 pupils. The
entire number of parish schools
foots up 1,700, and the total figure
of attendance may be set down at
400,000 scholars. Add to this the
number of 48,000 who are being
educated in colleges and academies,
and farther increase the sum by the
probable number of children in
asylums, reformatories, and industrial
schools, and there will appear
something very like half a million
of scholars who are receiving their
education at the expense of Catholics.</p>

<p>Taking into account Catholic
numbers, Catholic means, and the
time in which Catholics have made
these provisions for education, we
can safely challenge, not only every
denomination singly, but all of
them put together, to show any
corresponding interest in the matter
of education, whether elementary
or scientific. This challenge is
made, not in the spirit of pride
(though certainly without shame),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_768" id="Page_768">[768]</a></span>
but in the name of truth and of
generous rivalry to outstrip all
others in the service of humanity
and our country. Let it stand as
the fittest reply to the disingenuous
charge that Catholics are opposed
to education.</p>

<p>The candid reader to whom
these facts are new will use his
own language in characterizing the
“flank movement” against Catholics,
and will be disposed to credit
us with honesty and consistency in
our open criticism of the present
hastily-adopted system of education.
But we are persuaded that
he will also be led, if not to make,
at least to concur in, farther reflections
on the facts which are here
adduced. If Catholics are actually
providing instruction for so vast
a number of the people of the
United States, is not this a very
considerable saving to the public?
We think it is. The average cost
of education in New York City is
$13 60 per child; in the State of
New York, $11; in the United
States and Territories, $9 26. The
saving represented by such a number
in our schools amounts, at the
rate of New York City, to $6,800,000;
at the rate of the State of New York,
to $5,500,000, and at the lowest
rate, to $4,630,000 per annum. In
addition to this direct saving, we
must be credited with the amount
of our taxes for the public schools.
When Catholics stand before the
American people, and state the reasons
why they do not consider the
present educational system that prevails
here to be either wise or just,
they are not beggars in any sense.
They ask for no favor. They demand
an equitable system of disbursing
the funds raised for education, so
that no class of citizens shall be
deprived of that for which they are
forced to contribute. They would
arrange it so that none could justly
complain. As Catholics, we
must have religion and morality
(which, whatever others may think,
are to us inseparable) taught in the
schools to which we send our children.
No time or place will ever
alter our convictions on this point.
What we demand for ourselves we
gladly concede to others. We are
ready to consult with them on a
common and just basis of agreement.
Nothing is wanting for a
harmonious settlement except fairness
on the part of our opponents.
There is no flaw in our position, no
evil design in our heart, nor have
we the slightest disposition to drive
a close bargain. Let the word be
spoken. Let any of the Protestant
denominations make a step forward,
intimate a desire for settlement
on the basis of equal justice
to all, and Catholics are with them.
But while we thus maintain our demand
as strictly just, whether it be
received or rejected, we are not
debtors but creditors of the state.
We not only ask our fellow-citizens,
Will you stand by and see
us taxed for a system of education
of which we cannot conscientiously
avail ourselves? but we further
ask, Can you, as honest men, disregard
what Catholics are doing
for education? Do you want them
not only to educate their own children,
thereby saving you this cost,
but to educate yours also?</p>

<p>What kind of a soul has the man
or the nation who would deliberately
resist such an appeal? The
time will come when people will
ask&mdash;as, indeed, many do ask at present&mdash;“Why
is not a louder outcry
made for the Catholics in the
school question?” And the answer
is that we feel a certainty,
which nothing can shake, that the
American people are intelligent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_769" id="Page_769">[769]</a></span>
enough to understand Catholics after
a time; and when they do understand
them, they will be fair
enough to do them justice.</p>

<p>In the meantime let the Catholic
laborer pay not only for the education
of his own children at the
parish school, and save this expense
to his rich neighbor; let him
also pay for the same neighbor’s
children, not merely in primary
schools, but in high schools, where
ladies and gentlemen (whom poverty
does not drive to labor at the
age when the poor man’s children
have to be apprenticed) may learn
French and German and music,
and to declaim on the glorious
principles of American liberty and
of the Constitution, under which
all men are (supposed to be) free
and equal. We love to hear their
young voices and hearty eloquence.
Let these institutions be costly in
structure and furnished with every
improvement. Let the teachers
have high salaries. Let gushing editors
issue forth, to manifest to the
astonished world the wisdom and
deep thought which they have acquired
at the expense of their
humbler and self-sacrificing neighbor.
But let honest and thoughtful
men ponder on the meaning of
American equality, and judge who
are the true friends of education.
The wages of the laborers will be
spent, if the shallowness and crude
imperfection of the present system
are learned, and the spirit of equal
rights among citizens peacefully
preserved; though the credit will
belong to those who have kept
their calmness of mind and made
the greatest sacrifices.</p>

<p>The candid reader to whom we
have alluded will readily admit
that Catholics are true friends of
education, and are doing most for
it proportionately to their means;
that, instead of suspicion and
abuse, they deserve respect, honor,
and acknowledgment of their services.</p>

<p>We think, however, that our fellow-citizens
will go much farther,
and will, in time, endorse our statement
when we affirm that Catholics
at present, and as a body, are the
only true friends of popular education.
By this is not meant simply
to say that they have not been backward
in obtaining, by their intelligence
and integrity, the highest
positions in the country; that they
count as representatives such men
as Chief-Justice Taney, Charles
O’Conor, a Barry at the head of
the navy, a Sheridan and a Rosecrans
in the army, and others of
the highest national and local
reputation; or that, when the Roman
purple fell upon the shoulders
of the Archbishop of New York,
it suffered no loss of dignity in
touching a true and patriotic
American, well fitted to wear it in
any court or academy of Europe.
But we do mean that, outside of
the Catholic Church and those who
sympathize with our views on this
subject, there is no body whose
representatives are not biassed in
their plan for common education
by prejudice or hostility toward
some other body.</p>

<p>With what utter disregard for
the rights of conscience the infidel
and atheistic faction coolly avows
its purpose to enforce a secular
and irreligious education upon all
the people&mdash;a system known to be
no less antagonistic to the spirit of
our democratic institutions than
hostile to the religious convictions
of Catholics as well as Protestants!
What loud outcries and stormy denunciations
echo from certain popular
pulpits when this faction demands
the expulsion of the Bible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_770" id="Page_770">[770]</a></span>
from the public schools! Is any
person cool in the midst of this confusion?
Is there any class of citizens
which looks to the common
good and adheres to the principle
of equal regard for religious rights
and education free for all? There
are such persons. There is such a
class. Those are they who never
shrink from avowing their principles,
and whose principles are always
right, in spite of temporary
unpopularity&mdash;the representatives
of the Catholic Church of America.</p>

<p>When the excitement of the hour
has died away, and the schemes of
politicians to gain power by fastening
upon the country a system fatal
to liberty, and radical in its assault
upon the spirit of our government,
have met their just fate, then we
shall receive the honor due to those
who have defended the country
from the danger of adopting partisan
measures aimed against a certain
class of citizens.</p>

<p>We hope to live to see the day
when there will not be a child in
the whole land capable of instruction
who shall not receive a
thorough education, fitting him
to be a patriotic citizen of our
country, and, at the same time, in
nowise interfering with his religious
duties. The present system
signally fails to accomplish this.
Those who so strenuously uphold
its organization and attempt to make
it compulsory upon all are hostile
to the genius of our institutions
and fanatical in their zeal. That
they are not lovers of education is
evident from their own ignorance
of facts. That they are in earnest
when they charge Catholics with
hostility to education we can
scarcely believe; for we hear from
the same lips hints and warnings
against Catholic success in education.
We hear also that the Catholic
Church is growing, and, unless
something is done to stop her, she
will convert all the Protestants in
the country; and, still at other
times, that she is an effete and
worn-out thing which cannot live
through the century in a free republic.
At one time Catholics are
derided as idiots; at another represented
as deep and insidious conspirators.
There is scarcely anything
which is not affirmed or denied
of them, according as it suits
the mood of their revilers. If our
people were cooler and more dispassionate,
we should find all those
calumnies answering one another.
As it is, we are constrained to
pay them more or less attention,
though the nature of the testimony
against us scarcely allows us to
take up more than one point at a
time.</p>

<p>If Catholics or Methodists or
Episcopalians or Baptists can give a
better and a cheaper education, we
see no reason why the state should
interfere with those who choose to
avail themselves of it. Let the
state set up any standard it may
choose, or make it obligatory; Catholics
will cheerfully come up to
it, no matter how high it may be,
provided equal rights are allowed
to all. The government has a right
to demand that its voters shall possess
knowledge. It has no right to
say how or where they shall acquire
knowledge. The government
is bound by public policy to promote
education. This is to be
done by stimulating in this department
the same activity which has
made Americans famous in other
branches of social economy, by encouraging
spontaneous action, and
not by an ill-judged system of
“protection” of one kind of education
against another, or by creating
a state monopoly. Bespeaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_771" id="Page_771">[771]</a></span>
candor and due respect on the part
of those who may differ from us,
we take our stand on what we conceive
to be the true American
ground, and are willing to abide by
the consequences&mdash;fair play, universal
culture, obligatory knowledge,
non-interference of the state
in religion, and free trade in education.</p>

<h3>SIR THOMAS MORE.<br />
<i>A HISTORICAL ROMANCE.</i></h3>

<p class="center">FROM THE FRENCH OF THE PRINCESSE DE CRAON.</p>

<h4>V.</h4>

<p>Time glides rapidly by, leaving
no footprints on the dreary road
over which it has passed, as the
wild billows, rolling back into the
fathomless depths whence the tempest
has called them forth, leave no
traces behind them. And so passes
life&mdash;fleeting rapidly, noiselessly
away; while man, weary with striving,
tortured by cares and unceasing
anxieties, is born, suffers, weeps,
and in a day has withered, and,
like a fragile flower of the field,
perishes from the earth.</p>

<p>Wolsey, fallen from the summit of
prosperity, continued to experience
a succession of reverses. Unceasingly
exposed to the malice of his
enemies, he struggled in vain against
their constantly-increasing influence;
and if they failed in bringing
about his death, they succeeded, at
least, in poisoning every moment
of his existence. Thus, at the time
even when Henry VIII. had sent
him a valuable ring as a token of
amity, they forced the king to despoil
the wretched man of the valuable
possessions which they pretended
to wish restored to him. He received
one day from his master a
new assurance of his royal solicitude;
the next, his resources failing,
he was obliged, for want of money,
to dismiss his old servants and remain
alone in his exile.</p>

<p>Cromwell, with an incredible
adroitness, had succeeded by degrees
in disengaging himself from
the obligations he owed the cardinal,
and in making the downfall
and misfortunes of his master serve
to advance his own interests. He
had made numerous friends among
the throng of courtiers surrounding
the king, in obtaining from the unhappy
Wolsey his recognition of
the distribution which the king had
made of his effects, by adding the
sanction of his own seal. After
repeated refusals on the part of the
cardinal, he was at last successful
in convincing him of the urgent
necessity for making this concession,
in order to try, he said with
apparent sincerity, to lessen the
animosity and remove the prejudices
they entertained against him.
But, in reality, the intention of
Cromwell had been, by that manœuvre,
to strip him of his entire possessions;
for the courtiers, being
well aware their titles were not valid
under the law, were every moment
afraid they might be called on
to surrender the gifts they had received,
and consequently desired
nothing so much as to have the
cardinal confirm them in their unjust
possessions.</p>

<p>It was by means of this monstrous
ingratitude that Cromwell purchased
the favor of the court, began to
elevate himself near the king in receiving
new dignities and honors,
and at length found himself saved
from the fate he had so greatly apprehended
at the moment of his
benefactor’s downfall. Of what
consequence was Wolsey to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_773" id="Page_773">[773]</a></span>
now? Banished from his archbishopric
of York, he was but a broken
footstool which Cromwell no
longer cared to remember. He
scarcely deigned to employ his new
friends in having Wolsey (reduced
to the condition of an invalid) removed
from the miserable abode
at Asher to the better situated castle
of Richmond; and later, when
the heads of the council, always apprehensive
and uneasy because of
his existence, obtained his peremptory
exile, he considered this departure
as completely liberating
him from every obligation to his old
benefactor.</p>

<p>Events were thus following each
other in rapid succession, when,
toward the middle of the day,
the door of the king’s cabinet
opened, and Sir Thomas More,
in the grand costume of lord
chancellor, entered as had been his
custom.</p>

<p>The king turned slightly around
on his chair, and fixed upon him a
searching glance, as if he sought to
read the inmost soul of More.</p>

<p>The countenance of the chancellor
was tranquil, respectful, and assured,
such as it had always been.
In vain Henry sought to discover
the indications of fear, the impetuous
desires and ambitions which he
was accustomed to excite or contradict
in the agitated heart of Wolsey,
and by which, in his turn master
of his favorite, of his future, and of
his great talents, he made him pay so
dearly for the honors at intervals
heaped upon him.</p>

<p>Nothing of all this could he discover!
More seated himself when
invited by the king, and entered
upon the discussion of a multitude
of affairs to which he had been devoting
himself with unremitting attention
day and night.</p>

<p>“Sire,” he would urge, “this
measure will be most useful to
your kingdom; sire, justice, it
seems to me, requires you to give
such a decision in that case.”</p>

<p>Never were any other considerations
brought to bear nor
other demands made; nothing for
himself, nothing for his family, but
all for the good of the state, the interests
of the people; silence upon
all subjects his conscience did not
oblige him to reveal, though the
king perceived only too clearly the
inmost depths of the pure and elevated
soul of his chancellor.</p>

<p>By dazzling this man of rare virtues
with a fortune to which a simple
gentleman could never aspire,
Henry had hoped to allure him to
his own party and induce him to
sustain the divorce bill. Thus, by
a monstrous contradiction, in corrupting
him by avarice and ambition,
he would have destroyed the
very virtues on which he wished to
lean. He perceived with indignation
that all his artifices had been
unsuccessful in influencing a will
accustomed to yield only to convictions
of duty, and he feared his
ability to move him by any of
the indirect and abstract arguments
which he felt and acknowledged to
himself were weak and insufficient.
Revolving all these reflections in
his mind, the king eagerly opened
the conversation with More, but in
a quiet tone and with an air of assumed
indifference.</p>

<p>“Well! Sir Thomas,” he said,
“have you reflected on what I asked
you? Do you not find now that
my marriage with my brother’s
wife was in opposition to all laws
human and divine, and that I
cannot do otherwise than have it
pronounced null and void, after being
thus advised by so many learned
men, and ecclesiastics also?”</p>

<p>“Sire,” replied More, “I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_774" id="Page_774">[774]</a></span>
done what your majesty requested
me; but it occurs to my mind that,
in an affair of so much importance,
it will not be sufficient to ask simply
the advice of those immediately
around you; for it might be feared
that, influenced by the affection
they bear for you, they would not
decide as impartially as your majesty
would desire. Perhaps, also,
some of them might be afraid of
offending you. I have, therefore,
concluded that it would be better
for your majesty to consult advisers
who are entirely removed from all
such suspicions. That is why I
have endeavored to collect together
in this manuscript I have here the
various passages of Holy Scripture
bearing on this subject. I have
added also the opinions of S. Augustine
and several other fathers
of the church, with whose eminent
learning and high authority among
the faithful your majesty is familiar.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the king, with a
slightly-marked movement of impatience,
“that was right. Leave it
there; I will read it.”</p>

<p>Sir Thomas deposited the manuscript
on the king’s table.</p>

<p>“My lord chancellor,” he continued,
“the House of Commons has
taken some steps toward discharging
my debts. What do they think
of this in the city?”</p>

<p>“Sire,” replied More, “I must
tell you candidly they complain
openly and loudly. They say if the
ministers had not taken care to introduce
into the house members
who had received their positions
from themselves, the bill would
never have passed; for it is altogether
unjust and iniquitous for
Parliament to dispose in this manner
of private property. They say
still farther that it has been inserted
in the preamble of the bill that
the prosperity of the kingdom under
the king’s paternal administration
had induced them to testify
their gratitude by discharging his
debts. If this pretext is sincere, it
reflects the greatest honor on Cardinal
Wolsey; and if, on the contrary,
it is false, it covers his successors
with shame.”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed the king,
“do they dare express themselves in
this manner?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Sir Thomas; “and
I will frankly say to the king that
it would have been far better to
have imposed a new tax supported
equally by all than thus to
despoil individuals of their patrimony.”</p>

<p>“They are never contented!” exclaimed
the king impatiently. “I
have sacrificed Wolsey to their hatred,
whom there is no person in
the kingdom now able to replace.
This Dr. Gardiner torments me
with questions which are far from
satisfactory to his dull comprehension.
Everything goes wrong, unless
I take the trouble of managing
it myself; while with the cardinal
the slightest suggestion was sufficient.
I constantly feel inclined to
recall him! Then we will see what
they will say! But no!” he continued,
with an expression of gloomy
sullenness, “they gave me no rest
until I had banished him from his
archbishopric of York. It was, they
said, the sole means of preventing
Parliament from pronouncing his
condemnation. By this time he is
doubtless already reconciled; he is
so vain a creature that the three
or four words I have said in his
favor to my nobles of the north
will have been worth more to him
than the homage and adulation of
a court, without which he cannot
exist. He is pious now, they say,
occupying himself only with good
works and in doing penance for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_775" id="Page_775">[775]</a></span>
his many sins of the past. In fact,
he is entirely reconciled! He has
already forgotten all that I have
done for him! I shall devote myself,
then, to those who now serve
me!”</p>

<p>“I doubt very much if your
majesty has been correctly informed
with regard to the latter fact,”
replied More. “Indeed, I know
that the order compelling him to
be entirely removed from your
majesty’s presence is the one that
caused him the deepest grief.”</p>

<p>“Ah! More,” interrupted the
king very suddenly, as if to take
him by surprise, “you are opposed
to my divorce. I have known it
perfectly well for a long time; and
these extracts from the fathers of
the church to which you refer me
are simply the expression of your
own opinions, which you wish to convey
to me in this indirect manner.”</p>

<p>“Sire,” replied More, slightly embarrassed,
“I had hoped your majesty
would not force me to give my
opinion on a subject of such grave
importance, and one, as I have already
explained, on which I possess
neither the authority nor the ability
to decide.”</p>

<p>“Ah! well, Sir Thomas,” replied
the king in a confident manner,
wishing to discover what effect his
words would produce on More,
“being entirely convinced of the
justice of my cause, and that nothing
can prevent me from availing
myself of it, I am determined, if
the pope refuses what I have a
right to demand, to withdraw from
the tyrannical yoke of his authority.
I will appoint a patriarch
in my kingdom, and the bishops
shall no longer submit to his jurisdiction.”</p>

<p>“A schism!” exclaimed More,
“a schism! Dismember the church
of Jesus Christ for a woman!”</p>

<p>And he paused, appalled at what
Henry had said and astonished at
his own energetic denunciation.</p>

<p>The king felt, as by a violent
shock, all the force of that exclamation,
and, dropping his head on
his breast, he remained stupefied,
like one who had just been aroused
from a painful and terrible dream.</p>

<p>Just at that moment the cabinet
door was thrown violently open,
and Lady Anne Boleyn entered precipitately.
She was drowned in
tears, and carried in her arms a
hunting spaniel that belonged to
the king.</p>

<p>She threw it into the centre of
the apartment, evidently in a frightful
rage.</p>

<p>“Here,” she cried, looking at the
king&mdash;“here is your wretched dog,
that has tried to strangle my favorite
bird! You never do anything
but try to annoy me, make me miserable,
and cause me all kinds of
intolerable vexations. I have told
you already that I did not want
that horrid animal in my chamber.”</p>

<p>In the meantime the dog, which
she had thrown on the floor, set up
a lamentable howl.</p>

<p>The king felt deeply humiliated
by this ridiculous scene, and especially
on account of the angry
familiarity exhibited by Anne Boleyn
in presence of Sir Thomas
More; for she either forgot herself
in her extreme excitement and indignation,
or she believed her empire
so securely established that
she did not hesitate to give these
proofs of it. She continued her
complaints and reproaches with increasing
haughtiness, until she was
interrupted by Dr. Stephen Gardiner,
who came to bring some newly-arrived
despatches to the king.</p>

<p>Henry arose immediately, and,
motioning Sir Thomas to open the
door, without saying a word, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_776" id="Page_776">[776]</a></span>
took Anne Boleyn by the hand, and,
leading her from the room, ordered
her to retire to her own apartment.</p>

<p>He then returned, and, seating
himself near the chancellor, concealed,
as far as he was able, his excitement
and mortification.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas, still more excited,
could not avoid, as they went over
the despatches, indignantly reflecting
on the manner in which Anne
Boleyn had treated the king, on
his deplorable infatuation, and the
terrible consequences to which that
infatuation must inevitably lead.</p>

<p>The king, divining the nature of
his reflections, experienced a degree
of humiliation that made him
inexpressibly miserable.</p>

<p>“What say these despatches?” he
asked, endeavoring to assume composure.
“What does More think of
me?” he said to himself&mdash;“he so
grave, so pious, so dignified! He
despises me!… That silly girl!”</p>

<p>“They give an account of the
emperor’s reception of the Earl of
Wiltshire,” answered More. “I
will read it aloud, if your majesty
wishes.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” said the king, whom
the name of Wiltshire confused
still more; “give them to me. I
am perfectly familiar with the cipher.”
He did not intend that
More should yet be apprised of
the base intrigues he had ordered
to be practised at Rome to assist
the father of his mistress in obtaining
the divorce.</p>

<p>Having taken the letters, he
found the emperor had treated his
ambassador with the utmost contempt,
remarking to Wiltshire that
he was an interested party, since he
was father of the queen’s rival, and
he would have to inform Henry
VIII. that the emperor was not a
merchant to sell the honor of his
aunt for three hundred thousand
crowns, even if he proposed to
abandon her cause, but, on the
contrary, he should defend it to
the last extremity; and after saying
this, the emperor had deliberately
turned his back on the ambassador
and forbidden him to be
again admitted to his presence.</p>

<p>Henry grew red and white alternately.</p>

<p>“I am, then, the laughing-stock
of Europe,” he murmured through
his firmly-set teeth.</p>

<p>Numerous other explanations followed,
in which the Earl of Wiltshire
gave an exact and circumstantial
account of the offer he had
made to the Holy Father of the
treatise composed by Cromwell on
the subject of the divorce, saying
that he had brought the author
with him, who was prepared to sustain
the opinions advanced against
all opposition. He ended by informing
the king that, in spite of
his utmost efforts, he had not been
able to prevent the pope from according
the emperor a brief forbidding
Henry to celebrate another
marriage before the queen’s case
had been entirely decided, and enjoining
him to treat her in the
meantime as his legitimate wife.</p>

<p>Wiltshire sent with his letter an
especial copy of that document,
adding that he feared the information
the Holy Father had received
of the violence exercised by the
English universities toward those
doctors who had voted against the
divorce, together with the money
and promises distributed among
those of France, especially the
University of Paris, to obtain favorable
decisions, had not contributed
toward influencing him.</p>

<p>The king read and re-read several
times all these statements, and
was entirely overwhelmed with indignation
and disappointment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_777" id="Page_777">[777]</a></span></p>

<p>“And why,” he angrily exclaimed,
dashing the earl’s letter as far
as possible from him&mdash;“why have
these flatterers surrounding me always
assured me I would succeed
in my undertaking? Why could
they not foresee that it would be impossible?
and why have I not found
a sincere friend who might have admonished
me? More!” he cried
after a moment’s silence&mdash;“More, I
am most miserable! What could be
more unjust? I am devoted to Lady
Anne Boleyn as my future wife;
and now they wish to make me renounce
her. The emperor’s intrigues
prevail, and against all laws,
human and divine, they condemn
me to eternal celibacy!”</p>

<p>“Ah!” replied Sir Thomas in a
firm but sadly respectful manner,
“yes, it is indeed distressing to see
your majesty thus voluntarily destroy
your own peace, that of your
kingdom, the happiness of your
subjects, the regard for your own
honor, so many benefits, in fact,
and all for the foolish love of a girl
who possesses neither worth nor
reputation.”</p>

<p>“More,” exclaimed the king,
“do not speak of her in this manner!
She is young and thoughtless,
but in her heart she is devoted to
me.”</p>

<p>“That is,” replied More, “she
is entirely devoted to the crown;
she loves dearly the honors of royalty,
and her pride is doubly flattered.”</p>

<p>“More,” said the king, “I forgive
you for speaking thus to me;
your severe morals, your austere
virtues, have not permitted you to
experience the torments of love,
and that is why,” he added gloomily,
“you cannot comprehend its irresistible
impulses and true sentiments.”</p>

<p>“Nothing that is known to one
man is unknown to another,” replied
More. “Love, in itself, is a
sublime sentiment that comes from
God; but, alas! men drag it in the
dust, like all else they touch, and too
often mistake the appearance for the
reality. To love anyone, O my king!”
continued More, “is it not to prefer
them in all things above yourself,
to consider yourself as nothing,
and be willing to sacrifice
without regret all that you would
wish to possess?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Henry VIII.; “and
that is the way I love Anne&mdash;more
than my life, more than the entire
world!”</p>

<p>“No, no, sire!” exclaimed More,
“don’t tell me that. No, don’t say
you love her; say you love the pleasure
she affords you, the attractions
she possesses, which have charmed
your senses&mdash;in a word, acknowledge
that you love yourself in her,
and consider well that the day
when nature deprives her of her
gifts and graces your memory will
no longer represent her to you but
as an insipid image, worthy only of
a scornful oblivion! Ah! if you
loved her truly, you would act in
a different manner. You would
never have considered aught but
her happiness and her interests;
you would blush for her, and you
would not be able to endure the
thought of the shame with which
you have not hesitated to cover
her yourself in the eyes of all your
court!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” … replied Henry
in a low and altered voice. “But
she&mdash;she loves me; I cannot doubt
that.”</p>

<p>“She loves the King of England!”
replied More excitedly,
“but not Henry; she loves the
mighty prince who ignominiously
bends his neck beneath the yoke
which she pleases to impose on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_778" id="Page_778">[778]</a></span>
him. But poor and destitute, her
glance would never have fallen
upon you. Proud of her beauty,
vain of her charms, she holds you
like a conquered vassal whom she
governs by a gesture or a word.
She loves riches, honors and the
pleasures with which you surround
her. She is dazzled by the <i lang="fr">éclat</i> of
the high rank you occupy, and, to
attain it, she fears not to purchase
it at the price of your soul and all
that you possess. What matters
to her the care of your honor or
the love of your subjects? Has
she ever said to you: ‘Henry, I
love you, but your duty separates
you from me; be great, be virtuous’?
Has she said: ‘Catherine,
your wife, is my sovereign, and I
recognize no other’? Do you not
hear the voice of your people saying
to your children: ‘You shall reign
over us’? But what am I saying?
No, of course she has not spoken
thus; because she seeks to elevate
herself, she thinks of her own aggrandizement&mdash;to
see at her feet
men whom she would never otherwise
be able to command.”</p>

<p>“What shall I do, then, what
shall I do?” cried Henry dolorously.</p>

<p>“Marry Anne Boleyn,” replied
Thomas More coolly; “you should
do it, since you have broken off her
marriage with the Earl of Northumberland.
If not, send her away
from court.”</p>

<p>“I will do it! … No, I will
not do it!” he exclaimed, almost in
the same breath. “I shall never
be able to do it.”</p>

<p>“That is to say, you never intend
to do it,” replied More. “We can
always accomplish what we resolve.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” replied Henry; “we
cannot always do what we wish.
Everything conspires against me.
Tired of willing, I can make nothing
bend to my will! Of what
use is my royal power? To be
happy is a thing impossible!”</p>

<p>“Yes, of all things in this life
most impossible,” answered More;
“and he who aspires to attain it
finds his miseries redoubled at the
very moment he thinks they will
terminate. The possession of unlawful
pleasures is poisoned by the
remorse that follows in their train;
and, frightened by their insecurity
and short duration, we are prevented
from enjoying them in quietness
and peace.”</p>

<p>“Then,” cried Henry VIII.,
stamping his foot violently on the
floor, “we had better be dead.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Thomas More,
“and to-morrow perhaps we may
be!”</p>

<p>“To-morrow!” repeated the king,
as if struck with terror. “No, no,
More, not to-morrow. … I would
not be willing now to appear in the
presence of God.”</p>

<p>“Then,” replied More, “how can
you expect to live peaceably in a
condition in which you are afraid
to die? In a few hours, or at least
in a few years (that is as certain
as the light of day which shines
this moment), your life and mine
will have to end, leaving nothing
more than regrets for the past and
fears for the future.”</p>

<p>“You say truly, More,” replied
the king; “but life appears so long
to us, the future so far removed!
Is it necessary, then, that we be always
thinking of it and sacrificing
our pleasures?… Later&mdash;well,
we will change. Will we not have
more time then to think of it?”</p>

<p>“Ah!” replied More sadly, “there
remains very little time to him
who is always putting off until to-morrow.”</p>

<p>As he heard the last words, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_779" id="Page_779">[779]</a></span>
king’s face grew instantly crimson.
He kept More with him, entertaining
him with his trials and vexations,
and the night was far advanced
before he permitted him to
retire.</p>

<p class="break">During four entire days the king
remained shut up in his apartment,
and Anne Boleyn vainly attempted
to gain admittance.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a rumor of her downfall
spread rapidly through the
palace. The courtiers who were
accustomed to attend her <i lang="fr">levées</i> in
greater numbers and much more
scrupulously than those of Queen
Catherine, suddenly discontinued,
and on the last occasion scarcely
one of them made his appearance.
They also took great care to preserve
a frigid reserve and doubtful
politeness, which excited to the
last degree her alarm and that of
her ambitious family.</p>

<p>The latter were every moment
in dread of the blow that seemed
ready to fall upon them. In this
state of gloomy disquiet every
circumstance was anxiously noted
and served to excite their apprehensions.
They continually discussed
among themselves the arrival
of the despatches from Rome,
the nature of which they suspected
from the very long time Sir Thomas
More had remained with the king.
Then they refreshed their memories
with reflections on the inflexible
severity of the lord chancellor,
his old attachment for Queen Catherine&mdash;an
attachment which the
elevation of More had never interrupted,
as they had hoped would be
the case. Finally, the sincerity of
his nature and the estimation in
which he was held by the king
made them, with great reason, apprehend
the influence of his counsel.
Already they found themselves
abandoned by almost all of
those upon whose support they
had relied. Suffolk, leagued with
them heretofore, in order to secure
the downfall of Cardinal Wolsey,
now regarded them in their disgrace
as of little consequence to
one so closely related as himself
to his majesty by the princess, his
wife. The Duke of Norfolk, justly
proud of his birth, his wealth, and
his reputation, could not believe
the power with which the influence
of his niece had clothed him in the
council by any means bound him
to engage in or compromise himself
in her cause. In the meantime
they realized that they would
inevitably be compelled to succumb
or make a last and desperate
effort, and they resolved with one
accord to address themselves to
Cromwell, whose shrewdness and
cunning, joined to the motives of
self-interest that could be brought
to bear on him, seemed to offer them
a last resort.</p>

<p>Cromwell immediately understood
all the benefit he would be
likely to derive from the situation
whether he succeeded or failed in
the cause of Anne Boleyn, and
determined, according to his own
expression, to “make or unmake.”
He wrote to the king, demanding
an audience. “He fully realized,”
he wrote, with his characteristic
adroitness, “his entire incapacity
for giving advice, but neither his
devoted affection nor his sense of
duty would permit him to remain
silent when he knew the anxiety
his sovereign was suffering. It
might be deemed presumptuous in
him to say it, but he believed all
the difficulties embarrassing the
king arose from the timidity of his
advisers, who were misled by exterior
appearances or deceived by
the opinions of the vulgar.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_780" id="Page_780">[780]</a></span></p>

<p>The king immediately granted
him an audience, although his usual
custom was to remain entirely secluded
and alone while laboring
under these violent transports of
passion. He hoped that Cromwell
might be able to present his opinions
with such ability as would at
least be sufficient to divert him
from the wretchedness he experienced.</p>

<p>Cromwell appeared before him
with eyes cast down and affecting
an air of sadness and constraint.</p>

<p>“Sire,” he said, as he approached
the king, “yesterday, even yesterday,
I was happy&mdash;yes, happy in
the thought of being permitted to
present myself before your majesty;
because it seemed to me I might
be able to offer some consolation
for the anxieties you experience
by reminding you that nothing
should induce you to pause in your
efforts to advance the interests of
the kingdom and the state. But
to-day, in appearing before you, I
know not what to say. This morning
Lady Boleyn, being informed
that I was to have the happiness
of seeing your majesty, sent for me
and charged me with the commission
of asking your majesty’s permission
for her to withdraw from
court.”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed Henry, rising
hastily to his feet, “she wishes
to leave me?&mdash;she, my only happiness,
my only joy? Never!”</p>

<p>“I have found her,” continued
Cromwell, seeming not to remark
the painful uneasiness he had aroused
in the king’s mind&mdash;“I have
found her plunged in a state of
indescribable grief. She was almost
deprived of consciousness; her
beautiful eyes were weighed down
with tears, her long hair hanging
neglected around her shoulders;
and her pale, transparent cheek
made her resemble a delicate white
rose bowed on its slender stem before
the violence of the tempest.
‘Go, my dear Cromwell,’ she said
to me with a tremulous voice, but
sweet as the soft expiring notes
of an æolian lyre&mdash;‘go, say to my
king, to my lord, I ask his permission
to retire this day to my father’s
country-seat. I know that I am
surrounded by enemies, but, while
favored by his protection, I have
not feared their malice. But now
I feel, and cannot doubt it, I shall
become their victim, since they
have succeeded in prejudicing my
sovereign against me to such an
extent that he refuses to hear my
defence.’”</p>

<p>“What can she be afraid of
here?” cried the king. “Who
would dare offend her in my
palace?”</p>

<p>“Who will be able to defend her
if your majesty abandons her?” replied
Cromwell in a haughty tone,
feigning to forget the humble demeanor
he had assumed, and mentally
applauding the success of his
stratagem. “Has she not given
up all for you? Every day she
has wounded by her refusals the
greatest lords of the realm, who
have earnestly sued for her heart
and hand; but she has constantly
refused to listen to them because
of the love she bears for you&mdash;always
preferring the uncertain hope
of one day becoming yours to all
the brilliant advantages of the
wealthiest suitors she has been
urged to accept. But to-day, when
her honor is attacked, when you
banish her from your presence, she
feels she will not have the courage
to endure near you such wretchedness,
and she asks to be permitted
to withdraw from court at once
and for ever!”</p>

<p>“For ever?” repeated the king.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_781" id="Page_781">[781]</a></span>
“Cromwell, has she said that?
Have you heard her right? No,
Cromwell, you are mistaken! I
know her better than you.” And
he turned on Cromwell a keen,
scrutinizing glance.</p>

<p>But nothing could daunt this
audacious man.</p>

<p>“She said all I have told you,”
replied the hypocrite, with the coolest
assurance, raising his head
haughtily. “Would I dare to repeat
what I have not heard? And your
majesty can imagine that my devotion
has alone induced me to
become the bearer of so painful a
message; for I could not believe,
your majesty had ceased to love
her.”</p>

<p>“Never!” cried the king.
“Never have I for one moment
ceased to adore her! But listen,
dear Cromwell, and be convinced
of how wretched I am! Yesterday
I received from Rome the most distressing
intelligence. I had written
the pope a letter, signed by a
great number of lords of my court
and bishops of the kingdom, in
which they expressed the fears
they entertained of one day seeing
the flames of civil war break out
in this country if I should die without
male heirs, as there would be
grounds for contesting the right of
my daughter Mary to the throne
on the score of her legitimacy. But
nothing can move him.”</p>

<p class="break">Here the king rose, furiously indignant.
“He has answered this
petition,” he cried, walking with
hurried strides up and down the
floor; “and how?… By my faith,
I can scarcely repeat it.… That
he pardons the terms they have
used in their letter, attributing
them to the affection they bear for
me; that he is under still greater
obligations to me than they have
mentioned; that it is not his fault
if the affair of the divorce remains
undecided; that he has sent legates
to England; that the queen has refused
to recognize them, and appealed
from all they have done; that
he has tried vainly in every possible
way to terminate the affair amicably;
and, furthermore, ‘You will,
perhaps, be ready to say,’ he writes,
‘that, being under so many obligations
to the king as I am, I should
waive all other considerations and
accord him absolutely everything
he asks.’ Although that would be
sovereignly unjust, yet he can conclude
nothing else from their letter;
that they reflect not on the queen
having represented to him, that all
Christendom is scandalized because
they would attempt to annul a marriage
contracted so many years ago,
at the request of two great kings
and under a dispensation from the
pope&mdash;a marriage confirmed by the
birth of several children! And
what else? Let me see:… That
if I rely on the opinion of several
doctors and universities, he refers,
on his part, to the law of God upon
the sanctity and unity of marriage,
and the highest authorities taken
from the Hebrew and Latin writers;
that the decisions of the universities
which I bring forward are supported
by no proofs; he cannot decide
finally upon that, and, if he
should precipitate his judgment,
they would no longer be able to
avert the evils with which it is
said England is threatened; that
he desires as much as they that I
may have male heirs, but he is not
God to give them to me; he has
no greater wish than to please me
as far as lies in his power, without
at the same time violating all the
laws of justice and equity; and,
finally, he conjures them to cease
demanding of him things that are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_782" id="Page_782">[782]</a></span>
opposed to his conscience, in order
that he may be spared the pain of
refusing! Mark that well, Cromwell&mdash;the
pain of refusing! Thus,
you see, after having tried everything,
spent everything, and used
every possible means, what remains
now for me to hope?”</p>

<p>“All that you wish,” replied
Cromwell; “everything without
exception! Why permit yourself
to be governed by those who ought
to be your slaves? Among all the
clergy who surround you, and whom
you are able to reduce, if you
choose, to mendicity, can you not
find a priest who will marry you?
If I were King of England, I would
very soon convince them that the
happiness of <em>their</em> lives depended
entirely upon <em>mine</em>! Threaten to
withdraw from the authority of
Rome, and you will very soon see
them yielding, on their knees, to all
your demands.”</p>

<p>“Cromwell,” said Henry VIII.,
“I admire your spirit and the boldness
of the measures you advocate.
From this moment I open to you
the door of my council. Remember
the kindness and the signal
favor with which I have honored
you. However, your inexperienced
zeal carries you too far; you forget
that the day I would determine
really to separate myself from the
Church of Rome, I would become
schismatic, and the people would
refuse to obey me. Moreover I
am a Catholic, and I wish to die
one.”</p>

<p>“What of that?” replied Cromwell.
“Am I not also a Catholic?
Because your majesty frightens the
pope, will he cease to exist? Declare
to him that from this day you
no longer recognize his authority;
that you forbid the clergy paying
their tithes to, or receiving from
him their nominations. You will
see, then, if the next day your present
marriage is not annulled and
the one you wish to contract approved
and ratified.”</p>

<p>“Do you really believe it?” said
the king.</p>

<p>“I am sure of it,” replied Cromwell.</p>

<p>“No,” said the king. “It is a
thing utterly impossible; the bishops
would refuse to accede to any
such requirements, and they would
be right. They know too well that
it is essential for the church to
have a head in order to maintain
her unity, and without it nothing
would follow but confusion and disorder.”</p>

<p>“Well! who can prevent your
majesty from becoming yourself
that head?” exclaimed Cromwell.
“Is England not actually a monster
now with two heads, one of them
wanting a thing, and the other not?
Follow the example given you by
those German princes who are freeing
themselves from the yoke which
has humbled them for so many
years before the throne of a pontiff
who is a stranger alike to their affections
and their interests! Then
everything anomalous will rectify
itself, and your subjects cease to
believe that any other than yourself
is entitled to their homage or
submission.”</p>

<p>“You are right, little Cromwell!”
cried Henry VIII., this
seductive and perfidious discourse
flattering at the same time his
guilty passion and the ambition
that divided his soul. “But how
would you proceed about executing
this marvellous project, of which a
thought had already crossed my
own mind?&mdash;for, as I have just told
you, the clergy will refuse to obey
me, and I shall then have no means
of compelling them.”</p>

<p>“Your consideration and kindness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_783" id="Page_783">[783]</a></span>
make you forget,” replied
Cromwell adroitly, afraid of wounding
the king’s pride, “the statutes
of præmunire offer you means both
sure and easy. Is it not by those
laws they have tried Wolsey before
the Parliament? In condemning
him they have condemned themselves,
and have made themselves
amenable to the same penalties.
You have them all in your power.
Threaten to punish them in their
turn, if they refuse to take the oath
acknowledging you as head of the
church; and do it fearlessly if they
dare attempt to resist you.”</p>

<p>“Well, little Cromwell,” said
Henry VIII., slapping him familiarly
on the shoulder, “I observe
with great satisfaction your coolness
and the variety of resources
you have at command. You see
everything at a glance and fear nothing.
I have made all these objections
only to hear how you
would meet them. Here, take
these Roman documents, read them
for yourself, and you will be better
able to appreciate their contents;
while I go and beg Anne to forget
the wrongs I so cruelly reproach
myself with having inflicted on her.”</p>

<p>Saying this, Henry VIII. went
out, and Cromwell followed him
with his eyes as he walked through
the long gallery.</p>

<p>An ironical smile hovered over
his thin and bloodless lips as he
watched him. “Go, go,” he murmured
to himself, “throw yourself
at the feet of your silly mistress, and
ask her pardon for wishing her to
be queen of England. They are
grand, very grand, these kings, and
yet they find themselves very often
held in the hollow of the hand of
some low and crafty flatterer!
‘Despicable creature!’ they will
say. Yes, I am despicable in the
eyes of many; and yet they prepare,
by my advice, to overthrow
the pillars of the church, in order
to enrich me with its consecrated
spoils.”</p>

<p>He laughed a diabolical laugh;
then suddenly his face grew dark,
and a fierce, malignant gleam shot
from his eyes. “Go,” he continued&mdash;“go,
prince as false as you are
wicked. I, at least, am your equal
in cunning and duplicity. You
were not created for good, and the
odious voice of More will call you
in vain to the path of virtue. My
tongue&mdash;ay, mine&mdash;is to you far
sweeter! It carries a poison that
you will suck with eager lips. The
son of the poor fuller will make
you his partner in crime. He will
recline with you on your velvet
throne, and perfidious cruelty will
unite us heart and soul!… Go,
seek that fool whom you adore and
who will weary you very soon, and
the vile, ambitious father who has
begotten her. But, for me! …
destroy your kingdom, profane the
sanctuary, light the funeral pyre,
and compel all those to mount it
who shall oppose the laws Cromwell
will dictate to you! Two ferocious
beasts to-day share the throne of
England! You will surfeit me with
gold, and I will make you drunk
with blood! You shall proclaim
aloud what I shall have whispered
in your ear! Ha! who of the two
will be really king&mdash;Henry VIII.
or Cromwell? Why, Cromwell,
without doubt; because he was
born in the mire. He has learned
how to fly while the other was being
fledged beneath the shadow of
the crown! You have been reared
within these walls of gold,” continued
Cromwell, surveying the magnificent
adornings of the royal
chamber; “these exquisite perfumes,
escaping from fountains and
flowers, have always surround you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_784" id="Page_784">[784]</a></span>
You have never known, like me,
abandonment and want, suffered
from cold and hunger in a thatched
cottage, and imbibed the hatred,
fostered in those abodes of wretchedness,
against the rich; but I have
cherished that rage in my inmost
soul! There it burns like a consuming
fire! I will have a palace.
I will have power and be feared.
Servile courtiers shall fawn at my
feet, adulation shall surround me.
I would grasp the entire world, and
yet the cry of my soul would be,
More, still more!”</p>

<p>Saying this, Cromwell threw himself
into the king’s arm-chair, and,
pushing contemptuously from him
the papers he had taken to read,
abandoned himself entirely to the
furious thirst of avarice and ambition
that devoured him.</p>

<p class="break">The curfew had already sounded
many hours, and profound silence
reigned over the city. Not a
sound was heard throughout the
dark and winding streets, save the
boisterous shouts of some midnight
revellers returning from a party of
pleasure, or the dreary and monotonous
song of a besotted inebriate
as he staggered toward his home.</p>

<p>In the mansion of the French
ambassador, however, no one had
retired; and young De Vaux, impatiently
waiting the return of M.
du Bellay, paced with measured
tread up and down the large hall
where for many hours supper had
been served.</p>

<p>Weary with listening for the
sound of footsteps, and hearing
only the mournful sighing of the
night-wind, he at length seated himself
before the fire in a great tapestried
arm-chair whose back, rising
high above his head, turned over
in the form of a canopy, and gave
him the appearance of a saint reposing
in the depths of his shrine.
For a long time he watched the
sparks as they flew upward from
the fire, then, taking a book from
his pocket, he opened it at random;
but before reaching the bottom of
the first page his eyes closed, the
book fell from his hands, and he
sank into a profound sleep, from
which he was aroused only by the
noise made by the ambassador’s
servants on the arrival of their
master.</p>

<p>M. de Vaux, being suddenly
aroused from sleep, arose hastily to
his feet on seeing the ambassador
enter.</p>

<p>“I have waited for you with the
greatest impatience,” he exclaimed
with a suppressed yawn.</p>

<p>“Say, rather, you have been
sleeping soundly in your chair,”
replied M. du Bellay, smiling.
“Here!” he continued, turning
toward the valets who followed
him, “take my cloak and hat, and
then leave us; you can remove the
table in the morning.”</p>

<p>Obedient to their master’s orders,
they lighted several more lamps
and retired, not without regret,
however, at losing the opportunity
of catching, during the repast,
a word that might have satisfied
their curiosity as to the cause
of M. du Bellay having remained
at the king’s palace until so late an
hour.</p>

<p>“Well, monsieur! what has
been done at last?” eagerly inquired
young De Vaux as soon as
they had left.</p>

<p>“In truth, I cannot yet comprehend
it myself,” replied Du Bellay.
“In spite of all my efforts, it has
been impossible to clearly unravel
the knot of intrigue. This morning,
as you know, nothing was talked
of but the downfall of Anne
Boleyn. I was delighted; her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_785" id="Page_785">[785]</a></span>
overthrow would have dispensed
us from all obligations. Now the
king is a greater fool about her
than ever, and, unless God himself
strikes a blow to sever them, I believe
nothing will cure him of his
infatuation. As I entered, his first
word was to demand why I had
been so long in presenting myself.
‘Sire,’ I replied, ‘I have come with
the utmost haste, I assure you, and
am here ready to execute any orders
it may please you to give!’”</p>

<p>“‘Listen,’ he then said to me. ‘I
have several things to tell you;
but the first of all is to warn you
of my determination to arrest Cardinal
Wolsey. I am aware that
you have manifested a great deal
of interest in him; … that you
have even gone to see him when
he was sick; … but that is of no
consequence. I am far from believing
that you are in any manner
concerned in the treason he has
meditated against me. Therefore
I have wished to advise you, that
you may feel no apprehension on
that account.’ I was struck with
astonishment. ‘What! sire,’ I at
last answered, ‘the cardinal betray
you? Why, he is virtually banished
from England, where he occupies
himself, they say, only in doing
works of charity and mercy.’ ‘I
know what I say to you,’ replied
the king; ‘his own servants accuse
him of conspiring against the state.
But I shall myself examine into
the depths of this accusation. In
the meantime he shall be removed
to the Tower, and I will send Sir
Walsh with instructions to join the
Earl of Northumberland, in order
to arrest Wolsey at Cawood Castle,
where he is now established.’”</p>

<p>“Is it possible?” cried De Vaux,
interrupting M. du Bellay. “That
unfortunate cardinal! Who could
have brought down this new storm
on his head? M. du Bellay, do
you believe him capable of committing
this crime, even if it were
in his power?”</p>

<p>“I do not believe a word of it,”
replied M. du Bellay, “and I know
not who has excited this new storm
of persecution. I have tried every
possible means to ascertain from
the king, but he constantly evaded
my questions by answering in a
vague and obscure manner. I
have been informed in the palace
that he had seen no person during
the day, except Cromwell, Lady
Boleyn, and the Duke of Suffolk.
Might this not be the result of a
plot concocted between them?
This is only a conjecture, and we
may never get at the bottom of the
affair. But let us pass on to matters
of more importance. The
mistress is in high favor again.
The king is determined to marry
her, and has proclaimed in a threatening
manner that he will separate
himself from the communion of
Rome, and no more permit the supremacy
of the Sovereign Pontiff
to be recognized in his kingdom.
He demands that the King of
France shall do the same, and
rely on his authority in following
his example.”</p>

<p>“What!” cried De Vaux, astounded
by this intelligence. “And
how have you answered him, my
lord?”</p>

<p>“I said all that I felt authorized
or could say,” replied Du Bellay;
“but what means shall we use
to persuade a man so far transported
and subjugated by his passions
that he seems to be a fool&mdash;no
longer capable of reasoning, of comprehending
either his duty, the
laws, or the future? I have held
up to him the disruption of his
kingdom, the horrors that give
birth to a war of religion, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_786" id="Page_786">[786]</a></span>
blood that it would cause him to
spill.”</p>

<p>“‘I shall spill as much of it as
may be necessary,’ he replied, ‘to
make them yield. They will have
their choice. Already the representatives
of the clergy have been
ordered to assemble. Well! they
shall decide among themselves
which is preferable&mdash;death, exile,
or obedience to my will.’</p>

<p>“Whilst saying this,” continued
M. du Bellay, with a gloomy expression,…
“he played with
a bunch of roses, carelessly plucking
off the leaves with his fingers.”</p>

<p>“But what has been able to
bring the king, in so short a time,
to such an extremity?” asked De
Vaux, whose eyes, full of astonishment
and anxiety, interrogated
those of M. du Bellay.</p>

<p>“His base passions, without
doubt; and, still more, the vile flattery
coming from some one of those
he has taken into favor,” replied
Du Bellay impatiently.…
“I tried in vain to discover who
the arch-hypocrite could be, but the
king was never for a moment thrown
off his guard; he constantly repeated:
‘<em>I</em> have resolved on this; <em>I</em>
will do that!’ … I shall find
out, however, hereafter,” continued
Du Bellay; “but at present I am
in ignorance.”</p>

<p>“Has he said anything to you
about the grand master?” asked
De Vaux.</p>

<p>“No; but it seems he has been
very much exercised on account
of the cordial reception Chancellor
Duprat gave Campeggio when he
passed through France. ‘That
man has behaved very badly toward
me,’ he said sharply. ‘I was so
lenient as to let him leave my kingdom
unmolested, after having hesitated
a long time whether I should
not punish him severely for his conduct;
and, behold, one of your
ministers receives and treats him
with the utmost magnificence!’</p>

<p>“I assured him no consequence
should be attached to that circumstance,
and pretended that Chancellor
Duprat was so fond of good
cheer and grand display he had
doubtless been too happy to have
an opportunity of parading his
wealth and luxury before the eyes
of a stranger.</p>

<p>“He then renewed the attack
against Wolsey. ‘If that be the
case,’ he exclaimed, ‘this must be
a malady common to all these chancellors;
for my lord cardinal was
also preparing to give a royal reception
in the capital of his realm of
York; but, unfortunately,’ he added
with an ironical sneer, ‘I happen
to be his master, and we have somewhat
interfered with his plans.’ He
then attacked the pope, then our
king; and finally, while the hour
of midnight was striking, exhausted
with anger and excitement, to my
great relief, he permitted me to retire.
Now,” added M. du Bellay,
“we will have to spend the rest of
the night in writing, and to-morrow
the courier must be despatched.”</p>

<h3>PRUSSIA AND THE CHURCH.</h3>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p>In February, 1848, Louis Philippe
was driven from his throne by
the people of Paris, and the Republic
was proclaimed. This revolution
rapidly spread over the whole
of Europe. The shock was most
violent in Germany, where everything
was in readiness for a general
outburst. Most of the governments
were compelled to yield to the
popular will and to make important
concessions. New cabinets
were formed in Würtemberg, Darmstadt,
Nassau, and Hesse. Lewis
of Bavaria was forced to abdicate.
Hanover and Saxony held out until
Berlin and Vienna were invaded by
the revolutionary party, when they
too succumbed. On the 13th of
March the Vienna mob overthrew
the Austrian ministry, and Metternich
fled to England. Italy
and Hungary revolted. Berlin was
held all summer by an ignorant
revolutionary faction. In September
fierce and bloody riots
broke out in Frankfort.</p>

<p>Popular meetings, secret societies,
revolutionary clubs, violent
declamations, and inflammatory appeals
through the press kept all
Germany in a state of agitation.
Occasional outbreaks among the
peasantry, followed by pillage and
incendiarism, increased the general
confusion.</p>

<p>It was during this time of wild
excitement that the elections for
the Imperial Parliament were held.
To this assembly many avowed
atheists, pantheists, communists,
and Jacobins were chosen&mdash;men
who fully agreed with Hecker
when he declared that “there
were six plagues in Germany&mdash;the
princes, the nobles, the bureaucrats,
the capitalists, the parsons,
and the soldiers.” The parties in the
Parliament took their names from
their positions in the assembly hall,
and were called the extreme left,
the left, the left centre, the right
centre, the right, and the extreme
right. The first three were composed
of red republicans, Jacobins,
and liberals. To the right centre
belonged the constitutional liberals;
and on the right and right
centre sat the Catholic members,
the predecessors of the party of the
<i lang="de">Centrum</i> of the present day. The
extreme right was occupied by
functionaries and bureaucrats,
chiefly from Prussia. The Parliament
of Frankfort, in the <i lang="de">Grundrechte</i>,
or <cite>Fundamental Rights</cite>,
which it proclaimed, decreed universal,
suffrage, abolished all the political
rights of the aristocracy, the
hereditary chambers in all the
states of Germany, set aside the
existing family entails, and, though
nominally it retained the imperial
power, degraded the emperor to a
republican president by giving him
merely a suspensive veto.</p>

<p>While this Parliament was sitting
the Catholic bishops of Germany
assembled in council at Würzburg,
and, at the conclusion of their deliberations,
drew up a Memorial as
firm in tone as it was clear and precise
in expression, in which they
set forth the claims of the church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_788" id="Page_788">[788]</a></span></p>

<p>“To bring about,” they said, “a
separation from the state&mdash;that is
to say, from public order, which
necessarily reposes on a moral
and religious foundation&mdash;is not according
to the will of the church.
If the state will perforce separate
from the church, so will the
church, without approving, tolerate
what it cannot avoid; and when
not compelled by the duty of self-preservation,
she will not break the
bonds of union made fast by mutual
understanding.</p>

<p>“The church, entrusted with the
solemn and holy mission, ‘As my
Father hath sent me, so send I ye,’
requires for the accomplishment of
this mission, whatever the form of
government of the state may be,
the fullest freedom and independence.
Her holy popes, prelates,
and confessors have in all ages willingly
and courageously given up
their life and blood for the preservation
of this inalienable freedom.”</p>

<p>In virtue of these principles the
bishops, in this Memorial, claimed
the right of directing, without any
interference on the part of the state,
theological seminaries, and of founding
schools, colleges, and all kinds
of educational establishments; of
exerting canonical control, unfettered
by state meddling, over the
conduct of their clergy, as well as
that of introducing into their dioceses
religious orders, congregations,
and pious confraternities, for which
they demanded the same rights
which the new political constitution
had granted to secular associations.
Finally, they asserted their right to
free and untrammelled communication
with the Holy See; and, as included
in this, that of receiving and
publishing all papal bulls, briefs,
and other documents without the
Royal Placet, which they declared
to be repugnant to the honor
and dignity of the ministers of religion.</p>

<p>The Frankfort Parliament decreed
the total separation of church
and state, and was therefore compelled
to guarantee the freedom of
all religions. This separation was
sanctioned by the Catholic members
of the Assembly, who looked
upon it as less dangerous to the
cause of religion and morality than
ecclesiastical Josephism. In the
present conflict between the church
and the German Empire the Catholic
party has again demanded,
and in vain, the separation of
church and state. In rejecting
their urgent request, Dr. Falk declared
that the leading minds in
England and America are already
beginning to regret that their governments
have so little control
over the ecclesiastical organizations
within their limits.</p>

<p>Whilst the representatives of the
German people at Frankfort were
abolishing the privileges of the nobles,
decreeing the separation of
church and state, and forgetting
the standing armies, the governments
were quietly gathering their
forces. Marshal Radetzky put
down the Italian rebellion, Prince
Windischgrätz quelled the democracy
of Vienna, and General Wrangel
took possession of Berlin, without
a battle. Russia, at the request
of Austria, sent an army into Hungary
to destroy the rebellion in
that country, and the disturbances
in Bavaria and in the Palatinate
were suppressed by Prussian troops
under the present Emperor of Germany.
The representatives of the
larger states withdrew from the
Frankfort Parliament, which dwindled,
and finally, amidst universal
contempt and neglect, came to an
end at Stuttgart, June 18, 1849.</p>

<p>But the liberties of the church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_789" id="Page_789">[789]</a></span>
were not lost. In Prussia, as we
have seen, a better state of things
had begun with the imprisonment
of the heroic Archbishop of Cologne
in 1837. In the face of the menacing
attitude of the German democrats
and republicans, Frederick
William IV. confirmed the liberties
of the Catholic Church by the letters-patent
of 1847.</p>

<p>The constitutions of December
5, 1848, and January 31, 1850, were
drawn up in the lurid light of
the revolution, which had beaten
fiercest upon the house of Hohenzollern.
The king had capitulated
to the insurgents, withdrawn his
soldiers from the capital, and abandoned
Berlin, and with it the whole
state, for nine months to the tender
mercies of the mob. He was
forced to witness the most revolting
spectacles. The dead bodies
of the rioters were borne in procession
under the windows of his
palace, while the rabble shouted
to him: “Fritz, off with your
hat.”</p>

<p>It is not surprising, in view of
this experience, that we should find
in the constitution of 1850 (articles
15 to 18 inclusive) a very satisfactory
recognition of the rights of
the church. Why these paragraphs
granting the church freedom to
regulate and administer its own
affairs; to keep possession of its
own revenues, endowments, and establishments,
whether devoted to
worship, education, or beneficence;
and freely to communicate with the
Pope, were inserted in the constitution,
we know from Prince Bismarck
himself. In his speech in
the Prussian Upper House, March
10, 1873, he affirmed that “they
were introduced at a time when the
state needed, or thought it needed,
help, and believed that it would
find this help by leaning on the
Catholic Church. It was probably
led to this belief by the fact
that in the National Assembly of
1848 all the electoral districts with
a preponderant Catholic population
returned&mdash;I will not say royalist
representatives, but certainly
men who were the friends of order,
which was not the case in the Protestant
districts.”</p>

<p>The provisions of the constitution
of 1850 with regard to the
church were honorably and faithfully
carried out down to the beginning
of the present conflict.
Never since the Reformation had
the church in Prussia been so free,
never had she made such rapid progress,
whether in completing her
internal organization or in extending
her influence. The Prussian
liberals and atheists, who had
fully persuaded themselves that
without the wealth and aid of the
state the Catholic religion would
have no force, were amazed. The
influence of the priests over the
people grew in proportion as they
were educated more thoroughly in
the spirit and discipline of the
church under the immediate supervision
of the bishops, unfettered
by state interference; the number
of convents, both of men and women,
rapidly increased; associations
of all kinds, scientific, benevolent,
and religious, spread over the
land; religious journals and reviews
were founded in which Catholic
interests were ably advocated
and defended; and all the
forces of the church were unified
and guided by the harmonious action
of a most enlightened and
zealous episcopate.</p>

<p>This was the more astonishing
as the Evangelical Church, whose
liberties had also been guaranteed
by the constitution of 1850, had
shown itself unable to profit by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_790" id="Page_790">[790]</a></span>
greater freedom of action which it
had received. In fact, the Evangelical
Church was lifeless, and it needed
only this test to prove its want
of vitality. It was a state creation,
and in an age when the world had
ceased to recognize the divine
right of kings to create religions.
It was only in 1817 that the Lutheran
and Calvinistic churches of
Prussia, together with the very
name of Protestant, were abolished
by royal edict, and a new Prussian
establishment, under the title of
“evangelical,” was imposed by the
civil power upon a Protestant population
of nearly eight millions,
whose religious and moral sense
was so dead that they seemed to
regard with stolid indifference this
interference of government with all
that freemen deem most sacred
in life. Acts of parliament may
make “establishments,” but they
cannot inspire religious faith and
life; and it was therefore not surprising
that, when the mummy of
evangelicalism was put out into
the open air of freedom by the constitution
of 1850, it should have
been revealed to all that the thing
was dead.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Prussian government
continued to act toward
the Catholic Church with great justice,
and even friendliness, and the
war against Catholic Austria in 1866
wrought no change in its ecclesiastical
policy. Even the opening
of the Vatican Council caused no
alarm in Prussia; on the contrary,
King William, as it was generally
believed at least, was most civil to
the Holy Father; and Prince Bismarck
himself at that time saw no
reason for apprehension, though he
had been the head of the ministry
already eight years. To what, then,
are we to attribute Prussia’s sudden
change of attitude toward the
church? Who began the present
conflict, and what was its provocation?</p>

<p>This is a question which has
been much discussed in the Prussian
House of Deputies and elsewhere.
Prince Bismarck has openly
asserted in the House of Deputies
within the past year that the provocation
was the definition of papal
infallibility by the Vatican Council
on the 18th of June, 1870, and
subsequently the hostile attitude of
the party of the <i lang="de">Centrum</i> toward the
German Empire.</p>

<p>Herr von Kirchmann, a member
of the German Parliament and of
the Prussian House of Deputies, a
national liberal, and not a Catholic,
but in the main a sympathizer with
the spirit of the Falk legislation, has
recently discussed this whole subject
with great ability, and&mdash;as far
as it is possible for one who believes
in the Hegelian doctrine that “the
state is the present god”&mdash;also with
fairness.<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>To Prince Bismarck’s first assertion,
that the definition of papal
infallibility was the unpardonable
offence, which has been so strongly
emphasized by Mr. Gladstone and
re-echoed with parrot-like fidelity
by the anti-Catholic press of Europe
and America, Herr von Kirchmann
makes the following reply:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is difficult to understand how so
experienced a statesman as Prince Bismarck
can ascribe to this decree of the
council such great importance for the
states of Europe, and particularly for
Prussia and Germany. To a theorizer
sitting behind his books such a decree,
it may be allowed, might appear
to be something portentous, since,
taken from a purely theoretical stand-point
and according to the letter, the infallibility
of the Pope in all questions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_791" id="Page_791">[791]</a></span>
religion and morals gives him unlimited
control over all human action; and
many a Catholic, when called upon to receive
this infallibility as part of his faith,
may have found that he was unable to
follow so far; but a statesman ought to
know how to distinguish, especially
where there is question of the Catholic
Church, between the literal import of
dogmas and their use in practical life.
In the Catholic Church as a whole, this
infallibility, as is well known, has existed
from the earliest times; its organ hitherto
has been the Ecumenical Council in
union with the Pope; but already before
1870 it was disputed whether the Pope
might not alone act as the organ of infallibility.
In 1870 the question was decided
in favor of the Pope; but we must
consider that the ecumenical councils
have, as history shows, nearly always
framed their decrees in accordance with
the views of the court of Rome; and this,
of itself, proves that the change made in
1870 is rather one of form than of essence.
Especially false is it to maintain
that by this decree a complete revolution
in the constitution of the church has
been made. To the theorizer we might
grant the abstract possibility that something
of this kind might some day or
other happen; but such <em>possibilities</em> of
the abuse of a right are found in all the
relations of public life, in the state and
its representatives as well as in the
church. Even in constitutions the most
carefully drawn up such possibilities are
found in all directions. What a statesman
has to consider is not mere possibilities,
but the question whether the
possessor of such right is not compelled,
from the very nature of things, to make
of it only the most moderate and prudent
use. So long, therefore, as the Pope
does not alter the constitution of the
church, that constitution remains, precisely
in its ancient form, such as it has
been recognized and tolerated by the
state for centuries: and wherever the relations
between particular states and the
court of Rome have been arranged by
concordats, these too remain unchanged,
unless the states themselves find it convenient
to depart from them. We see, in
fact, that this infallibility of the Pope has
in no country of Europe or America altered
one jot or tittle in the constitution
of the Catholic Church; and where in
particular countries such changes have
taken place, they have not been made by
the ecclesiastical government, but by the
state and in its interest. In Germany
even, and in Prussia itself, the Pope has,
since 1870, made no change in the church
constitution, as determined by the Canon
Law; and when, in some of his encyclicals
and other utterances, he has taken
up a hostile attitude towards the German
Empire and the Prussian state, he has
done this only in defence against the aggressive
legislation of the civil government.
He has never hesitated to express
his disapprobation of the new church
laws, but he has in no instance touched
the constitution of the Catholic Church
or the rights of the bishops.”<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It seems almost needless to remark
that there is no necessary connection
between the doctrine of
Papal infallibility and that of the essential
organization of the church;
that the jurisdiction of the Pope
was as great, and universally recognized
as such by Catholics, before
the Vatican Council as since;
and consequently that it is not
even possible that the definition of
1870 should make any change in
his authoritative relation to, or power
over, the church. His jurisdiction
is wider than his infallibility,
and independent of it; and the
duty of obedience to his commands
existed before the dogma was defined
precisely as it exists now;
and therefore it is clearly manifest
that the Vatican decree cannot
give even a plausible pretext for
such legislation as the Falk Laws.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Not less singular,” continues Herr
von Kirchmann, “does it sound to hear
the party of the <i lang="de">Centrum</i> in the Reichstag
and Prussian Landtag denounced
as the occasion of the new regulations
between church and state. The members
of this party notoriously represent
the views and wishes of the majority of
their constituents, and just as faithfully
as the members of the parties who side
with the government. The reproach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_792" id="Page_792">[792]</a></span>
that they receive their instructions from
Rome is not borne out by the facts; and
if there were an understanding with
Rome of the kind which their adversaries
affirm, this could only be the result of a
similar understanding on the part of
their constituents. Nothing could more
strikingly prove that the Catholic party
faithfully represent the great majority in
their electoral districts than the repeated
re-election of the same representatives or
of men of similar views. To this we must
add that the <i lang="de">Centrum</i>, though strong in
numbers, is yet in a decided minority
both in the Reichstag and the Prussian
Landtag, and has always been defeated
in its opposition to the recent ecclesiastical
legislation. If in other matters, by
uniting with opposition parties, it has
caused the government inconvenience,
we have no right to ascribe this to
feelings of hostility; for on such occasions
its orators have given substantial
political reasons for their opposition,
and instances enough might be enumerated
in which, precisely through the aid
of the <i lang="de">Centrum</i>, many illiberal and dangerous
projects of law have fallen
through; and for this the party deserves
the thanks of the country.</p>

<p>“The present action of the state against
the Catholic Church would be unjustifiable,
if better grounds could not be adduced
in its favor. For the attentive observer,
however, valid reasons are not wanting.
They are to be found, to put the whole
matter in a single word, in the great
power to which the Catholic Church in
Prussia had attained by the aid of the
constitution and the favor of the government&mdash;a
power which, if its growth had
been longer tolerated, would have become,
not indeed dangerous to the existence
of the state, but a hindrance to
the right fulfilment of the ends of its
existence.”<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Neither the Vatican Council,
then, nor the Catholics of Prussia
have done anything to provoke the
present persecution. To find fault
with the German bishops for accepting
the dogma of infallibility,
after having strongly opposed its
definition by the council, would be
as unreasonable as to blame a member
of Congress for admitting the
binding force of a law the passage
of which he had done everything in
his power to prevent. Their duty,
beyond all question, was to act as
they have acted. This was not the
offence: the unpardonable crime
was that the church, as soon as she
was unloosed from the fetters of
bureaucracy, had grown too powerful.
We doubt whether any more
forcible argument in proof of the
indestructible vitality of the church
can be found than that which may
be deduced from the universal consent
of her enemies, of whatever
shade of belief or unbelief, that the
only way in which she can be successfully
opposed is to array against
her the strongest of human powers&mdash;that
of the state. A complete revolution
of thought upon this subject
has taken place within the last
half-century. Up to that time it
was confidently held by Protestants
as well as infidels that, to undermine
and finally destroy the church, it
would be simply necessary to withdraw
from her the support of the
state; that to her freedom would
necessarily prove fatal. The experiment,
as it was thought, had not
been satisfactorily tried. Ireland,
indeed, had held her faith for three
hundred years, in spite of all that
fiendish cruelty could invent to destroy
it; but persecution has always
been the life of the faith. In the
United States the church had been
free since the war of independence,
but of us little was known; and, besides,
down to, say, 1830 even the
most thoughtful and far-sighted
among us had serious doubts as to
the future of the church in this
country.</p>

<p>But with the emancipation of the
Catholics in Great Britain, the new
constitution of the kingdom of Belgium,
and the completer organization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_793" id="Page_793">[793]</a></span>
of the church in the United
States, the test as to the action
of freedom upon the progress of
Catholic faith began to be applied
over a wide and varied field and
under not unfavorable circumstances.
What the result has been we
may learn from our enemies. Mr.
Gladstone expostulates for Great
Britain, and reaches a hand of sympathy
to M. Emile de Laveleye in
Belgium. Dr. Falk, Dr. Friedberg,
and even the moderate Herr von
Kirchmann, defend the tyrannical
<cite>May Laws</cite> as necessary to stop the
growth of the church in Germany;
and at home the most silent of Presidents
and the most garrulous of
bishops, forgetting that the cause
of temperance has prior claims upon
their attention, have raised the cry
of alarm to warn their fellow-citizens
of the dangerous progress of
popery in this great and free country.
Time was when “the Free
Church in the Free State” was
thought to be the proper word of
command; but now it is “the
Fettered Church in the Enslaved
State,” since no state that meddles
with the consciences of its subjects
can be free.</p>

<p>If there is anything for which we
feel more especially thankful, it is
that henceforth the cause of the
church and the cause of freedom
are inseparably united. We have
heard to satiety that the Catholic
Church is the greatest conservative
force in the world, the most powerful
element of order in society, the
noblest school of respect in which
mankind have ever been taught.
Praised be God that now, as in the
early days, he is making it impossible
that Catholics should not be on the
side of liberty, as the church has always
been; so that all men may see
that, if we love order the more, we
love not liberty the less!</p>

<p>“I will sing to my God as long at
I shall be,” wrote an inspired king;
“put not your trust in princes.”
No, nor in governments, nor in
states, but in God who is the Lord,
and in the poor whom Jesus loved.
From God out of the people came
the church; through God back to
the people is she going. We know
there are still many Catholics who
trust in kings and believe in salvation
through them; but God will
make them wiser. The Spirit that
sits at the roaring Loom of Time
will weave for them other garments.
The irresistible charm of
the church, humanly speaking, lies
in the fact that she comes closer to
the hearts of the people than any
other power that has ever been
brought to bear upon mankind.</p>

<p>Having shown that the oppressive
ecclesiastical legislation of
Germany was not provoked by the
church, and that its only excuse
is the increasing power of the
church, Herr von Kirchmann reduces
all farther discussion of this
subject to the two following heads:
1st. How far ought the state to
go in setting bounds to this power
of the Catholic Church? and 2d.
What means ought it to employ?</p>

<p>In view of the dangers with which
every open breach of the peace between
church and state is fraught
for the people, it would have been
advisable, he thinks, from political
motives, to have tried to settle the
difficulty by a mutual understanding
between the two powers; nor
would it, in his opinion, be derogatory
to the sovereignty of the state
to treat the church as an equal,
since she embraces in her fold all
the Catholics of the world, who
have their directing head in the
Pope, whose sovereign ecclesiastical
power cannot, therefore, as a
matter of fact, be called in question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_794" id="Page_794">[794]</a></span></p>

<p>That Prussia did not make any
effort to see what could be effected
by this policy of conciliation may,
in the opinion of Herr von Kirchmann,
find some justification in the
fact that the government did not
expect, and could not in 1871 foresee,
the determined opposition of
the Catholics to the May Laws of
1873. At any rate, as he thinks,
the high and majestatic right of the
state is supreme, and it alone must
determine, in the ultimate instance,
how far and how long it will acknowledge
any claim of the church.
Thus even this statesman, who is
of the more moderate school of
Prussian politicians, holds that the
church has no rights which the
state is bound to respect; that
political interests are paramount,
and conscience, in the modern as
in the ancient pagan state, has no
claim upon the recognition of the
government. English and American
Protestants, where their own
interests are concerned, would be
as little inclined to accept this
doctrine as Catholics; in fact, this
country was born of a protest
against the assumption of state
supremacy over conscience; and
yet so blinding and misleading is
prejudice that the Falk Laws receive
their heart-felt sympathy.</p>

<p>Though Herr von Kirchmann
accepts without reservation the
principles which underlie the recent
Prussian anti-Catholic legislation,
and thinks the May Laws
have been drawn up with great
wisdom and consummate knowledge
of the precise points at
which the state should oppose the
growing power of the church, he
yet freely admits that there are
grave doubts whether the present
policy of Prussia on this subject
can be successfully carried out.
That Prince Bismarck and Dr. Falk
had but a very imperfect knowledge
of the difficulties which lay
in their path, the numerous supplementary
bills which have been repeatedly
introduced in order to
give effect to the May Laws plainly
show. Where there is question of
principle and of conscience Prince
Bismarck is not at home. He believes
in force; like the first Napoleon,
holds that Providence is always
on the side of the biggest
cannons; sneers about going to
Canossa, as Napoleon mockingly
asked the pope whether his excommunication
would make the arms
fall from the hands of his veterans.
He knows the workings of courts,
and is a master in the devious
ways of diplomacy. He can estimate
with great precision the resources
of a country; he has a
keen eye for the weak points of an
adversary. His tactics, like Napoleon’s,
are to bring to bear upon
each given point of attack a force
greater than the enemy’s. He has,
in his public life, never known
what it is to respect right or principle.
With the army at his back
he has trampled upon the Prussian
constitution with the same daring
recklessness with which he now
violates the most sacred rights of
conscience. Nothing, in his eyes, is
holy but success, and he has been
consecrated by it, so that the Bismarck-cultus
has spread far beyond
the fatherland to England and
the United States. Carlyle has at
last found a living hero, the very
impersonation of the brute force
which to him is ideal and admirable;
and at eighty he offers incense
and homage to the idol. We
freely give Prince Bismarck credit
for his remarkable gifts&mdash;indomitable
will, reckless courage, practical
knowledge of men, considered
as intelligent automata whose movements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_795" id="Page_795">[795]</a></span>
are directed by a kind of
bureaucratic and military mechanism;
and this is the kind of men
with whom, for the most part, he
has had to deal. For your thorough
Prussian, though the wildest
of speculators and the boldest of
theorizers, is the tamest of animals.
No poor Russian soldier ever
crouched more submissively beneath
the knout than do the Prussian
pantheists and culturists beneath
the lash of a master. Like
Voltaire, they probably prefer the
rule of one fine Lion to that of a
hundred rats of their own sort.
Prince Bismarck knew his men, and
we give him credit for his sagacity.
Not every eye could have pierced
the mist, and froth, and sound, and
fury of German professordom, and
beheld the craven heart that was
beneath.</p>

<p>Only men who believe in God
and the soul are dangerous rebels.
Why should he who has no faith
make a martyr of himself? Why,
since there is nothing but law, blind
and merciless force, throw yourself
beneath the wheels of the state
Juggernaut to be crushed? The
religion of culture is the religion of
indulgence, and no godlike rebel
against tyranny and brute force
ever sprang from such worship.
So long as Prince Bismarck had to
deal with men who were nourished
on “philosophy’s sweet milk,” and
who worshipped at the altar of culture,
who had science but not
faith, opinions but not convictions,
amongst whom, consequently, organic
union was impossible, his policy
of making Germany “by blood and
iron” was successful enough. But,
like all great conquerors, he longed
for more kingdoms to subdue, and
finding right around him a large and
powerful body of German citizens
who did not accept the “new faith”
that the state&mdash;in other words,
Prince Bismarck&mdash;is “the present
god,” just as a kind of diversion
between victories, he turned to give
a lesson to the <i lang="de">Pfaffen</i> and clerical
<i lang="de">Dummköpfe</i>, who burnt no incense
in honor of his divinity. In taking
this step it is almost needless to
say that Prince Bismarck sought to
pass over a chasm which science
itself does not profess to have bridged&mdash;that,
namely, which lies between
the worlds of matter and of spirit.
Of the new conflict upon which
he was entering he could have
only vague and inaccurate notions.
Nothing is so misleading as contempt&mdash;a
feeling in which the wise
never indulge, but which easily becomes
habitual with men spoiled
by success. To the man who had
organized the armies and guided
the policy which had triumphed at
Sadowa and Sedan what opposition
could be made by a few poor priests
and beggar-monks? Would the
arms fall from the hands of the
proudest soldiers of Europe because
the <i lang="de">Pfaffen</i> were displeased?
Or why should not the model culture-state
of the world make war
upon ignorance and superstition?</p>

<p>Of the real nature and strength
of the forces which would be marshalled
in this great battle of souls
a man of blood and iron could form
no just estimate. “To those who
believe,” said Christ, “all things are
possible”; but what meaning have
these words for Prince Bismarck?
The soul, firm in its faith, appealing
from tyrant kings and states to
God, is invincible. Lifting itself to
the Infinite, it draws thence a divine
power. Like liberty, it is brightest
in dungeons, in fetters freest,
and conquers with its martyrdom.
Needle-guns cannot reach it, and
above the deadly roar of cannon it
rises godlike and supreme.</p>

<p>Who has ever forgotten those
lines of Tacitus, inserted as an
altogether trifling circumstance in
the reign of Nero?&mdash;“So for the
quieting of this rumor [of his having
set fire to Rome] Nero judicially
charged with the crime, and punished
with most studied severities,
that class, hated for their general
wickedness, whom the vulgar call
<em>Christians</em>. The originator of that
name was one <em>Christ</em>, who in the
reign of Tiberius suffered death by
sentence of the procurator, Pontius
Pilate. The baneful superstition,
thereby repressed for the time,
again broke out, not only over Judea,
the native soil of the mischief,
but in the City also, where from
every side all atrocious and abominable
things collect and flourish.”<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>“Tacitus,” says Carlyle, referring
to this passage, “was the wisest,
most penetrating man of his generation;
and to such depth, and no
deeper, has he seen into this transaction,
the most important that has
occurred or can occur in the annals
of mankind.”</p>

<p>We doubt whether Prince Bismarck
to-day has any truer knowledge
of the real worth and power
of the living Catholic faith on which
he is making war than had Tacitus
eighteen hundred years ago, when
writing of the rude German barbarians
who were hovering on the
confines of the Roman Empire,
and who were to have a history in
the world only through the action
of that “baneful superstition” which
he considered as one of the most
abominable products of the frightful
corruptions of his age.</p>

<p>That the Prussian government
was altogether unprepared for the
determined though passive opposition
to the May Laws which the
Catholics have made, Herr von
Kirchmann freely confesses. It
was not expected that there would
be such perfect union between the
clergy and the people; on the contrary,
it was generally supposed
that, with the aid of the Draconian
penalties threatened for the violation
of the Falk Laws, the resistance
of the priests themselves would
be easily overcome. These men
love their own comfort too much,
said the culturists, to be willing to
go to prison and live on beans and
water for the sake of technicalities;
and so they chuckled over their
pipes and lager-beer at the thought
of their easy victory over the <i lang="de">Pfaffen</i>.
They were mistaken, and
Herr von Kirchmann admits that the
courage of the bishops and priests
has not been broken but strengthened
by their sufferings for the
faith.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“So long as we were permitted to
hope,” he says, “that we should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_797" id="Page_797">[797]</a></span>
only the priests to deal with, there was
less reason for doubt as to the policy of
executing the laws in all their rigor; but
the situation was wholly altered when it
became manifest that the congregations
held the same views as the bishops and
priests.… It is easy to see that all
violent, even though legal, proceedings
of the government against these convictions
of the Catholic people can only
weaken those proper, and in the last instance
alone effective, measures through
which the May Laws can successfully
put bounds to the growing power of the
church. These measures&mdash;viz., a better
education of the people and a higher
culture of the priests&mdash;can, from the nature
of things, exert their influence only
by degrees. Not till the next generation
can we hope to gather the fruit of this
seed; and not then, indeed, if the reckless
execution of the May Laws calls
forth an opposition in the Catholic populations
which will shake confidence in
the just intentions of the government,
and beget in the congregations feelings
of hatred for everything connected with
this legislation. Such feelings will unavoidably
be communicated to the children,
and the teacher will in consequence
be deprived of that authority without
which his instructions must lack the
persuasive force that is inherent in truth.
In such a state of warfare even the higher
culture of the clergy must be useless.
Those who stand on the side of the government
will, precisely on that account,
fail to win the confidence of their people;
and the stronger the aged pastors
emphasize the Canon Law of the church,
the more energetically they extend the
realms of faith even to the hierarchical
constitution of the church, the more
readily and faithfully will their congregations
follow them.</p>

<p>“It cannot be dissembled that the
government, through the rigorous execution
of the May Laws, is raging against
its own flesh and blood, and is thereby
robbing itself of the only means by
which it can have any hope of finally
coming forth victorious from the present
conflict. It may be objected that the resistance
which is now so widespread
cannot be much longer maintained, and
that all that is needed to crush it and
bring about peace with the church is to
increase the pressure of the law. Assertions
of this kind are made with great
confidence by the liberals of both
Houses of the Landtag whenever the
government presents a new bill; and the
liberal newspapers, which never grow
tired of this theme, declare that the result
is certain and even near at hand.</p>

<p>“Now, even though we should attach
no importance to the contrary assertions
of the Catholic party, it is yet evident,
from the declarations of the government
itself, that it is not all confident of reaching
this result with the aid of the means
which it has hitherto employed or of
those in preparation, but that it is making
ready for a prolonged resistance of
the clergy, who are upheld and supported
by the great generosity of the Catholic
people. The ovations which the
priests receive from their congregations
when they come forth from prison are
not falling off, but are increasing; and
this is equally true of the pecuniary aid
given to them. It is possible that much
of this may have been gotten up by the
priests themselves as demonstration;
but the displeasure of the still powerful
government officials which the participants
incur, and the greatness of the
money-offerings, are evidence of earnest
convictions.</p>

<p>“Nothing, however, so strongly witnesses
to the existence of a perfect understanding
between the congregations
and the priests as the fact that, though
the law of May, 1874, gave to those congregations
whose pastors had been removed
or had not been legally appointed
by the bishops the right to elect a pastor,
yet not even one congregation has
up to the present moment made any use
of this privilege. When we consider
that the number of parishes where there
is no pastor must be at least a hundred;
that in itself such right of choice corresponds
with the wishes of the congregations;
farther, that the law requires for
the validity of the election merely a majority
of the members who put in an appearance;
that a proposition made to
the <i lang="de">Landrath</i> by ten parishioners justifies
him in ordering an election; and
that, on the part of the influential officials
and their organs, nothing has been left
undone to induce the congregations to
demand elections, not easily could a
more convincing proof of the perfect
agreement of the people with their
priests be found than the fact that to
this day in only two or three congregations
has it been possible to hunt up ten
men who were willing to make such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_798" id="Page_798">[798]</a></span>
proposal, and that not even in a single
congregation has an election of this kind
taken place.”<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This is indeed admirable; and it
may, we think, be fairly doubted
whether, in the whole history of the
church, so large a Catholic population
has ever, under similar trials,
shown greater strength or constancy.
Of the peculiar nature of
these trials we shall speak hereafter;
the present article we will bring
to a close with a few remarks upon
what we conceive to have been one
of the most important agencies in
bringing about the perfect unanimity
and harmony of action between
priests and people to which
the Catholics of Prussia must in
great measure ascribe their immovable
firmness in the presence
of a most terrible foe. We refer
to those Catholic associations in
which cardinals, bishops, priests,
and people have been brought into
immediate contact, uniting their
wisdom and strength for the attainment
of definite ends.</p>

<p>Such unions have nowhere been
more numerous or more thoroughly
organized than in Germany, though
their formation is of recent date.
It was during the revolution of
1848, of which we have already
spoken, that the German Catholics
were roused to a more comprehensive
knowledge of the situation, and
resolved to combine for the defence
of their rights and the protection
of their religion. Popular unions
under the name and patronage of
Pius IX. (Pius-Vereine) were formed
throughout the fatherland, with
the primary object of bringing together
once a week large numbers
of Catholic men of every condition
in life. At these weekly meetings
the questions of the day, in so far
as they touched upon Catholic
interests, were freely discussed, and
thus an intelligent and enlightened
Catholic public opinion was created
throughout the length and breadth
of the land. In refuting calumnies
against the church the speakers
never failed to demand the fullest
liberty for all Catholic institutions.</p>

<p>On the occasion of beginning the
restoration and completion of the
Cathedral of Cologne, the most religious
of churches, the proposition
that an annual General Assembly
of all the unions should be
held was made and received with
boundless enthusiasm. The first
General Assembly took place at
Mayence in October, 1848; and
thither came delegates from Austria,
Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, Hanover,
and all the other states of
Germany, whose confidence and
earnestness were increased by the
presence of the Catholic members
of the Parliament of Frankfort.
For the first time since Luther’s
apostasy the Catholics of Germany
breathed the air of liberty. The
bishops assembled at Würzburg,
gave their solemn approbation to
the great work, and Pius IX. sent
his apostolic benediction. Since
that time General Assemblies have
been held at Breslau, May, 1849;
Ratisbon, October, 1849; Linz,
1850; Mayence, 1851; Münster,
1852; Vienna, 1853; Linz, 1856;
Salzburg, 1857; Cologne, 1858;
Freyburg, 1859; Prague, 1860; Munich,
1861; Aix-la-Chapelle, 1862;
Frankfort, 1863, and in other cities,
down to the recent persecutions.</p>

<p>These assemblies represented a
complete system of organization, in
which no Catholic interest was forgotten.
Every village and hamlet
in the land was there, if not immediately,
through some central union.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_799" id="Page_799">[799]</a></span>
We have had the honor of being
present at more than one of these
assemblies, and the impressions
which we then received are abiding.
Side by side with cardinals,
bishops, princes, noblemen, and the
most learned of professors sat mechanics,
carpenters, shoemakers, and
blacksmiths&mdash;not as in the act of
worship, in which the presence of
the Most High God dwarfs our
universal human littlenesses to the
dead-level of an equal insignificance,
but in active thought and
co-operation for the furtherance
of definite religious and social
ends. The brotherhood of the
race was there, an accomplished
fact, and one felt the breathing
as of a divine Spirit compared
with whose irresistible force great
statesmen and mighty armies are
weak as the puppets of a child’s
show.</p>

<p>We have not the space to describe
more minutely the ends,
aims, and workings of the numberless
Catholic associations of Germany;
but we must express our
deep conviction that no study could
be more replete with lessons of
practical wisdom for the Catholics
of the United States. Organization
is precisely what we most lack.
Our priests are laborious, our people
are devoted, but we have not
even an organized Catholic public
opinion&mdash;nay, no organ to serve as
its channel, and make itself heard
of the whole country. Many seem
to think that the very question of
the necessity of Catholic education
is still an open one for us;
and this is not surprising, since
we have no system of Catholic
education. Catholic schools, indeed,
in considerable number, there
are, but there is no organization.
The great need of the church in
this country is the organization of
priests and people for the promotion
of Catholic interests. Through
this we will learn to know one another;
our views will be enlarged,
our sympathies deepened, and the
truth will dawn upon us that, if we
wish to be true to the great mission
which God has given us, the time
has come when American Catholics
must take up works which do
not specially concern any one diocese
more than another, but whose
significance will be as wide as the
nation’s life.</p>

<h3>A STORY WITH TWO VERSIONS.</h3>

<p>Yes, sir, this is Brentwood. And
you are of the race, you say, though
not of the name. Clarkson, sir?
Surely, surely. I remember well.
Miss Jane Brent&mdash;the first Miss
Brent I can recall&mdash;married a
Clarkson. So you are her grandson,
sir? Then you are right welcome
to me and mine. Come in,
come in. Or, if you will do me the
honor, sit here in the porch, sir,
and my Kate will bring you of her
best, and right glad will we be to
wait again on one with the Brent
blood in him.</p>

<p>None of the name left? Ah! Mr.
Clarkson, have you never heard,
then? But you must have heard
of James Brent. Surely, surely.
He lives still, God pity him!
What’s that? You want to hear
the story out? Well, sir, no man
living can tell you better than I,
unless it be Mr. James’ self. Settle
yourself comfortably, Mr. Clarkson,
and I’ll tell you all.</p>

<p>Yes, this is Brentwood. ’Twas
your great-great-grandsire founded
it, two hundred years back, he and
his brother&mdash;James and William.
They began the work which was
to grow and grow into foundries
and factories, and the bank that
was to ruin all. But I’m telling
the end afore the beginning.
The next two brothers built the
church you see there, sir, down
the road; and the next two after
them added the tower and founded
the almshouses; and then came
the fourth James and William Brent,
and one of them was an idiot, and
the other was and is the last of the
name.</p>

<p>I was twenty years older than
Mr. James, and, before ever he
came into business, had served with
his father. I watched him grow
up, and I loved him well. But from
the first I knew he was different
from the rest of his race. He was
his mother all over again&mdash;a true
Mortimer, come of nobles, not of
townsfolk; all fire and sweetness
and great plans for people’s good
and happiness, but with little of
the far-sighted Brent prudence.
He was just as tender of Mr. William
as if he had had all the wits
of himself, and used to spend part
of every day with him, and amuse
him part of many a night when the
poor gentleman could not sleep.</p>

<p>Their father died just when they
came of age. They were twins, the
last Brent Brothers, sir; and ’twas
a great fortune and responsibility
to fall full and with no restraint
into such young hands. Mr. James
seemed like one heart-broken for
nigh a year after, and carried on
everything just as his father had
done, till we all wondered at it;
then he saw Miss Rose Maurice,
and loved her&mdash;as well indeed he
might&mdash;and after that things changed.
She was as simple in all her ways
as she was beautiful, and would
have thought my cottage good
enough, so long as he was in it with
her. But he!&mdash;well, sir, I know he
has kissed the very ground she
trod on, and he didn’t think a
queen’s palace too fine for her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_801" id="Page_801">[801]</a></span>
As soon as ever he saw her he
loved her and set his soul to win
her; and the very next day he
began a new home in Brentwood.
Where is it? Alack! alack! sir.
Wait till ye <em>must</em> hear. Let’s think,
for a bit, of only the glad days
now.</p>

<p>You could not call it extravagance
exactly. It set the whole
town alive. So far as he could, he
would have none but Brentwood
folk to work upon the place where
his bride was to dwell. And he
said it was time that so old a family
should have a home that would
last as long as they. Ah! me, as
long as they!</p>

<p>Of course there was a city architect
and a grand landscape gardener;
but, oh! the thoughtfulness of
him whom we were proud to call
our master. There, in the very flush
of his youth and love and hope,
he took care of the widows and the
little children; contrived to make
work for them; was here and there
and everywhere; and there was
not a beggar nor an idler in Brentwood&mdash;not
one. The house rose
stately and tall; he had chosen a
fair spot for it, where great trees
grew and brooks were running, all
ready to his hand; and that city
man&mdash;why, sir, ’twas marvellous
how he seemed to understand just
how to make use of it all, and to
prune a little here and add a little
there, with vines and arbors and
glades and a wilderness, till you
didn’t know what God had done
and what he had given his creatures
wit to do. And in the sunniest
corner of the house&mdash;Brent Hall,
as they called it&mdash;Mr. James chose
rooms for Mr. William, who was
pleased as a child with it all, and
used to sit day by day and watch
the work go on.</p>

<p>All the time, too, the Brent iron-foundries
were being added to
and renovated, till there was none
like them round about; and the
town streets were made like city
streets, and the town itself set into
such order as never before; and
when all was ready&mdash;’twas the work
of but three years, sir&mdash;when the
house was hung with pictures and
decked with the best; in the spring,
when the grass and the trees were
green, and the flowers were blooming
fair, then he brought her
home. And when I saw her&mdash;well,
sir, first I thought of the angels;
but next (if I may say it; and I wot
it is not wrong)&mdash;next I thought
of our Blessed Lady. There was
a great painting in the Hall oratory&mdash;by
some Spanish painter, they
said. Murillo? Yes, sir, that is the
name. It looked like Mrs. James
Brent, sir. Not an angel, but a
woman that could suffer and weep
and struggle sore; and, pure and
stainless, would still remember she
was of us poor humans, and so pity
and pray for us.</p>

<p>We had been used to have Mr.
Brent come into our houses, and to
see him in the poorest cottages and
the almshouses, with smiles and
cheery words and money; but Mrs.
James gave more than that, for she
gave herself. I’ve seen those soft
hands bind wounds I shrank from;
and that delicate creature&mdash;I’ve
seen her kneeling by beds of dying
sinners, while her face grew white
at what she saw and heard, and
yet she praying over ’em, and, what’s
more, <em>loving</em> ’em, till she made the
way for the priest to come. And
she laid out dead whom few of us
would have touched for hire, and
she listened to the stories of the
sad and tiresome, and her smile
was sunshine, and the very sight
of her passing by lifted up our
minds to God. Her husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_802" id="Page_802">[802]</a></span>
thwarted her in nothing. What
was there to thwart her in? He
loved her, and she should do what
she would in this work which was
her heart’s joy.</p>

<p>Then we had been used to see
Mr. James in church regular, weekday
Mass and Sunday Mass; but
Mrs. James was there any time,
early mornings and noons and
nights. I fancy she loved it better
than the stately Hall. After she
came, her husband added the great
south transept window from Germany,
and the organ that people
came miles to hear; and he said it
was her gift, not his. The window
picture is a great Crucifixion and
Our Lady standing by. You’ll understand
better, Mr. Clarkson, ere
I finish, what it says to Brentwood
folk now.</p>

<p>The first year there was a daughter
only; but the next there came
a son. After that, for six long years
there were no more children, but
then another son saw the light.
What rejoicings, what bonfires,
what clanging of bells, there was!
But ere night the clanging changed
to tolling and the shouts to tears;
for the child died. And when Mrs.
James came among us again, very
white and changed and feeble, we
all knew that with Mr. James and
Mr. William, we were seeing the
last Brent Brothers, whatever our
grandchildren might see.</p>

<p>However, <em>she</em> was spared, and
Mr. James took heart of such grace
as that, and said it would be Brent
and Son, which sounded quite as
well when one was used to it.
And to make himself used to it&mdash;or
to stifle the disappointment, as I
really think&mdash;he began the Brent
Bank. There had been a Brent
Bank here for years past, and to it
all Brentwood and half the country
round trusted their earnings. Only
a few really rich people had much
to do with it, but men in moderate
circumstances, young doctors and
lawyers with growing families, widows,
orphans, seamstresses, the factory
people, laborers, thought there
was no bank like that. Mr. James’
kind spirit showed itself there as
elsewhere, and nobody felt himself
too insignificant to come there, if
only with a penny.</p>

<p>Often and often I sit here and
wonder, Mr. Clarkson, why it all
was&mdash;why God ever let it be&mdash;the
shame and the sorrow and the suffering
that came. I know Mr.
James was lavish, but, if he spent
much on himself, he spent much
on others too; and he made God’s
house as beautiful as his own.
For a time it looked as if God’s
blessing was on him; for he prospered
year by year, and, except for his
child’s dying and his wife’s frail
health, his cup of joy seemed running
over.</p>

<p>By and by came a year&mdash;you
may just remember it, sir&mdash;a year
of very hard times for the whole
country. Banks broke, and old
houses went by the board, and men
were thrown out of work, and there
was a cry of distress through all
the land. But Brentwood folk
hadn’t a thought of fear. Still, in
that year, from the very first of it,
something troubled me. Master
was moody now and then; went
up to the city oftener; had letters
which he did not show to me, who
had seen all his business correspondence
and his father’s for thirty
years and more. Sometimes he
missed Mass, and presently I noted
with a pang that he did not receive
the Blessed Sacrament regular as
he used. And Mrs. James was
pale, and her eyes, that once were
as bright and clear as sunshine,
grew heavy and dark, and she looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_803" id="Page_803">[803]</a></span>
more and more like the picture
in her oratory; but it made one
very sad somehow to see the likeness.</p>

<p>The hard times began at midsummer.
The Lent after there
was a mission of Dominican friars
here. I was special busy that
week, and kept at work till after
midnight. One evening, about
eight, Mr. James came hurriedly
into the office and asked for the letters.
He turned them over, looked
blank, then said the half-past eleven
mail would surely bring the one he
wanted, and he should wait till
then and go for it himself. For
five minutes or so he tried to cast
up some accounts; then, too nervous-like
to be quiet longer, he
said: “I’ll go and hear the sermon,
Serle. It will serve to fill up the
time.” And off he went.</p>

<p>The clock struck the hour and
the half-hour, and the hour and the
half-hour, and I heard the half-past
eleven mail come in, and, soon after,
Mr. James’ step again, but slow now,
like one in deep thought. In he
came, and I caught a glimpse of
his face, pale and stern, with the
lips hard set. He shut himself into
his private room, and I heard
him pacing up and down; then
there came a pause, and he strode
out again. He seemed very odd to
me, but he tried to laugh, as he
put down two slips for telegrams
on my desk. “Which would you
send?” said he.</p>

<p>One was, “Go on. I consent to
all your terms.” The other was,
“Stop. I will have nothing more
to do with it, no matter what happens.”</p>

<p>Something told me in my heart
that, though he was trying to pass
this off in his old way like a joke,
my master&mdash;my dear master&mdash;was
in a great strait. I looked up and
answered what he had not said at
all to get an answer, with words
which rose to my lips in spite of
myself. Says I: “Send what Mrs.
James would want you to send,
sir.” And then his ruddy, kind
face bleached gray like ashes, and
he gave a groan, and the next minute
he was gone.</p>

<p>Though my work was done for
that night, I would not leave the
bank; for I thought he might come
back. And back he did come, a
full hour after, steady and grave
and not like my master. For, Mr.
Clarkson, the bright boy-look I
had loved so, which, with the boy-nature
too, had never seemed to
leave him, was all gone out of his
face, and I knew surely I never
should see it there again. He
wrote something quickly, then
handed it to me, bidding me send
telegrams to the bank trustees as
there ordered. The slip which
bore my direction bore also the
words, with just a pencil-line erasure
through them, “Go on. I consent
to all your terms.” So, for
good or for ill, whichever it might
be, the other was the one he must
have sent.</p>

<p>These telegrams notified the trustees
of a most important meeting
to which they were summoned, and
at that meeting I had, as usual, to
be present. Perhaps his colleagues
saw no change in him; but I, who
had served him long, saw much.
O Mr. Clarkson, Mr. Clarkson!
whatever you may be&mdash;and you are
young still&mdash;<em>be honest</em>. For, sir,
there’s one thing of many terrible
to bear, and it’s got to be borne
here or hereafter by them as err
from uprightness; and that thing
is shame. I’d seen him kneel at
the altar that morning, and she beside
him, bless her! That’s where
he got strength to endure the penance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_804" id="Page_804">[804]</a></span>
he had brought upon himself;
else I don’t know how he ever
could have borne it or have done it.</p>

<p>They sat there about him where
they had often sat before, those fifteen
country gentlemen, some of
whom had been his father’s and
his uncle’s friends, and some his
own schoolmates and companions.
And he stood up, and first he looked
them calm and fearless full in
their faces, and then his voice faltered
and stopped, and then they
all felt that it was indeed something
beyond ordinary that was
coming.</p>

<p>Don’t ask me to tell my master’s
shame as he told it, without a gloss
or an excuse, plain and bald and to
the point. I knew and they knew
that there was excuse for his loving
and lavish nature, but he made
none for himself.</p>

<p>Well, there’s no hiding what all
the world knows now. He had let
himself be led away into speculation
and&mdash;God pity and forgive
him!&mdash;into fraud, till only ruin or
added and greater sin stared him
in the face; then, brought face to
face with that alternative, he had
chosen&mdash;just ruin, sir.</p>

<p>There was dead silence for a
space, till Sir Jasper Meredith,
the oldest man there, and the justest
business man I ever met, said
gravely: “Do you realize, Mr.
Brent, that this implies ruin to
others than to you?”</p>

<p>He was not thinking of himself,
though this trouble would straiten
him sorely; he was thinking, and
so was my master, and so was I, of
poor men, and lone women, and
children and babies, made penniless
at a blow; of the works stopped;
of hunger and sickness and
cold. Mr. James bowed his head;
he could not speak.</p>

<p>Then I had to bring out the
books, and we went carefully over
them page by page. It was like
the Day of Judgment itself to turn
over those accounts, and to read
letters that had to be read, and to
find out, step by step, and in the
very presence of the man we had
honored and trusted, that he had
really fallen from his high place.
He quivered under it, body and
soul, but answered steadily every
question Sir Jasper put to him;
spoke in such a way that I was
sure he as well as I thought of the
last great day, and was answering
to One mightier than man. And
presently, when they had reached
the root of it&mdash;well, Mr. Clarkson,
it was sin and it was shame, and I
dare not call it less before God;
yet it was sin which many another
man does unblushingly, and had
he persisted in it&mdash;had he only the
night previous sent that message,
“Go on”&mdash;it was possible and probable
that he could have saved himself.
Yet, if I could have had my
choice then or now, I would rather
have seen him stand there, disgraced
and ruined by his own act and
will, than have had him live for another
day a hypocrite.</p>

<p>But Sir Jasper said never a word
of praise or blame till the whole
investigation was ended; listened
silently while Mr. James told his
plan to sell all he owned in Brentwood,
pay what debts he could,
and then begin life over again
abroad, and work hard and steadily
to retrieve his fortunes, that he
might pay all and stand with a clear
conscience before he died. Then
Sir Jasper rose and came to him,
put his two hands on Mr. James’
shoulders, and looked him straight
in the eyes. “James Brent,” he
said, “I knew your father before
you, and your father’s father, but I
never honored them more, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_805" id="Page_805">[805]</a></span>
never honored you more, than on
this day when you confess to having
disgraced your name and theirs,
but have had the honesty and manliness
to confess it. Disgrace is
disgrace; but confession is the beginning
of amendment.”</p>

<p>That was all. There was no
offer of money help; all Sir Jasper
could offer would have been but a
drop in the ocean of such utter
ruin. There was no advice to
spare himself before he spared his
neighbor; Sir Jasper was too just
for that. But after those words I
saw my master’s eyes grow moist
and bright, and a gleam of hope
come into his face. My poor master!
my poor master! Thank God
we cannot see the whole of suffering
at the beginning!</p>

<p>The intention was not to let the
news get abroad that night. Mr.
James went home to tell his wife
and children&mdash;how terrible that
seemed to me!&mdash;and I sat busy in
the office. It was the spring of
the year. Fifteen years ago the
coming month he had brought his
bride home in the sunshine and the
flowers. This afternoon darkened
into clouds, and rain came and the
east wind. I lighted the lamps early
and went to my work again. Presently
I heard a sound such as I
never heard before&mdash;a low growl, or
roar, or shout, that wasn’t thunder
or wind or rain. It grew louder;
it was like the tramp of many feet,
hurrying fast, and in the direction
of the bank. Then cries&mdash;a name,
short, distinct, repeated again and
again: “Brent! Brent! James
Brent!”</p>

<p>I went to the window. There
they were, half Brentwood and
more, clamoring for the sight of the
man they trusted above all men. I
flung the window up and they saw
me.</p>

<p>“Halloo, there, Joseph Serle!”
cried the leader, a choleric Scot
who had not been many years
among us. “Where’s our master?”</p>

<p>“Not here,” says I, with a sinking
at my heart.</p>

<p>“He knows,” piped a woman’s
shrill voice; “make him tell us
true.”</p>

<p>And then the Scot cries again:
“Halloo, Joseph Serle, there! Speak
us true, mon, or ye’ll hang for’t.
Is our money safe?”</p>

<p>What could I say? Face after
face I saw by the glare of torches&mdash;faces
of neighbors and friends and
kin&mdash;and not one but was a loser,
and few that were not well-nigh
ruined. And while I hesitated how
to speak again that woman spoke:
“Where’s James Brent? Has he
run, the coward?”</p>

<p>That was too much. “He’s
home,” cried I, “where you and
all decent folk should be.”</p>

<p>“Home! home!” They caught
the word and shouted it. “We’ll
go home too. We’ll find James
Brent.” And the tide turned towards
the Hall.</p>

<p>I flew down the back-stairs to the
stable, mounted the fleetest horse,
and galloped him bareback to Brent
Hall; but, fast as I rode, the east
wind bore an angry shout behind
me, and, if I turned my head, I saw
torches flaring, and the ground
seemed to tremble with the hurrying
tramp of feet.</p>

<p>I don’t know how they bore it
or how I told ’em. I know I found
them together, him and her, and
she was as if she had not shed a
tear, and her eyes were glowing like
stars, bright, and tender, and sad, and
glad all at once. I had hardly time
to tell the news, when the sound
I had dreaded for ’em broke upon
us like the rush and the roar of an
awful storm. On they came, trampling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_806" id="Page_806">[806]</a></span>
over the garden-beds, waving
their torchlights, calling one
name hoarse and constant&mdash;“Brent!
Brent! James Brent!”</p>

<p>“My love,” he said, bending
down to her, “stay while I go to
them.”</p>

<p>And then she looked at him with
a look that was more heavenly than
any smile, and said only: “James,
my place is by your side, and I will
keep it.”</p>

<p>He put his hand quick over his
eyes like one in great awe, smiled
with a smile more sad than tears,
then opened the hall door and
stood out before the crowd&mdash;there
where many a man and woman of
them had seen him bring his young
bride home. And the sudden silence
which fell upon them his own
voice broke. “My friends,” he
said, “what would you have of
me?”</p>

<p>Straight and keen as a barbed
arrow, not from one voice, but from
many, the question rose, “Is our
money safe?” And after that some
one called: “We’ll trust your word,
master, ’gainst all odds.”</p>

<p>I had thought that scene in the
bank was like the Judgment Day;
but what was this? He tried to
speak, but his lips clave together.
Then I saw her draw a little nearer&mdash;not
to touch him or to speak to
him; she did not even look at him,
neither at the people, but out into
the darkness, and up and far away;
and her very body, it seemed to
me, was praying.</p>

<p>“Is our money safe?” It was
like a yell now, and James Brent
made answer: “My friends, I am a
ruined man.”</p>

<p>“Is our money safe?” Little
children’s voices joined in the cry.
My God, let Brentwood never hear
the like again!</p>

<p>My master held out his hands
like any beggar; then he fell down
upon his knees. “I confess to you
and to God,” he said, “there is
not one penny left.”</p>

<p>Mr. Clarkson, I am Brentwood
born and bred. I love my master,
but I love my place and people
too. We are a simple folk and a
loving folk. It is an awful thing to
shake the trust of such. They had
deemed their honor and their property
for ever safe with this one man,
and in an hour and at a word their
trust was broken, their scanty all
was gone, their earthly hopes were
shattered. Mr. Clarkson, sir, it
drove them wild.</p>

<p>That day had set on Brent Hall
fair and stately; the morrow dawned
on blackened ruins. The
grounds lay waste; the fountains
were dry; pictures which nobles
had envied had fed the flames;
fabrics which would have graced a
queen stopped the babbling of the
brooks; and in front of Brent
Bank hung effigies of the last Brent
Brothers, with a halter about the
neck of each.</p>

<p>He had planned&mdash;my master,
my poor master!&mdash;to retrieve all.
Why could it not be? God knows
best, but it is a mystery which I
cannot fathom. That night’s horror
and exposure brought him to
the very gates of death; and when
he rose up at last, it was as a mere
wreck of himself, never to work
again. His wife’s dowry went to
the people whom he had ruined
and who had ruined him. They
lived until her death, as he lives
still, on charity.</p>

<p>And that is all? No, Mr. Clarkson,
not quite all. He was brave
enough, since he could not win
back his honor otherwise, to stay
among us and gain a place again
in the hearts he had wounded sore.
Sometimes I think he teaches us a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_807" id="Page_807">[807]</a></span>
better lesson, old, and alone, and
poor, than if he had come to build
his fallen home once more. I
think, sir, we have learned to pity
and forgive as we never should
have done otherwise, since we have
seen him suffering like any one of
us; as low down as any one of us.</p>

<h4>JAMES BRENT’S VERSION.</h4>

<p>He has told you the story, then,
my boy, has he? And you are
the last of us, and you have my
name&mdash;James Brent Clarkson.
The last? Then I will tell you
more than he could tell you. Do
not shrink or fancy it will pain me.
I would like to let you know all,
my boy&mdash;not for my sake; but you
say you are only half a Catholic,
and I would have you learn something
of the deep reality of the true
faith.</p>

<p>The night I waited for the half-past
eleven train I had been stopped
on my way to the bank by a
crowd at the church door, and
I heard one man say to another:
“They’re dark times, neighbor&mdash;as
dark as our land’s seen these hundred
years.” And his mate answered
him: “Maybe so, Collins;
maybe so. But Brentwood don’t
feel ’em much. I believe, and so
does most folks, that if all other
houses fell, and e’en the Bank of
England broke, Brent Brothers
would stand. It’s been honest and
true for four generations back, and
so ’twull be to the end on’t.” Then
the crowd parted, the men went
into the church, and I passed down
the street.</p>

<p>“Honest and true for four generations
back, and so ’twull be to the
end on’t.” The words haunted me.
At last, in desperation, to rid myself
of the thought, I went to church
also. Going in by a side door, I
found myself in a corner by a confessional,
quite sheltered from view,
but with the pulpit in plain sight.
There, raised high above the heads
of the people, the preacher stood,
a man of middle age, who looked
as if he had been at some time of
his life in and of the world; his
face that of one who has found it
almost a death-struggle to subdue
self to the obedience and the folly of
the cross. He seemed meant for
a ruler among his fellows. I wondered
idly what he was doing there
in the preacher’s frock, speaking
to the crowd.</p>

<p>He was telling, simply and plainly,
of our Lord’s agony in the garden.
But simple and plain as
were his words, there was something
in the face and voice which
drew one into sympathetic union
with this man, who spoke as if he
were literally beholding the load
of our sin lying upon the Lord’s
heart till his sweat of blood started.
And when he had painted
the scene to us, he paused as hearing
the awful cry echo through the
stillness that reigned in the crowded
church, then bent forward as if his
eyes would scan our very hearts,
and spoke once more.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you what he said,
but before he ended I knew this:
my sin cost our Lord’s agony;
added sin of mine would be added
anguish of his. The choice lay before
me. When I showed Serle
those two despatches, the one
“Stop,” the other “Go on,” I held
there what would be my ruin for
time or for eternity.</p>

<p>There is a world unseen, and
mighty; its powers were round me
that night like an army. Hitherto
I had been deceiving myself with
the plea of necessity of others’ interests
to be considered, of my honor
to be sustained. That night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_808" id="Page_808">[808]</a></span>
another motive rose before me, but
it was of an honor put to dishonor&mdash;the
Lord of glory bowed down to
the earth by shame.</p>

<p>The letter must be answered before
morning, so pressing was my
need. I decided to go to the telegraph
office, and by the time I
reached it my mind must be made
up. But, in the street, I came face
to face with the preacher I had
heard that night. The moon was
near the full. We two looked
straight at each other, passed, then
turned as by one impulse, and
faced again. They who fight a
fight to its end, and conquer, but
only with wounds whose scars they
must bear to their graves, sometimes
gain a great power of reading
the souls of those who are fighting
a like contest, and know not yet if
it will end in victory or defeat.
Some fight like mine I felt sure that
priest had fought. “What would
you have, my brother?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Answers to two questions, father,”
I replied. “If a man has
done wrong to others, and can only
repair it by added wrong, shall he
disgrace his own good name for
ever by avowal, or shall he sin?
And if his fall involves the suffering
of his innocent wife and children,
may he not save himself from shame
for their sake? It is a matter
which may not wait now for confession
even. Answer as best you may,
for the love of God.”</p>

<p>I fancied that the stern face before
me softened and grew pale, and
in the momentary stillness I understood
that the Dominican was
praying. Then he answered, few
words and firm, as one who <em>knew</em>:</p>

<p>“To choose disgrace is to choose
the path our divine Lord chose.
To involve our dearest in suffering
is to know his anguish whose blessed
Mother stood beneath his cross.”</p>

<p>Then, after one more slight, intense
silence, “My brother,” he
said earnestly, “I do not know
your life, but I know my own. To
drink the Lord’s cup of shame to
its dregs&mdash;<em>with him</em>&mdash;is a blessed
thing to do, if he gives a sinner
grace to do it.”</p>

<p>Tell me a thousand times that
you have no faith yourself; that to
love God passionately is a dream, a
delusion, unworthy of our manly
nature; that to choose shame is
folly, to choose suffering is a mad
mistake&mdash;what shame could atone
for my sins or give back to the
poor the means of which my folly
had robbed them? What can your
words count with those who have
once tasted the bitter sweetness of
the Lord’s own chalice? Suddenly,
standing there, I knew what it
means to love God more than
houses or lands, wife or children;
to have him more real to the soul
than they to the heart; to be willing
and glad to forsake all for
him; to know I had one more
chance left to do his will, not
Satan’s; and to make my choice.
Having brought his agony on him,
there was nothing more I <em>could</em> do
but bear it with him.</p>

<p>My boy, though you came on my
invitation, you chose the twilight in
which to come to me, that I might
hide my shame at meeting you.
Such shame <em>died dead</em> in two awful
nights and days: First, confession
before the priest of God; then to
colleagues and friends; then to my
wife and to my son&mdash;oh! that
stings yet; then to an angry throng,
whose trust I had betrayed, whose
hopes I had blasted, whose love
and reverence I had turned to
hate and scorn. I have seen my
home in ruins, my effigy hung up
and hooted at in the public square,
my name become a byword, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_809" id="Page_809">[809]</a></span>
race blotted out. I am an old man
now, and still they tell my story in
Brentwood; each child learns it;
strangers hear of it. Yet, if the
power were mine to alter these
twenty years of humiliation, I
would not lose one hour of suffering
or shame.</p>

<p>You ask me why? Thirty-five
years ago I stood here, the centre
and the favorite of this town, and
I set myself to work my own will,
to gain glory for me and mine.
My wife, my name, my home, were
my idols. It seemed an innocent
ambition, but it was not for God,
and it led me into evil work. You
told me that since you came of age
you have been but once to confession.
It is by the light of that
sacrament that what seems to you
the mystery of my life is read.
For a Catholic&mdash;whether striving
after perfection, or struggling up
from sin to lasting penitence&mdash;has
for pattern the life of Jesus, the
doing all in union with him, after
his example. What is the sacrament
of penance but the bearing
of shame, though in the presence
of a compassionate priest, with
him who, when he could have
rescued us at the price of one drop
of his most precious blood, chose
to die in ignominy, bearing before
the world the entire world’s disgrace?
My boy, if in any way,
by the love of our common name,
I can influence you, <em>go back to confession</em>.
It is the very sacrament
for men who would be upright, and
loyal, and strong, and true; or
who, having fallen, would humbly
and bravely bear for Christ’s sake
the disclosure and the penalty.</p>

<p>My penance&mdash;given by God, mark
you&mdash;was heavy, men think. Was
it heavier than my sin? They do
not know everything. All my life
I had been helped, guarded, upheld;
and for such to fall is a deadlier
sin than for others. The infinite
love of God bore with me and
saved me. And as, day by day,
like the unremitted lashes of a
scourge, suffering fell to my portion,
I tell you that a strange, an
awful sweetness mingled with the
anguish. I knew it was the hand
of God that smote me, and that
he smote here to spare hereafter.</p>

<p>Oh! do not look at me. Stop!
Turn your face away! I thought
all such shame was dead, but there
are moments when it overwhelms
me with its sting. Did I say or
dare to think that <em>God loves me</em>?
Wait, wait, till I can remember what
it means!</p>

<p>Yes, I know now. Through all
that night, while the torches glared,
and wrathful faces looked curses at
me, and lips shouted them, ever
through all I saw, as it were, One
sinless but reputed with the wicked;
stripped of his garments as I of my
pride; made a spectacle to angels
and to men; mocked, reviled,
scourged, crucified; and through
the wild tumult I heard a voice
say, as of old to the repentant thief
on the cross: “This day thou shalt
be with me.” And through all my
heart was answering to his most
Sacred Heart, “I, indeed, justly;
for I receive the due reward of my
deeds: but this man hath done no
evil.” How could I wish to be
spared a single pang or lose one
hour of shame with him? What
part could any Christian take but
to suffer with him, having made
him suffer? And when one has
said “with him,” one has explained
all. But, somehow, people do not
always seem to understand.</p>

<p class="break">Understand? Ah! no. It is a
story, not of two versions, but of
many. Some called James Brent a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_810" id="Page_810">[810]</a></span>
fool, and some a madman, and some
said he should have saved his honor
and his name at all hazards; and
some, that he had no right to entail
such suffering on his household.
But there is one light by which such
stories should be read, that is truer
than these. When time is gone,
and wealth is dust, and earthly honor
vanishes like smoke, then, by
the standard of the cross of Christ,
wealth, and pomp, and pleasure,
and business shall be duly tried.
Shun humiliation here as we will,
there shall be after this the judgment,
when the Prince of Glory,
who pronounces final sentence, will
be he who, while on earth, chose for
his portion a life of suffering and a
death of shame.</p>

<h3>ANTI-CATHOLIC MOVEMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES.</h3>

<p>Like commercial panics, periodical
outbursts of irreligious fanaticism
seem to have become regular
incidents in the history of the United
States&mdash;occurrences to be looked
for with as much certainty as if
they were the natural outgrowth of
our civilization and the peculiarly-constituted
condition of American
society. Though springing from
widely different causes, these intermittent
spasms have a marked resemblance
in their deleterious effects
on our individual welfare and national
reputation. Both are demoralizing
and degrading in their
tendencies, and each, in its degree,
finally results in the temporary gain
of a few to the lasting injury and
debasement of the multitude. In
other respects they differ materially.
Great mercantile reverses and isolated
acts of peculation, unfortunately,
are not limited to one community
or to the growth of any particular
system of polity, but are as
common and as frequent in despotic
Asia and monarchical Europe
as in republican America. Popular
ebullitions of bigotry, on the contrary,
are, or, more correctly, ought
to be, confined to those countries
where ignorance and intolerance
usurp the place of enlightened philanthropy
and wise government.
They are foreign to the spirit of
American institutions, hostile to the
best interests of society, and a curse
to those who tolerate or encourage
them. The brightest glory of the
fathers of the republic springs, not
so much from the fact that they separated
the colonies from the mother
country and founded a new nation&mdash;for
that is nothing strange or unheard-of
in the world’s history&mdash;but
that they made its three millions of
inhabitants free as well as independent:
free not only from unjust taxation
and arbitrary laws, but for
ever free to worship their Creator according
to the dictates of their conscience,
unawed by petty authority
and unaffected by the shifting counsels
of subsequent legislators.</p>

<p>From this point of view the Revolution
appears as one of the grandest
moral events in the records of
human progress; and when we reflect
on the numerous pains, penalties,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_811" id="Page_811">[811]</a></span>
and restrictions prescribed by
the charters and by-laws of the colonies
from whence our Union has
sprung, it challenges our most profound
admiration and gratitude.
This complete religious equality,
guaranteed by our fundamental law,
has ever been the boast of every
true American citizen, at home and
abroad. From the halls of Congress
to the far Western stump-meeting
we hear it again and again enunciated;
it is repeated by a thousand
eloquent tongues on each recurring
anniversary of our independence,
and is daily and weekly trumpeted
throughout the length and breadth
of the land by the myriad-winged
Mercuries of the press. This freedom
of worship, freedom of conscience,
and legal equality, as declared
and confirmed by our forefathers,
has become, in fact, not
only the written but also the common
law of the land&mdash;the birthright
of every native-born American, the
acquired, but no less sacred, privilege
of every citizen by adoption.
Whoever now attempts to disturb
or question it, by word or act, disgraces
his country in the eyes of all
mankind, and defiles the memory
of our greatest and truest heroes
and statesmen.</p>

<p>So powerful, indeed, were the example
and teachings of those wise
men who laid broad and deep the
foundations of our happy country
that, during the first half-century
of our national existence, scarcely a
voice was raised in opposition or
protest against the principle of religious
liberty as emphatically expressed
in the first amendment to
the Constitution. A whole generation
had to pass away ere fanaticism
dared to raise its crest, until
the solemn guarantees of our federal
compact were assailed by incendiary
mobs and scouted by so-called
courts of justice. The first flagrant
instance of this fell spirit of
bigotry happened in Massachusetts,
and naturally was directed against
an institution of Catholic learning.</p>

<p>In 1820 four Ursuline nuns arrived
in Boston and established
there a house of their order. Six
years later they removed to the
neighboring village of Charlestown,
where they purchased a piece of
ground, and, calling it Mt. St. Benedict,
erected a suitable building and
reduced the hitherto barren hill-side
to a state of beautiful cultivation.
In 1834 the community had increased
to ten, all ladies of thorough
education and refinement. From
the very beginning their success
as teachers was acknowledged and
applauded, and their average attendance
of pupils was computed at
from fifty to sixty. Of these, at
least four-fifths were Protestants,
the daughters of the best American
families, not only of New England,
but of the Middle and Southern
States. Though it was well known
that the nuns had ever been most
scrupulously careful not to meddle
with the religious opinions of their
scholars, and that not one conversion
to the church could be ascribed
to their influence, the fact that a
school conducted by Catholic religious
should have acquired so brilliant
a reputation, and that its patrons
were principally Protestants
of high social and political standing,
was considered sufficient in the
eyes of the Puritan fanatics to condemn
it.</p>

<p>Its destruction was therefore resolved
on, and an incident, unimportant
in itself, occurred in the
summer of 1834 which was eagerly
seized upon by the clerical adventurers
who then, as now, disgraced
so many sectarian pulpits. It appears
that an inmate of the convent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_812" id="Page_812">[812]</a></span>
a Miss Harrison, had, from excessive
application to music, become partially
demented, and during one of
her moments of hallucination left
the house and sought refuge with
some friends. Her brother, a Protestant,
having heard of her flight,
accompanied by Bishop Fenwick,
brought her back to the nunnery,
to her own great satisfaction and
the delight of the sisterhood. This
trifling domestic affair was eagerly
taken up by the leaders of the anti-Catholic
faction and magnified into
monstrous proportions. The nuns,
it was said, had not only driven an
American lady to madness, but had
immured her in a dungeon, and,
upon her attempting to escape, had,
with the connivance of the bishop
and priests, actually tortured her to
death. Falsehoods even more diabolical
were invented and circulated
throughout Boston. The following
Sunday the Methodist and
Congregational churches rang again
with denunciations against Popery
and nunneries, while one self-styled
divine, a Dr. Beecher, the father of
a numerous progeny of male and
female evangelists, some of whom
have since become famous in more
senses than one, preached no less
than three sermons in as many different
churches on the abominations
of Rome. All the bigotry of Boston
and the adjacent towns was aroused
to the highest pitch of frenzy, and
threats against the convent were
heard on every side.</p>

<p>To pacify the public mind the
selectmen of Charlestown, on the
following day, the memorable 11th
of August, appointed a committee
to examine into the truth of the
charges. They waited on the nuns,
and were received by Miss Harrison,
who was alleged to have been
foully murdered. Under her personal
guidance they searched every
part of the convent and its appurtenances,
till, becoming thoroughly
satisfied with the falsity of the reports,
they retired to draw up a
statement to that effect for publication
in the newspapers. This was
what the rabble dreaded, and, as
soon as the intention of the committee
became known, the leaders
resolved to forestall public sentiment
by acting at once.</p>

<p>Accordingly, about nine o’clock
in the evening, a mob began to
collect in the neighborhood of Mt.
St. Benedict. Bonfires were lit
and exciting harangues were made,
but still there were many persons
reluctant to believe that the rioters
were in earnest. They would not
admit that any great number of
Americans could be found base
and brutal enough to attack a
house filled with defenceless and
delicate women and children. They
were mistaken, however; they had
yet to learn to what lengths fanaticism
can be carried when once the
evil passions of corrupt human
nature are aroused. Towards midnight
a general alarm was rung,
calling out the engine companies
of Boston, not to quell any fire or
disturbance, but, as was proved
by their conduct, to reinforce the
rioters, if necessary. The first demonstration
was made by firing
shot and stones against the windows
and doors of the main building,
to ascertain if there were any
defenders inside; but, upon becoming
satisfied that there were none,
the cowardly mob burst open the
gates and doors, and rushed wildly
through the passages and rooms,
swearing vengeance against the
nuns.</p>

<p>Trusting to the protection of the
authorities, the gentle sisters were
taken by surprise. The shots of
their assailants, however, awakened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_813" id="Page_813">[813]</a></span>
them to a sense of danger. Hastening
from their beds, they rushed
to the dormitories, aroused the
sleeping children, and had barely
time to avoid the fury of the mob
by escaping through a back entrance
in their night-clothes. Everything
portable, including money and
jewelry belonging to the pupils,
was laid hold of by the intruders,
the furniture and valuable
musical instruments were hacked
in pieces, and then the convent
was given to the flames amid the
frantic cheers of assembled thousands.
“Not content with all this,”
says the report of Mr. Loring’s
committee, “they burst open the
tomb of the establishment, rifled it
of the sacred vessels there deposited,
wrested the plates from the
coffins, and exposed to view the
mouldering remains of their tenants.
Nor is it the least humiliating
feature, in this scene of cowardly
and audacious violation of all that
man ought to hold sacred, that it
was perpetrated in the presence of
men vested with authority and of
multitudes of our fellow-citizens,
while not one arm was lifted in the
defence of helpless women and
children, or in vindication of the
violated laws of God and man.
The spirit of violence, sacrilege,
and plunder reigned triumphant.”</p>

<p>The morning of the 12th of August
saw what for years had been the
quiet retreat of Christian learning
and feminine holiness a mass of
blackened ruins; but the character
of Massachusetts had received even
a darker stain, a foul blot not yet
wiped from her escutcheon. It was
felt by the most respectable portion
of the citizens that some step
should be taken to vindicate the
reputation of the State, and to place
the odium of the outrage on those
who alone were guilty. Accordingly,
a committee of thirty-eight
leading Protestant gentlemen, with
Charles G. Loring as chairman,
was appointed to investigate and
report on the origin and results of
the disgraceful proceeding. It met
in Faneuil Hall from day to day,
examined a great number of witnesses,
and made the most minute
inquiries from all sources. Its
final report was long, eloquent, and
convincing. After the most thorough
examination, it was found,
those Protestant gentlemen said,
that all the wild and malicious assertions
put forth in the sectarian
pulpits and repeated in the newspapers,
regarding the Ursulines,
were without a shadow of truth or
probability; they eulogized in the
most glowing language the conduct
of the nuns, their qualifications as
teachers, their Christian piety and
meekness, and their careful regard
for the morals as well as for the
religious scruples of their pupils.
They also attributed the wanton
attack upon the nunnery to the fell
spirit of bigotry evoked by the false
reports of the New England press
and the unmitigated slanders of the
anti-Catholic preachers, and called
upon the legislative authorities to
indemnify, in the most ample manner,
the victims of mob law and
official connivance.</p>

<p>But the most significant fact
brought to light by this committee
was that the fanatics, in their attack
on Mt. St. Benedict, were not a
mere heterogeneous crowd of ignorant
men acting upon momentary
impulse, but a regular band of lawless
miscreants directed and aided
by persons of influence and standing
in society. “There is no
doubt,” says the report, “that a
conspiracy had been formed, extending
into many of the neighboring
towns; but the committee are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_814" id="Page_814">[814]</a></span>
of opinion that it embraced very
few of respectable character in
society, though some such may,
perhaps, be actually guilty of an offence
no less heinous, morally considered,
in having excited the feelings
which led to the design, or
countenanced and instigated those
engaged in its execution.” Here
we find laid down, on the most
unquestionable authority, the origin
and birth-place of all subsequent
Native American movements
against Catholicity.</p>

<p>But the sequel to the destruction
of the Charlestown convent was
even more shameful than the crime
itself. Thirteen men had been arrested,
eight of whom were charged
with arson. The first tried was
the ringleader, an ex-convict, named
Buzzell. The scenes which
were enacted on that occasion are
without a parallel in the annals of
our jurisprudence. The mother-superior,
several of the sisters, and
Bishop Fenwick, necessary witnesses
for the prosecution, were received
in court with half-suppressed
jibes and sneers, subjected to every
species of insult by the lawyers for
the defence, and were frowned upon
even by the judge who presided.
Though the evidence against the
prisoner was conclusive, the jury,
without shame or hesitation, acquitted
him, and he walked out of
court amid the wildest cheers of the
bystanders. Similar demonstrations
of popular sympathy attended the
trials of the other rioters, who were
all, with the exception of a young
boy, permitted to escape the penalty
of their gross crimes.</p>

<p>Even the State legislature, though
urged to do so by many of the leading
public men of the commonwealth,
refused to vote anything
like an adequate sum to indemnify
the nuns and pupils for their losses,
amounting to over a hundred thousand
dollars. The pitiful sum of
ten thousand dollars was offered,
and of course rejected; and to this
day the ruins of the convent stand
as an eloquent monument of Protestant
perfidy and puritanical meanness
and injustice.</p>

<p>The impunity thus legally and
officially guaranteed to mobs and
sacrilegious plunderers soon bore
fruit in other acts of lawlessness
in various parts of Massachusetts.
A Catholic graveyard in Lowell
was shortly after entered and desecrated
by an armed rabble, and a
house in Wareham, in which Mass
was being celebrated, was set upon
by a gang of ruffians known as the
“Convent Boys.” A couple of
years later the Montgomery Guards,
a regular militia company, composed
principally of Catholic freeholders
of Boston, were openly insulted
by their comrades on parade,
and actually stoned through the
streets by a mob of over three thousand
persons.</p>

<p>As there were no more convents
to be plundered and burned in the
stronghold of Puritanism, the war
on those glories of religion was
kept up in a different manner, but
with no less rancor and audacity.
Taking advantage of the excitement
created by such men as Lyman
Beecher and Buzzell, a mercenary
publisher issued a book entitled
<cite>Six Months in a Convent</cite>, which
was put together by some contemptible
preacher in the name of an illiterate
girl named Reed, who, the
better to mislead the public, assumed
the title of “Sister Mary Agnes.”
“We earnestly hope and believe,”
said the preface to this embodiment
of falsehood, “that this little work,
if universally diffused, will do more,
by its unaffected simplicity, in deterring
Protestant parents from educating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_815" id="Page_815">[815]</a></span>
their daughters in Catholic
nunneries than could the most
labored and learned discourses on
the dangers of Popery.” Though
the book was replete with stupid
fabrications and silly blunders, so
grossly had the popular taste been
perverted that fifty thousand copies
were sold within a year after its
publication. The demand was still
increasing, when another contribution
to Protestant literature appeared,
before the broad, disgusting, and
obscene fabrications of which the
mendacity of “Sister Mary Agnes”
paled its ineffectual fires. This
latter candidate for popular favor,
though it bore the name, destined
for an immortality of infamy, of
Maria Monk&mdash;a notoriously dissolute
woman&mdash;was actually compiled
by a few needy and unscrupulous
adventurers, reverend and irreverend,
who found a distinguished
Methodist publishing house, not
quite so needy, though still more
unscrupulous, to publish the work
for them, though very shame compelled
even them to withhold their
names from the publication. And
it was only owing to a legal suit
arising from this infamous transaction
many years after that the
fact was revealed that the publishers
of this vilest of assaults on one
of the holiest institutions of the
Catholic Church was the firm of
Harper Brothers. True to their
character, they saw that the times
were favorable for an assault on
Catholicity, even so vile as this
one; and true to their nature again,
they refused to their wretched accomplice
her adequate share in the
wages of sin. Though bearing on
its face all the evidences of diabolical
malice and falsehood, condemned
by the better portion of the
press and by all reputable Protestants,
the work had an unparalleled
sale for some time. The demand
might have continued to go on increasing
indefinitely, but, in an evil
hour for the speculators, its authors,
under the impression that the prurient
taste of the public was not
sufficiently satiated with imaginary
horrors, issued a continuation under
the title of <cite>Additional Awful
Disclosures</cite>. This composition proved
an efficient antidote to the malignant
poison of the first. Its impurity
and falsehoods were so palpable
that its originators were glad to
slink into obscurity and their patrons
into silence, followed by the
contempt of all honest men.</p>

<p>Just ten years after the Charlestown
outrage the spirit of Protestant
persecution began to revive.
Premonitory symptoms of political
proscription appeared in 1842, in
the constitutional conventions of
Rhode Island and Louisiana, and
in the local legislatures of other
States; but it was not till the early
part of 1844 that it became evident
that secret measures were being
taken to arouse the dormant feeling
of antipathy to the rights of
Catholics, so rife in the hearts of
the ignorant Protestant masses.
New York, at first, was the principal
seat of the disorder. Most
of the newspapers of that period
teemed with eulogistic reviews of
books written against the faith;
cheap periodicals, such as the Rev.
Mr. Sparry’s <cite>American Anti-Papist</cite>,
were thrust into the hands of
all who would read them by the
agents of the Bible and proselytizing
societies; and a cohort of
what were called anti-papal lecturers,
of which a reverend individual
named Cheever was the leader,
was employed to attack the Catholic
Church with every conceivable
weapon that the arsenal of Protestantism
afforded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_816" id="Page_816">[816]</a></span></p>

<p>The popular mind being thus
prepared for a change, the various
elements of political and social life
opposed to Catholicity were crystallized
into the “American Republican”
party, better known as the
Native Americans. On the 19th
of March, 1844, the new faction
nominated James Harper for mayor
of the city of New York, and
about the same time William Rockwell
was named for a similar
office in Brooklyn. The platform
upon which these gentlemen
stood was simple but comprehensive:
the retention of the Protestant
Bible and Protestant books in
the public schools; the exclusion
of Catholics of all nationalities
from office; and the amendment
of the naturalization laws so as to
extend the probationary term of
citizenship to twenty-one years.
The canvass in New York was
conducted with some regard to
decency; but in the sister city, the
Nativists threw off all respect for
law, their processions invaded the
districts inhabited mainly by adopted
citizens, assailed all who did not
sympathize with them, and riot and
bloodshed were the consequence.
In Brooklyn the Nativist candidate
was defeated, but Harper was elected
triumphantly by about twenty-four
thousand votes. The ballots
that placed such a man at the head
of the municipality of the American
metropolis were deposited by
both Whigs and Democrats, though
each party had a candidate in the
field. The former contributed upwards
of fourteen thousand, or
three-fourths of their strength; their
opponents somewhat less than ten
thousand.</p>

<p>But the action of the city politicians
was quickly repudiated and
condemned throughout the State.
On the 13th of April the Whigs assembled
in Albany and passed a
series of resolutions denouncing in
unequivocal terms the tenets of
the Native Americans; and in two
days after, at the same place, and
in, if possible, a more forcible manner,
the Democracy entered their
protest against the heresies and evil
tendencies of the persecuting faction.
Still, the “American Republicans”
showed such signs of
popular strength in various municipal
elections that year that the
lower classes of politicians, of all
shades of opinion, who dared not
openly support them, were suspected
of secretly courting their friendship.
The nomination of Frelinghuysen
with Henry Clay at the
Whig presidential convention of
May 1, 1844, was well understood
at the time to be a bid for Nativist
support, and eventually defeated
the distinguished Kentucky orator.</p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine how far
the madness of the hour might
have carried ambitious political
leaders and timid conventions, had
not the scenes of sacrilege and
murder which soon after disgraced
the city of Philadelphia, and stained
its streets with innocent blood,
sent a thrill of horror throughout
the entire country.</p>

<p>Philadelphia had followed, if not
anticipated, the example of New
York in sowing broadcast the seeds
of civil strife. Early in the year
secret Nativist societies were formed;
sensational preachers like Tyng,
in and out of place, harangued
congregations and meetings; cheap
newspapers were started for the
sole purpose of vilifying Catholics
and working upon the baser passions
of the sectarian population
of the country. The motives of
those engineers of discord were the
same as those of their New York
brethren, and their method of attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_817" id="Page_817">[817]</a></span>
equally treacherous and cowardly.
One of the principal charges
against their Catholic fellow-citizens
was that they were hostile to
free schools and education generally.
To this unjust aspersion
Bishop Kenrick, on the 12th of
March, publicly replied in a short
but lucid letter, in which he said:</p>

<p>“Catholics have not asked that
the Bible be excluded from the
public schools. They have merely
desired for their children the
liberty of using the Catholic version,
in case the reading of the Bible
be prescribed by the controllers
or directors of the schools.
They only desire to enjoy the benefit
of the constitution of the
State of Pennsylvania, which guarantees
the rights of conscience and
precludes any preference of sectarian
modes of worship. They ask
that the school laws be faithfully
executed, and that the religious
predilections of the parents be respected.…
They desire that the
public schools be preserved from
all sectarian influence, and that
education be conducted in a way
that may enable all citizens equally
to share its benefits, without any
violence being offered to their conscientious
convictions.”</p>

<p>So deliberate and emphatic a
denial had no effect on the wretched
men who tyrannized over the
second city in the Union, except
that it was resolved to substitute
brute force for reason, and to precipitate
a collision with their comparatively
weak victims. Accordingly,
on the 5th of May, a Nativist
meeting was held in Kensington.
The design of the managers of the
meeting was evidently to provoke
an attack; for, finding the place first
selected for the gathering unmolested,
they deliberately moved to
the market-house, in the actual
presence of several adopted citizens.
This trick and the insulting
speeches that followed had the
desired effect. A riot took place,
several shots were fired on both
sides, and four or five persons were
more or less seriously wounded.
The Nativists retreated, and made
an unsuccessful attempt to burn a
nunnery.</p>

<p>The most exaggerated reports
of this affair were immediately circulated
through Philadelphia. The
next day the Nativists, fully armed,
assembled and passed a series of resolutions
of the most violent character.
Preceded by an American
flag, which bore an inscription as
malicious as it was untrue, they
attacked the Hibernian Hose Company,
destroyed the apparatus, and
broke the fire-bell in pieces. Twenty-nine
dwellings were burned to the
ground, their hapless occupants,
mostly women and children, fleeing
in all directions amid the insults
and shots of their savage assailants.
The citizens were now
thoroughly aroused, the military,
under Gen. Cadwalader, was called
out, and Bishop Kenrick addressed
a public admonition to
his flock to preserve peace, and,
notwithstanding the provocation,
to exercise forbearance. But the
demon of fanaticism, once let loose,
could not be easily laid. Rioting
continued throughout the day and
far into the night. Early on Wednesday
morning S. Michael’s
Church, the female seminary attached
to it, and a number of private
houses in the neighborhood
were ruthlessly plundered and destroyed.
“During the burning of
the church,” said one of the Philadelphia
papers, “the mob continued
to shout; and when the cross at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_818" id="Page_818">[818]</a></span>
the peak of the roof fell, they gave
three cheers and a drum and fife
played the ‘Boyne Water.’”</p>

<p>The burning of S. Augustine’s
Church took place on the evening of
the same day. This building, one
of the finest in the city, was peculiarly
endeared to the Catholic inhabitants
as having been one of
their oldest churches in Philadelphia.
Many of the contributors
to its building fund were men of
historic fame, such as Washington,
Montgomery, Barry, Meade, Carey,
and Girard. It had adjoining it
extensive school-houses and a commodious
parsonage, and the clock
in its tower was the one which had
struck the first tones of new-born
American liberty. But the sacred
character of the building itself, and
the patriotic memories which surrounded
it, could not save it from
the torch of the Philadelphia mob.</p>

<p>“The clock struck ten,” wrote an
eye-witness, “while the fire was
raging with the greatest fury. At
twenty minutes past ten the cross
which surmounted the steeple, and
which remained unhurt, fell with a
loud crash, amid the plaudits of a
large portion of the spectators.”
A very valuable library and several
splendid paintings shared the fate
of the church.</p>

<p>But bad as was the conduct of
the rioters, that of the authorities
was even worse. The militia, when
ordered out, did not muster for several
hours after the time appointed,
and when they did arrive they were
only passive, if not gratified, spectators
of the lawless scenes before
them. When S. Michael’s was
threatened, the pastor, Rev. Mr.
Donohue, placed it under the charge
of Capt. Fairlamb, giving him the
keys; yet the mob was allowed to
wreak its vengeance on it undisturbed.
The basement of S. Augustine’s
was occupied by some armed
men who had resolved to defend
it at all hazards; but on the assurance
of Mayor Scott and the sheriff
that they had troops and police
enough to protect it, it was agreed,
in the interests of peace, to evacuate
it. This had scarcely been done
when the militia and civic guard fell
back before a thousand or more
armed ruffians and left the church
to its fate. For nearly sixty hours
the rioters were left in undisputed
possession of the city; everything
the Catholics held sacred was violated;
men were dragged out of
their homes, half-hanged and brutally
maltreated, when not murdered
outright; the houses of adopted
citizens were everywhere plundered,
an immense amount of property
was destroyed, and over two hundred
families left desolate and
homeless, without the slightest attempt
being made to enforce the
law. How many fell victims to
Nativist hate and rage on this occasion
has never been known, but
the killed and wounded were counted
by scores.</p>

<p>An attempt to outrival Philadelphia
in atrocity was made in New
York a few days after, but the precautionary
steps of the authorities,
the firm attitude assumed by the
late Archbishop Hughes, and the
resolute stand taken by the Catholic
population, headed by Eugene Casserly&mdash;who
was at that time editor
of the <cite>Freeman’s Journal</cite>&mdash;together
with some young Irish-American
Catholic gentlemen, so impressed
the leaders of the Nativists that
all attempts of an incendiary nature,
and all public efforts to sympathize
with the Philadelphia mob, were
abandoned. Nativism staggered
under the blow given it by its adherents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_819" id="Page_819">[819]</a></span>
in Philadelphia, and soon sank
into utter insignificance as a political
power.</p>

<p>Another decade, however, passed,
and we find it again rejuvenated.
This time it assumed the name of
the Know-nothing party, and extended
its ramifications through
every State in the Union. Its declaration
of principles contained
sixteen clauses, as laid down by its
organs, of which the following were
regarded as the most vital: 1st.
The repeal of all naturalization
laws. 2d. None but native Americans
for office. 3d. A Protestant
common-school system. 4th. Perpetual
war on “Romanism.” 5th.
Opposition to the formation of military
companies composed of “foreigners.”
6th. Stringent laws
against immigration. 7th. Ample
protection to Protestant interests.
Though partly directed, apparently,
against all persons of foreign birth,
this new secret society was actually
only opposed to Catholics; for many
of the prominent members in its
lodges were Irish Orangemen and
Welsh, Scotch, and English unnaturalized
adventurers who professed
no form of belief.</p>

<p>Like their predecessors of 1844,
the Know-nothings employed a
host of mendacious ministers and
subsidized a number of obscure
newspapers to circulate their slanders
against Catholics, native as
well as adopted citizens; but they
also added a new feature to the crusade
against morality and civil
rights. This was street-preaching&mdash;a
device for creating riots and
bloodshed, for provoking quarrels
and setting neighbor against neighbor,
worthy the fiend of darkness
himself. Wretched creatures, drawn
from the very dregs of society, were
hired to travel from town to town,
to post themselves at conspicuous
street-corners, if possible before
Catholic churches, and to pour
forth, in ribald and blasphemous
language, the most unheard-of slanders
against the church. As those
outcasts generally attracted a
crowd of idle persons, and were
usually sustained by the presence
of the members of the local lodge,
the merest interruption of their
foul diatribes was the signal for a
riot, ending not unfrequently in
loss of life or limb.</p>

<p>The first outrage that marked the
career of the Know-nothings of
1854 was the attack on the Convent
of Mercy, Providence, R. L.,
in April of that year. Instigated
by the newspaper attacks of a notorious
criminal, who then figured
as a Nativist leader, the rowdy elements
of that usually quiet city
surrounded the convent, pelted the
doors and windows with stones, to
the great alarm of the ladies and
pupils within, and would doubtless
have proceeded to extremities were
it not that the Catholics, fearing
a repetition of the Charlestown affair,
rallied for its protection and
repeatedly drove them off. In
June Brooklyn was the scene of
some street-preaching riots, but in
the following August St. Louis,
founded by Catholics and up to
that time enjoying an enviable reputation
for refinement and love
of order, acquired a pre-eminence
in the Southwest for ferocious bigotry.
For two days, August 7 and
8, riot reigned supreme in that city;
ten persons were shot down in the
streets, many more were seriously
wounded, and a number of the
houses of Catholics were wrecked.</p>

<p>On the 3d of September of the
same year the American Protestant
Association of New York, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_820" id="Page_820">[820]</a></span>
auxiliary of the Know-nothings,
composed of Orangemen, went to
Newark, N. J., to join with similar
lodges of New Jersey in some celebration.
In marching through the
streets of that city they happened
to pass the German Catholic church,
and, being in a sportive mood, they
did not hesitate to attack it. A
<i lang="fr">mêlée</i> occurred, during which one
man, a Catholic, was killed and
several were seriously injured. The
evidence taken by the coroner’s jury
showed that the admirers of King
William were well armed, generally
intoxicated, and that the assault
and partial destruction of the
church were altogether wanton and
unprovoked. Early in the same
month news was received of a succession
of riots in New Orleans,
the victims, as usual, being Catholics.</p>

<p>But the spirit of terrorism was
not confined to one section or
particular State. The virus of bigotry
had inoculated the whole
body politic. In October people
of all shades of religious opinion
were astounded to hear from Maine
that the Rev. John Bapst, S. J., a clergyman
of exemplary piety and mildness,
had actually been dragged
forcibly from the house of a friend
by a drunken Ellsworth mob, ridden
on a rail, stripped naked, tarred
and feathered, and left for
dead. His money and watch were
likewise stolen by the miscreants.
Father Bapst’s crime was that, when
a resident of Ellsworth some time
previously, he had entered into a
controversy about public schools.</p>

<p>Yet, in the face of all these lawless
proceedings, the Know-nothing
party increased with amazing rapidity.
“Without presses, without
electioneering,” said the New York
<cite>Times</cite>, “with no prestige or power,
it has completely overthrown and
swamped the two old historic parties
of the country.” This was
certainly true of New England, and
notably so of Massachusetts, where,
in the autumn of 1854, the Know-nothings
elected their candidate
for governor and nearly every member
of the legislature. In the State
of New York Ullman, the standard-bearer
of the new army of
persecution, received over 122,000
votes, and, though defeated in the
city, it was more than suspected
that the Democrat who was chosen
as mayor had been a member of
the organization. In many other
States and cities the power of the
sworn secret combination was felt
and acknowledged.</p>

<p>Its influence and unseen grasp
on the passions and prejudices of
the lower classes of Protestants
were plainly perceptible in the
halls of Congress and in the executive
cabinet. In the Senate
William H. Seward was the first
and foremost to denounce the so-called
American party. As early
as July, 1854, in a speech on the
Homestead Bill, he took occasion
to remark:</p>

<p>“It is sufficient for me to say
that, in my judgment, everything is
un-American which makes a distinction,
of whatever kind, in this
country between the native-born
American and him whose lot is directed
to be cast here by an over-ruling
Providence, and who renounces
his allegiance to a foreign
land and swears fealty to the country
which adopts him.”</p>

<p>The example of the great statesman
was followed by such men
as Douglas, Cass, Keitt, Chandler,
and Seymour, while Senators Dayton
and Houston, Wilson, the late
Vice-President, N. P. Banks, and
a number of other politicians championed
the cause of intolerance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_821" id="Page_821">[821]</a></span>
as has since been confessed, for
their own selfish aggrandizement
as much as from inherent littleness
of soul.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Massachusetts was
completely controlled by the Know-nothings.
Their governor, Gardiner,
had not been well in the
chair of state when he disbanded all
the Irish military companies within
his jurisdiction. These were
the Columbian, Webster, Shields,
and Sarsfield Guards of Boston,
the Jackson Musketeers of Lowell,
the Union Guard of Lawrence, and
the Jackson Guard of Worcester.
The General Court, too, not to be
outdone in bigotry by the executive,
passed a law for the inspection
of nunneries, convents, and schools,
and appointed a committee to
carry out its provisions. The first&mdash;and
last&mdash;domiciliary visit of this
body was made to the school of the
Sisters of Notre Dame in Roxbury.
It is thus graphically described
by the Boston <cite>Advertiser</cite>, an eminently
Protestant authority: “The
gentlemen&mdash;we presume we must
call members of the legislature by
this name&mdash;roamed over the whole
house from attic to cellar. No
chamber, no passage, no closet,
no cupboard, escaped their vigilant
search. No part of the house was
enough protected by respect for
the common courtesies of civilized
life to be spared in the examination.
The ladies’ dresses hanging
in their wardrobes were tossed
over. The party invaded the chapel,
and showed their respect&mdash;as
Protestants, we presume&mdash;for the
One God whom all Christians worship
by talking loudly with their
hats on; while the ladies shrank in
terror at the desecration of a spot
which they believed hallowed.”</p>

<p>Still, the work of proscription
and outrage went on in other directions.
Fifteen school-teachers
had been dismissed in Philadelphia
because they were Catholics; the
Rev. F. Nachon, of Mobile, was
assaulted and nearly killed while
pursuing his sacred avocations; a
military company in Cincinnati,
and another in Milwaukee, composed
of adopted citizens, were disbanded,
and on the 6th and 7th
of August, 1855, the streets of Louisville
ran red with the blood of
adopted citizens. In this last and
culminating Know-nothing outrage
eleven hundred voters were driven
from the polls, numbers of men,
and even women, were shot down
in the public thoroughfares, houses
were sacked and burned, and at
least five persons are known to have
been literally roasted alive.</p>

<p>A reaction, however, had already
set in. Men of moderate views and
unbiassed judgments began to tire
of the scenes of strife, murder, and
rapine that accompanied the victories
of the Know-nothings. The
first to deal it a deadly blow, as a
political body, was Henry A. Wise,
of Virginia, in his noble canvass
of that State against the combined
Whig and Nativist elements in 1855;
and to the late Archbishop of New
York, in his utter discomfiture of
State Senator Brooks, is justly due
the merit of having first convinced
the American people that the so-called
American party was actually
the most dangerous enemy of
American laws and institutions, the
advocate of spoliation and persecution
under the guise of patriotism
and reform.</p>

<p>The decline of Nativism, though
not so rapid as its growth, was
equally significant, and its history
as instructive. In 1856 a national
convention was called by the wreck
of the party to nominate Fillmore
for the presidency, after overtures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_822" id="Page_822">[822]</a></span>
had been made in vain to the Republicans
and Democrats. Fillmore
was so badly defeated that he retired
into private life and lost whatever
little fame he had acquired in
national affairs as Taylor’s successor.
Four years later Bell and
Everett appeared on the Know-nothing
ticket, but so far behind
were they in the race with their
presidential competitors that very
few persons cared to remember the
paucity of their votes. Gradually,
silently, but steadily, like vermin
from a sinking ship, the leaders
slunk away from the already doomed
faction, and, by a hypocritical
display of zeal, endeavored to obtain
recognition in one or other of
the great parties, but generally without
success. Disappointed ambition,
impotent rage, and, let us
hope, remorse of conscience occasionally
seized upon them, and the
charity of silence became to them
the most desired of blessings. Perhaps
if the late civil war had not
occurred, to swallow in the immensity
of its operations all minor interests,
we might have beheld in
1864 the spectre of Nativism arising
from its uneasy slumber, to be again
subjected to its periodical blights
and curses.</p>

<p>From present appearances many
far-seeing persons apprehend the
recurrence in this year of the wild
exhibitions of anti-Catholic and
anti-American fanaticism which
have so often blotted and blurred
the otherwise stainless pages of our
short history; that the centennial
year of American independence
and republican liberty is to be signalized
by a more concerted, better
organized, and more ramified
attack on the great principles of
civil and religious freedom which
underlie and sustain the fabric
of our government. We trust, sincerely
hope, that these men are
mistaken. But if such is to be
the case; if we Catholics are doomed
once more to be subjected to
the abuse of the vile, the slander
of the hireling, and the violence of
an armed mob, the sooner we are
prepared for the contingency the
better. If the scenes which have
indelibly disgraced Boston and
Philadelphia, Ellsworth and Louisville,
are to be again rehearsed
by the half-dozen sworn secret societies
whose cabalistic letters disfigure
the columns of so many of
our newspapers, we must be prepared
to meet the danger with
firmness and composure. As Catholics,
demanding nothing but what
is justly our due under the laws,
our position will ever be one of
forbearance, charity, and conciliation;
but as American citizens,
proud of our country and zealous
for the maintenance of her institutions,
our place shall be beside the
executors of those grand enactments
which have made this republic
the paragon and exemplar
of all civil and natural virtues,
no matter how imminent the danger
or how great the sacrifice. In
lands less favored Catholic rights
may be violated by prince or mob
with impunity, but we would be
unworthy of our country and of
its founders were we to shrink for
a moment from the performance of
our trust as the custodians of the
fundamental ordinance which guarantees
full and absolute religious liberty
to all citizens of the republic.</p>

<h3>LOUISE LATEAU BEFORE THE BELGIAN ROYAL ACADEMY
OF MEDICINE.<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></h3>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p>How is the name of Louise Lateau
to be mentioned without immediately
calling up all the tumulta
which that name has provoked?
Books of science and philosophy, official
reports, academic discourses,
reports of visits, <i lang="fr">feuilletons</i>, conferences,
pamphlets, articles in journals,
every kind of literary production
has been placed under contribution
to keep the public informed
about the <i lang="fr">stigmatisée</i> of Bois
d’Haine. For a year, however,
these studies have betaken themselves
to a region that might be
called exclusively scientific, and
have even received a kind of official
consecration from the recent
vote of the Royal Academy of
Medicine.</p>

<p>It may be of service to the reader
who cannot occupy himself with
special studies to give a brief exposition
of the affair of Bois d’Haine
in itself, to show the different interpretations
of it that have been
attempted, and to indicate clearly
the actual phase of the question
from a scientific point of view.</p>

<p>As early as about the middle of
1868 vague rumors were heard of
strange events which were taking
place in a little village of Hainault.
Every Friday a young girl
showed on the different portions
of her body corresponding to the
wounds of our Saviour Jesus Christ
red stains from which blood flowed
in greater or less abundance. It
was also said that on every Friday
this young girl, ravished in ecstasy,
remained for several hours completely
unconscious of all that was
passing around her. Such were
the principal facts. Over and above
these rumor spread the story of
certain accessory incidents, some
of which, though true, were distorted,
while others were pure
fancy. Thanks to the daily press,
the young girl soon became known
to the general public, and the
name of Louise Lateau passed from
mouth to mouth. Here and there
one read among “current events”
that large crowds rushed from
all sides, from Belgium and from
without, to assist every Friday
at the scenes which were being
enacted in the chamber at Bois
d’Haine. Some journals profited
by the occasion to deliver themselves
anew of declamations against
“Catholic superstitions, the stupidity
of the masses, and the intriguing
character of the clergy”; while
even many men of good faith were
of opinion that the story told of
Louise Lateau might indeed be
true, but ought to be attributed to
some trickery or another of which
either the girl or her family was
culpable.</p>

<p>Happily for the public, a light
came to clear up this chaos of
versions, suppositions, and diverse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_824" id="Page_824">[824]</a></span>
and contradictory opinions. The
<cite>Revue Catholique</cite> of Louvain reproduced
by instalments, beginning
in 1869, a study by Prof.
Lefebvre on these extraordinary
events. Some time after, this
study appeared in the form of a
volume. Here is how the eminent
physician expresses himself on the
origin of his study:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The story told by the first witnesses of
these extraordinary events produced a
lively emotion in the public mind, and
soon crowds assembled every week
around the humble house which was their
theatre. The ecclesiastical authorities
took up the facts. This was their right
and duty. From the very beginning they
recognized that the different elements of
the question ought to pass through the
crucible of science. The periodic hemorrhage
and the suspension of the exercise
of the senses were within the competence
of physicians. I was asked to
study them, the desire being expressed
that the examination of these facts
should be of the most thorough description,
and that they should not be allowed
to escape any one of the exigencies and
severities of modern science.… I
deemed it right, therefore, to accept the
mission which was offered me. As a physician,
I was only asked for what I could
give&mdash;that is to say, a purely medical
study of the facts.”<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

</div>

<p>After having examined the events
of Bois d’Haine in all their phases;
after having put to the proof the
sincerity of the young girl in a
thousand different ways and by
means of a variety of tests, the
eminent Louvain professor pronounced
the facts of the stigmatization
and ecstasy to be real and
free from deception. Passing,
then, to the interpretation of the
events themselves, the author thus
concludes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Studying first the question of hemorrhage,
I have demonstrated that the periodic
bleedings of Louise Lateau belong
to no species of hemorrhage admitted in
the regular range of science; that they
cannot be assimilated to any of the
extraordinary cases recorded in the annals
of medicine; that, in fine, the laws of
physiology do not afford an explanation
of their genesis. Coming next to the
question of ecstasy, I have carefully
gone over the characters of the standard
nervous affections which could offer certain
traits of a resemblance, however remote,
to the ecstasy of Louise Lateau,
and I believe I have demonstrated that
it is impossible to connect it with any
of the nervous affections known to-day.
I have penetrated the domain of occult
sciences; those dark doctrines have
furnished us with no more data for an
interpretation of the events of Bois
d’Haine than the free sciences which
expand in the full light of day.”</p>

</div>

<p>I do not hesitate to say that the
appearance of this book was a veritable
event, and that it marked an
important halting-place in the study
of the question of Louise Lateau.
By those who knew the calm and
reflective spirit of M. Lefebvre, and
the independence of his character
and convictions, the fact of the
real existence of the extraordinary
events taking place at Bois d’Haine
was no longer called in question;
and if some doubt still remained, it
regarded only the sense in which
those events were to be interpreted.
Was it, then, true that the union of
stigmata and ecstasies belonged to
no known malady? Was it true
that they could find no place in the
classification of diseases, under a
new title, with physiological proofs
to accompany them?</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the immense
credit allowed to the science of M.
Lefebvre, doubt still hovered around
this question, and I make bold to
say, in the honor of the progress of
science, that such doubt was legitimate.
A loyal appeal was made to
the <i lang="fr">savants</i> of the country and of
foreign countries, urging them to go
and study the facts at Bois d’Haine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_825" id="Page_825">[825]</a></span>
and publish their opinion. Soon a
study on Louise Lateau, made by a
French physician,<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> came to confirm
still further the medical study of M.
Lefebvre. Then a German <i lang="fr">savant</i>,
M. Virchow, seemed to accept as
true the conclusions of the Belgian
doctor by that famous phrase that
the events of Bois d’Haine must be
considered either as a trick or as a
miracle.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, certain persons seemed
still reluctant to accept facts
which a hundred different witnesses
affirmed in the face of the world.
Among the reluctant are to be
ranked, first of all, those who are
of bad faith&mdash;with whom there is no
reason to trouble; others who, for
philosophic motives, seemed to
accuse the witnesses of those scenes
of sacrificing the interest of science
to that of their religious convictions.
Nevertheless, M. Lefebvre’s
book continued to make headway.
I do not say that it did not meet
with some attacks here and there,
and certain objections in detail; but
throughout the country no publication
of any pretension to seriousness
affected either to deny the
facts or to give a natural explanation
of them. This state of
things continued up to July, 1874.
At this epoch Dr. Charbonnier,
a physician of Brussels, presented
to the Belgian Royal Academy of
Medicine a work entitled <cite>Maladies
et facultés diverses des mystiques.
Louise Lateau.</cite></p>

<p>M. Boëns, on his part, submitted
to the same learned body, in the
session of October 3, 1874, a new
production, entitled <cite>Louise Lateau,
ou les mystères de Bois d’Haine dévoilés</cite>.</p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p>The events of Bois d’Haine continued
to occupy public attention.
The scenes of the stigmatic flows
of blood and of the ecstasies were
presented every Friday. It was
even stated that from the middle
of 1871 Louise Lateau had taken
no sort of nourishment. The Belgian
Royal Academy of Medicine,
whether because it dreaded to enter
upon a question which involved,
beyond the scientific side, a side
purely philosophic, or whether also
because a fitting and favorable opportunity
of taking up the question
of Louise Lateau was not presented,
remained mute as to the events of
Bois d’Haine.</p>

<p>The almost simultaneous presentation
of two works treating on the
very subject indicated clearly that
the question was ripe. Moreover,
in the session of October 3, 1874,
the chief medical body of the country,
conformably with usage, appointed
a special committee to
make a report on the works read in
its sessions. This committee consisted
of MM. Fossion, president;
Mascart and Warlomont, colleagues.</p>

<p>The important report of the committee
was read in the session of
the 13th of February by M. Warlomont.
That gentleman to show
how the study of M. Charbonnier’s
work necessitated an examination
into the affair at Bois d’Haine,
said:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Ought the committee to confine itself
to examining the memorial placed before
it from the simple point of view of
its absolute scientific value, without occupying
itself with the fact which gives
occasion for the memorial? It would be
easier to do so, perhaps, but an opportunity
would thus be neglected of putting
the Academy in possession of an actual
medical observation, as complete as possible,
relative to a fact of which, whether
we like it or not, the discussion can no
longer be eluded. It assumed, therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_826" id="Page_826">[826]</a></span>
the task of inquiring into the affair forthwith;
resolved, however arduous might
be the mission thus undertaken, to accept
it without regret, to pursue it without
weakness as without bias, and to
set before the society such elements as
its investigation&mdash;one altogether official&mdash;should
have procured. This is the trust
which, in its name, I this day fulfil.”<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

</div>

<p>MM. Charbonnier and Boëns were
the first in our country who undertook
to find fault with the conclusions
of M. Lefebvre’s book, and to
explain by scientific data the events
of Bois d’Haine. M. Boëns, almost
immediately after the reading of a
portion of his work, withdrew it,
and was able by this means to escape
the report of the committee.
Was this disdain for the judgment
of his <i lang="fr">confrères</i> on the part of the
distinguished physician of Charleroi,
or was it want of confidence in
the solidity of his own arguments?
I know not. I state a fact and
continue.</p>

<p>There remained, then, for the
committee to examine the work of
M. Charbonnier. This memoir is
voluminous. The theory of the
author is substantially as follows:
The absence of aliment and the
concentration of the faculties of
the soul towards one object have
been the primary and indispensable
conditions of ecstasies and stigmata.
As far as abstinence is concerned,
it is perfectly compatible, if not
with a state of health, at least with
the maintenance of life. “The
question of abstinence,” says the
author, “is the most important, because
without it nothing happens.
It being well explained, there is no
longer anything supernatural in
any of the physiological and pathological
phenomena of the mystics.”<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>But how is this abstinence compatible
with life? By the law of
the substitution of functions and
organs.</p>

<p>“The organs,” says the author,
“are conjointly associated (<i lang="fr">solidaires</i>)
one with another, working
for the common health; so that
when an organ, for one cause or
another, cannot adequately fulfil its
functions, another immediately supplies
its place.”</p>

<p>Supposing all this admitted, here
is what the author says of stigmatization:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Abstinence and contemplation are
the causes of stigmatization: i. Abstinence,
in suppressing the vegetative
functions, frees both the nervous influx
and the blood which were distributed
among the digestive organs. 2. Contemplation
gathers together the contingent
of pain dispersed through all the
body, to fix and concentrate it on certain
points which it sees, admires, loves, in
Jesus Christ. It suppresses all the functions
of the life of relation to devote itself
exclusively to the object of its passion.
The bloody flux, which has been
drawn to the surface of the skin by the
great functional activity, follows to the
end the nervous influx which is constantly
directed towards certain points, and
the stigmatization is effected.”<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Of the ecstasy, according to M.
Charbonnier, “abstinence is the
principal, contemplation the secondary,
cause.” We cannot, indeed,
enter into all the details furnished
by the author of this strange theory.
In order to arrive at a judgment
regarding it, we know of nothing
better than to cite the conclusions
of the reader of the report on the
work itself:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All this,” says M. Warlomont, “forms
a whole which must have cost the author
long and laborious research. As far as
the inquiries of physiology are concerned,
the source, respectable though it may
be, on which he has relied, must be a
cause for regret. His principal, almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_827" id="Page_827">[827]</a></span>
his only, authority is that of Longet, who
is now many years dead. But the questions
relative to nutrition&mdash;those precisely
which are at stake&mdash;have, since Longet,
been placed in an absolutely new light.
The work which we have just analyzed
is altogether a work of the imagination.
The demonstration of the <i lang="la">à priori</i> thesis
which the author has set up he has pursued
by every means, clearing out of his
road the obstacles of nature which embarrass
it, and creating at will new functions
whereon to apply his organs; all
this written in a lively, imaginative style,
and bearing the impress of conviction.
There is only one thing which is sadly
wanting&mdash;experimental proof. A few
simple experiments on animals, logically
carried out, would have informed him
how they withstand a progressive abstinence,
and what changes this abstinence
effects in their organs and functions. It is
to be regretted that he has not instituted
these experiments.”<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

</div>

<p>If the theory advanced by M.
Charbonnier, based on such doubtful
physiological facts, finds no
weight with the learned representative
of the Academy of Medicine,
it is not because he himself admits
the conclusions arrived at in the
study of M. Lefebvre on Louise Lateau.
For him, indeed, the events
taking place at Bois d’Haine,
apart from the question of fasting,
which has not been positively
established, and which, on that account,
rightly passes beyond scientific
discussion,<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> are exempt from
all fraud and deception. But let
M. Warlomont himself speak:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“After having analyzed,” he says, “the
memoir which the Academy has confided
to our examination, and having refuted
it principally in the portions which
concern Louise Lateau, it remains for us
in our turn to give our own ideas relative
to a fact of such interest which has
formed the subject of the memoir.</p>

<p>“And first of all, are the facts cited
real? According to our thinking, the
simulation of the ecstasies is simply impossible,
accompanied as they are by functional
troubles the provocation for which
would pass quite beyond the empire of
the will. As for the actual spontaneity
of the stigmata, we have demonstrated
this experimentally.”</p>

</div>

<p>And now for the chief part of
the report. It is that in which the
learned academician attempts to
give a physiological explanation
of the facts. For him ecstasies
are a species of double life, of a
second condition, such as may be
presented in ordinary and extraordinary
nervous states, as well
as in others: (<i>a</i>) in consequence
of material injury to the brain;
(<i>b</i>) during the existence of well-determined
neurotic disorders; (<i>c</i>)
under the influence of certain special
appliances (magnetism, hypnotism);
(<i>d</i>) spontaneously, without
the intervention of any external
provocation (as somnambulism
or extraordinary neurotic affections).</p>

<p>After having examined each of
these points in detail, the author
thus continues:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This point established, what of ecstasies?
Well, whatever we may do, it
is impossible for us not to class them in
the same order of facts, not to see in
them the influence of a neurotic perturbation
analogous to that which controls
neurotic diseases. It is in both cases
the passage of a human being into a
state of second condition, characterized
by the suspension, more or less complete,
of the exercise of the senses, with a special
concentration of all the cerebral powers
towards a limited object. Among the
ecstatics, as among the hypnotics, there
prevails a perturbation, diminution, or
abolition of external sensibility. All is
concentrated in a new cerebral functional
department.”</p>

</div>

<p>So far for the ecstasies. Passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_828" id="Page_828">[828]</a></span>
next to the production of stigmata,
the report admits in principle the
theory of Alfred Maury. That is
to say, the imagination plays the
principal <i lang="fr">rôle</i> in the production of
these phenomena. But to meet the
brilliant member of the Institute,
he calls to his aid the physiological
laws and most recent discoveries,
in order to show how the
imagination can, by the irritation of
certain given parts, provoke a veritable
congestion of those parts, and
then a hemorrhage.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In virtue of what mechanism,” he
asks, “are blisters first produced, and
bleeding afterwards? We have established
the genesis of stigmatic angiomata.<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>
The attention has given place to pain, and
pain to repeated touchings; from this
proceeds the congestion which has
brought on the arrest of the blood in the
capillaries, and, as a consequence, their
enlargement. Then comes the rush of
blood, giving place to congestive motions,
determined by a hemorrhagic
diathesis, and the phenomena disclose
themselves in all their simplicity; the
leucocytes<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> will pass across the capillaries,
will discharge themselves under
the skin, and the blister is the result.
The accumulation of blood continuing in
proportion to the enlargement of the capillaries,
the fleshly tegument will end
by bursting; then the blood itself, whether
by traversing the channels created by the
previous passage of the leucocytes, or by
the rupture of the vessels, the likelihood
of which can be sustained, ends by an
external eruption, and the hemorrhage
follows.”</p>

</div>

<p>But M. Warlomont goes still farther.
He says that not only are
stigmata and ecstasies capable of
explanation when taken apart from
one another, but that by their union
they constitute what in pathology
is called aggregate of symptoms. According
to this, stigmata and ecstasies
would constitute an altogether
unique morbid state, to which the
professor gives the following name
and definition: “Stigmatic neuropathy
is a nervous disease, having
its seat in the base of the <i lang="la">medulla
oblongata</i>, the first stage of which
consists in the paralysis of the vaso-motor
centre, and the second in
its excitation.” Presented in this
way, the report of the distinguished
member of the Academy was not
only a report, but a veritable original
work. Thus this book, wherein
the author had joined loyalty
of procedure to elegance of style
and deep erudition, produced a profound
sensation. The theory which
he advances might well leave certain
doubts with the reader relative
to the solidity of the bases on which
it leans, but by its method it exercised
a real fascination on the
mind. M. Warlomont’s conclusions
were, as far as the interpretation
of the facts went, diametrically
opposed to those of the book which
M. Lefebvre had published several
years before, and it was not without
a very great curiosity that the
public awaited the reply of the latter.</p>

<p>The reply was not long in coming.
M. Lefebvre’s discourse occupied,
so to say, exclusively the sessions
of May 29 and June 26. After
having rendered due homage to
the courtesy and science of the
distinguished reader of the report,
the Louvain professor hesitated
not to sustain the first conclusions
advanced in his book, and to demonstrate
the small foundation of
the theory of his adversary on this
question. It is to be regretted that
the limits at my disposal do not allow
me to enter into all the physiological
details and pathological considerations
on which M. Lefebvre
builds his conclusions. I regret it
the more because the brilliant words
of the orator exercise a very special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_829" id="Page_829">[829]</a></span>
impression by the clearness of
their exposition, the logic of their
reasoning, and the exquisite charm
which they give to even the driest
questions.</p>

<p>First, as to the stigmatic hemorrhages,
we cannot be astonished, after
having followed the proofs which
the learned orator gives us, to find
him lay down the following conclusions:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“1. M. Warlomont is driven to admit
a single vaso-motor centre; the most
recent researches are against this localization:
the vaso-motor centres are several
and disseminated.</p>

<p>“2. The distinguished reader of the
report constructs his doctrine of the action
of the imagination on a series of
hypotheses.</p>

<p>“The two chief ones are: that the imagination
has the power, every Friday
morning, of completely paralyzing the
vaso-motor centre and the vaso-constrictor
nerves; and after midday, by a
contradictory action, to excite violently
this centre, and consequently to close
up the vaso-constrictors&mdash;pure suppositions
which have not only not been
demonstrated by the author, but which
seem to me absolutely anti-physiological.</p>

<p>“3. Even admitting these hypotheses
as well founded, it is an established fact
that the complete paralysis of the vaso-motor
centres and of the vaso-constrictor
nerves is never followed by bleeding
on the surface of the skin; the experience
of all physiologists agrees on this
point.</p>

<p>“4. This experience proves, on the contrary,
that in such cases there are sometimes
produced suffusions of blood in
the mucous membranes; such suffusions
never show themselves in Louise Lateau.</p>

<p>“5. A series of hypotheses still more
complicated than those laid down as premises
by the distinguished reader of the
report might be conceded&mdash;to wit, the
paralysis of the arteries and the simultaneous
constriction of the veins. Experiment
again proves that even under
these conditions bleeding on the surface
of the skin is not produced.</p>

<p>“6. M. Warlomont, in parting from
the hypotheses which I have just combated,
admits that the bleeding produced
by the influence of the imagination
is a bleeding by transudation. But
the characteristics of transudation, studied
in the light of modern physiology, are
completely opposed to those of the stigmatic
bleeding of Louise Lateau.</p>

<p>“7. Finally&mdash;and this argument alone
will suffice to overthrow the thesis of
the distinguished reader of the report&mdash;clinical
observation, in accordance with
physiological induction, proves that in
circumstances where the imagination exercises
its greatest violence it never produces
bleeding on the surface of the
skin.”</p>

</div>

<p>Regarding ecstasies, the orator,
after having examined the different
states with which the reader of the
report to the Academy compared
the ecstasies of Louise Lateau, concludes
by saying:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I believe I have demonstrated that
the analysis of second conditions, brought
out with so much skill by the distinguished
gentleman, does not give the
key to the ecstasy of Louise Lateau.
But, setting aside these states of nervous
disease, should not the imagination be
made to bear all the burden of the ecstasy,
as it does of the stigmatization?”</p>

</div>

<p>After examining this question,
the orator concludes in the negative.
In finishing his beautiful discourse
he says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Our honorable colleague, in studying
the causes of the stigmatization and ecstasy,
has given to them a physiological
interpretation. On this ground I have
separated from him, and I believe I have
demonstrated that that interpretation is
not only insufficient, but also erroneous.
I believed for a moment that M. Warlomont
was about to offer an acceptable
scientific theory. I do not say a theory
complete and adequate&mdash;I am not so exacting;
I know too well that we do not
know the all of anything. If our eminent
colleague had proposed to us a physiological
interpretation, satisfying the most
moderate demands of science, I should
have accepted it, not with resignation,
but with joy and eagerness; and believe
me, gentlemen, my religious convictions
would have suffered no shock thereby.</p>

<p>“Our learned colleague, whom you
have charged with examining the events<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_830" id="Page_830">[830]</a></span>
of Bois d’Haine, has not, then, in my
opinion, given to them their physiological
interpretation. Other physicians have
attempted the same task; I name two of
them, because their works have been
produced within these walls.</p>

<p>“First of all, Dr. Boëns. In withdrawing
his memoir from the order of the
day of the Academy, he has withdrawn it
from our discussion. Nevertheless, I
believe I am not severe in affirming that
the considerations which claimed his attention,
and the irony of which he has
been so prodigal in my own regard, have
thrown but little light on the events of
Bois d’Haine. Dr. Charbonnier has submitted
to your appreciation a work of a
more scientific character. M. Warlomont
has examined it with the attention
which it deserves, and has refuted it. I
am thus dispensed from returning to it.</p>

<p>“I maintain, then, purely and simply,
the conclusions of my study: The stigmatization
and the ecstasies of Louise
Lateau are real and true facts, and
science has not furnished their physiological
interpretation.”</p>

</div>

<p>M. Crocq spoke after M. Lefebvre.
Like M. Warlomont, the
learned Brussels professor believes
that the interpretation of the facts
positively established about Louise
Lateau belongs to pathological physiology.
The theory of M. Crocq
differs but little from that of M. Warlomont.
He attaches more importance
to abstinence than the learned
reader of the report, and thus comes
nearer to M. Charbonnier; he believes,
also, that the bleeding is altogether
caused by a rupture of the
capillaries. Apart from these small
distinctions, it may be said of him,
as of M. Warlomont, that he is of
opinion that the imagination, by its
influence on the nervous system, is
the principal cause of the ecstasies
and stigmata. Here are the rest of
his conclusions:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I. The state of Louise Lateau is a
complex pathological state, characterized
by the following facts:</p>

<p>“1. Anæmia and weakness of constitution,
arising from privations endured
since childhood.</p>

<p>“2. Nervous exaltation produced by
anæmia and directed in a determined
sense by the education and religious
tendencies of Louise.</p>

<p>“3. Ecstasies constituting the supreme
degree of this exaltation.</p>

<p>“4. Bleeding, having for its starting
point anæmia and exaltation of the vaso-motor
nervous system.</p>

<p>“5. Relative abstinence, considerably
exaggerated by the sick girl, conformably
to what is observed among many
persons who suffer from nervous disorders.</p>

<p>“II. This state offers nothing contrary
to the laws of pathological physiology;
it is consequently useless to go outside
of that in search of explanation.</p>

<p>“III. It has the same characteristics as
all the analogous cases related by physicians
and historians; mysticism altogether,
save cases of jugglery and mystification,
ought to enter into the province
of pathology, which is vast enough to
contain it; and all the phenomena explain
themselves perfectly by taking as
starting point the principles which I have
laid down.”</p>

</div>

<p>If we had to advance our own
opinion on this important question,
we should say that, after the report
in which M. Warlomont had treated
his subject with so much method
and science, there remained few
new arguments which could be applied
to the physiological theory
of the phenomena of mystics. It
should be considered, however, no
small advantage for the latter physician
to feel himself supported by
M. Crocq, who had brought to the
debates the weight of his profound
erudition and vast experience.</p>

<h4>III.</h4>

<p>By all impartial judges the case
might be regarded as understood.
It was so in effect. The different
orators who succeeded each other
in the tribune of the Academy had
brought to their respective discourses
the strongest possible array<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_831" id="Page_831">[831]</a></span>
of facts and of arguments.
I shall astonish no one, then, by
saying that M. Warlomont could
not allow the victorious discourse
of his colleague of Louvain to pass
without some observations. It is
impossible for us here to give a
<i lang="fr">résumé</i> of his discourse. In the
main it added no new proof to the
substance of the debate, and confined
itself to the criticism of certain details.</p>

<p>It is enough for us to say that in
this discourse the learned reader
of the report to the Academy gave
new proof of the brilliancy of his
mind and the adroitness of his
gifts.</p>

<p>M. Lefebvre, on his side, felt himself
to be too much master of
the situation to need emphasizing
his triumph any further. This is
what he did in the session of October
9, 1875. Without precisely
entering into the heart of the debate,
he brought out more strongly
certain of the arguments which he
had already used; he employed
them to refute some of the assertions
made in the discourses of his
adversaries, held up certain inaccuracies,
and concluded, as he had
the right to do, by the following
words, which give an exact idea of
the state of the question:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Let us resume. M. Warlomont has
studied with earnestness and candor
the events of Bois d’Haine. He has
stated, as I have done, the reality of the
stigmatization and ecstasy; he has
demonstrated, as I have, that these phenomena
are free from any deception.
M. Crocq, after having examined the facts
on the spot, has arrived at the same conclusions.
The learned reader of the
committee’s report has built up a scientific
theory of the stigmatization and
ecstasy; the eminent Brussels professor
has, in his turn, formulated an interpretation
very nearly approaching to that of
M. Warlomont, but which differs from
it, nevertheless, on certain points. I
have sought, on my side, a physiological
explanation of these extraordinary facts,
and I have arrived at the conclusion that
science could furnish no satisfactory interpretation
of them. I have expounded
at length before the Academy the reasons
which prevent me from accepting the
theories of my two honorable opponents;
but my position is perfectly correct. I
confine myself to recognizing my powerlessness
to interpret the facts of Bois
d’Haine. M. Warlomont takes another
attitude. He pretends that we have a
scientific explanation of these phenomena.
We have not one&mdash;we have had
three or four; which is the true one?
Is it that of M. Boëns? Is it that of M.
Charbonnier, to which, beyond doubt,
you attach some importance, since you
have voted that it be printed? Is it that
of the learned reader of your report?
Begin by choosing. As for me, I hold
fast to my first conclusions: The facts
of Bois d’Haine have not received a
scientific interpretation.”</p>

</div>

<p>After certain remarks made at
the same session by MM. Vleminckx,
Crocq, Lefebvre, Masoin,
Boëns, the general discussion closed.
The printing of M. Charbonnier’s
memoir was decided on and
a vote of thanks to the author passed.
With this should have ended
the task of the Academy; and those
who had hoped for a physiological
interpretation of the facts of
Bois d’Haine, as the outcome of
these discussions, were in a position
to felicitate themselves on the
result; for by its absolute silence
the Academy allowed a certain
freedom of choice.</p>

<p>But during the session of July
10, 1875, which a family affliction
prevented M. Lefebvre from assisting
at, two members proposed orders
of the day on the discussion
of Bois d’Haine. Nevertheless,
by a very proper sentiment, which
the distinguished president, M.
Vleminckx, was the first to advance,
those orders of the day
were not carried at that date.</p>

<p>That of M. Kuborn was thus
conceived:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_832" id="Page_832">[832]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Academy, considering&mdash;</p>

<p>“That the phenomena really established
about the young girl of Bois d’Haine
are not new and are explicable by the
laws of pathological physiology;</p>

<p>“That the prolonged abstinence which
has been argued about has not been observed
by the committee;</p>

<p>“That no supervision, therefore, having
been established, and there having been
no chance of establishing it, the proper
thing was not to pause on the consideration
of this fact, but to consider it as not
having come up&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Academy follows its order of the
day as far as concerns the question of
the stigmatization and exstasy.”</p>

</div>

<p>Here is the order of the day proposed
by M. Crocq:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Academy, considering&mdash;</p>

<p>“That the phenomena established
about Louise Lateau are not beyond a
physiological explanation;</p>

<p>“That those which are not established
ought no longer to occupy our attention&mdash;</p>

<p>“Declares the discussion closed, and
passes to the order of the day.”</p>

</div>

<p>The same resolutions, the small
foundation for which, after the discourses
which had been made,
every impartial mind ought to recognize,
were again brought up in
the session of October 9.</p>

<p>M. Vleminckx, having induced
the authors of the orders of the
day to modify their wording in
such a manner as to render them
acceptable, M. Fossion proposed
the following form, more soothing
than its predecessors:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Royal Academy of Medicine declares
that the case of Louise Lateau has
not been completely scrutinized and cannot
serve as a base for serious discussion;
consequently, it closes the discussion.”</p>

</div>

<p>M. Laussedat, after some preliminary
remarks, finally proposed the
order of the day pure and simple,
which was adopted.</p>

<p>The bearing of this vote will escape
the mind of no one. In setting
aside the orders of the day
which pretended that what had
been positively established in the
question of Bois d’Haine might be
solved by science, the Academy has
fully confirmed the conclusions of
M. Lefebvre’s book.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in ending, let us return
to Bois d’Haine, to that young
girl who has become more than
ever the object of the veneration
of some, the study of others, and
the wonder of all.</p>

<p>Since 1868 Louise Lateau presents
the phenomena weekly of the
bloody stigmata and the ecstasies,
to which later on was added abstinence
from food.</p>

<p>Her first and chief historian, M.
Lefebvre, after having watched the
young girl, affirms since 1869: She,
whom a certain portion of the public
considers as a cheat or an invalid,
really presents the phenomena
which are reported of her. These
phenomena are exempt from trickery,
and it is impossible to explain
them by the laws of physiology and
pathology. We omit the question
of fasting, which remains to be
studied.</p>

<p>Seven years after the appearance
of the first phenomena, at the time
when the commotion which they
produced had, so to say, reached
its height, the leading learned body
in Belgium examined the mysterious
scenes in the humble house of
Bois d’Haine, and, through MM.
Crocq and Warlomont, made an
inquiry into the reality and sincerity
of the facts, and brings in a
verdict that the facts are real and
free from all fraud.</p>

<p>Finally, this same Belgian Royal
Academy of Medicine, by its vote,
avows in the face of the world that,
if it ought not to recognize a supernatural
cause in the facts about
Louise Lateau, as little can it demonstrate
their natural origin and
physiological genesis.</p>

<p>Such is the actual state of this
extraordinary question.</p>

<p>Few towns are set in so lovely a
frame as St. Jean de Luz, with its
incomparable variety of sea, mountain,
river, and plain. In front is
the dark blue bay opening into the
boundless sea. On the north are
the cliffs of Sainte Barbe. At the
south are the Gothic donjon and
massive jetty of Socoa, behind
which rises gradually a chain of
mountains, one above the other, from
wooded or vine-covered hills, dotted
here and there with the red-and-white
houses of the Basque
peasantry and the summer residences
of the wealthy merchants of
St. Jean de Luz, till we come to the
outer ramparts of La Rhune with
its granite cliffs and sharp peaks,
the Trois Couronnes with their jagged
outline, and still farther on a
long, blue line of mountains fading
away into the azure sea. It is from
La Rhune you can best take in all
the features of the country. To
go to it you use one of the modest
barks that have replaced the sumptuous
galleys of Louis Quatorze,
and ascend to Ascain, a pretty hamlet,
from which the summit of La
Rhune is reached in two hours.
It is not one of the highest in the
Pyrenean chain, being only three
thousand feet above the sea, but it
is an isolated peak, and affords a diversified
view of vast extent. To
the north are the green valleys of
Labourd, with the steeples of thirty
parishes around; Bayonne, with the
towers of its noble cathedral; and
the vast pine forests of the mysterious
Landes. To the west is the
coast of Spain washed by the
ocean. East and south are the
mountains of Béarn and Navarre,
showing peak after peak, like a sea
suddenly petrified in a storm.</p>

<p>Such is the magnificent frame in
which is set the historic town of St.
Jean de Luz. It is built on a tongue
of land washed by the encroaching
sea on one hand and the river Nivelle
on the other. The situation
is picturesque, the sky brilliant, the
climate mild. It seems to need
nothing to make it attractive. The
very aspect of decay lends it an
additional charm which renewed
prosperity would destroy. The
houses run in long lines parallel
with the two shores, looking, when
the tide is high, like so many ships
at anchor. At the sight of this
floating town we are not surprised
at its past commercial importance,
or that its inhabitants are navigators
<i lang="fr">par excellence</i>. Its sailors were
the first to explore the unknown
seas of the west, and to fish for the
cod and whale among the icebergs
of the arctic zone. In the first
half of the XVIIth century thirty
ships, each manned by thirty-five
or forty sailors, left St. Jean de
Luz for the cod-fisheries of Newfoundland,
and as many for Spitzbergen
in search of whales. The
oaks of La Rhune were cut down
for vessels. The town was wealthy
and full of activity. Those were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_834" id="Page_834">[834]</a></span>
the best days of ancient Lohitzun.
But though once so renowned for
its fleets, it has fallen from the
rank it then occupied. Ruined by
wars, and greatly depopulated by
the current of events, its houses
have decayed one after another, or
totally disappeared before the encroachments
of the sea. Reduced
to a few quiet streets, it is the mere
shadow of what it once was. Instead
of hundreds of vessels, only
a fishing-smack or two enliven its
harbor. And yet there is a certain
air of grandeur about the place
which bespeaks its past importance,
and several houses which
harmonize with its historic memories.
For St. Jean de Luz was not
only a place of commercial importance,
but was visited by several of
the kings of France, and is associated
with some of the most important
events of their reigns. Louis
XI. came here when mediating between
the kings of Aragon and
Castile. The château of Urtubi,
which he occupied, is some distance
beyond. Its fine park, watered
by a beautiful stream, and
the picturesque environs, make it
an attractive residence quite worthy
of royalty. The ivy-covered wall
on the north side is a part of the
old manor-house of the XIIth century;
the remainder is of the
XVIIth. The two towers have a
feudal aspect, but are totally innocent
of feudal domination; for the
Basque lords, even of the middle
ages, never had any other public
power than was temporarily conferred
on them by their national
assemblies.</p>

<p>It was at St. Jean de Luz that
Francis I., enthusiastically welcomed
by the people after his
deliverance from captivity in Spain,
joyfully exclaimed: “<i lang="fr">Je suis encore
roi de France</i>&mdash;I am still King
of France!” It likewise witnessed
the exchange of the beautiful Elizabeth
of France and Anne of Austria&mdash;one
given in marriage to Louis
XIII. and the other to Philip of
Spain amid the acclamations of the
people.</p>

<p>Cardinal Mazarin also visited St.
Jean de Luz in 1659 to confer with
the astute Don Luis de Haro, prime
minister of Philip IV., about the
interests of France and Spain. The
house he inhabited beside the sea still
has his cipher on the walls, as it has
also the old Gobelin tapestry with
which his apartments were hung.
He was accompanied by one hundred
and fifty gentlemen, some of
whom were the greatest lords in
France. With them were as many
attendants, a guard of one hundred
horsemen and three hundred foot-soldiers,
twenty-four mules covered
with rich housings, seven carriages
for his personal use, and several
horses to ride. He remained here
four months. His interviews with
the Spanish minister took place on
the little island in the Bidassoa
known ever since as the Isle of
Conference, which was never heard
of till the treaty of the Pyrenees.
All national interviews and exchanges
of princesses had previously
taken place in the middle of the
river by means of <i lang="fr">gabares</i>, or a
bridge of boats.</p>

<p>It was this now famous isle which
Bossuet apostrophized in his <i lang="fr">oraison
funèbre</i> at the burial of Queen
Marie Thérèse:</p>

<p>“Pacific isle, in which terminated
the differences of the two great empires
of which you were the limit;
in which were displayed all the skill
and diplomacy of different national
policies; in which one statesman
secured preponderance by his deliberation,
and the other ascendency
by means of his penetration!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_835" id="Page_835">[835]</a></span>
Memorable day, in which two
proud nations, so long at enmity,
but now reconciled by Marie Thérèse,
advanced to their borders
with their kings at their head, not
to engage in battle, but for a friendly
embrace; in which two sovereigns
with their courts, each with
its peculiar grandeur and magnificence,
as well as etiquette and
manners, presented to each other
and to the whole universe so august
a spectacle&mdash;how can I now
mingle your pageants with these
funeral solemnities, or dwell on the
height of all human grandeur in
sight of its end?”</p>

<p>The marriage of Louis XIV. with
the Spanish Infanta, to which the
great orator refers, is still the most
glorious remembrance of St. Jean
de Luz. The visits of Louis XI.,
Francis I., and Charles IX. have
left but few traces in the town
compared with that of the <i lang="fr">Grand
Monarque</i>. The majestic presence
of the young king surrounded by
his gay, magnificent following, here
brought in contrast with the dignity,
gloom, and splendor of the Spanish
court, impressed the imagination
of the people, who have never forgotten
so glorious a memory.</p>

<p>Louis XIV. arrived at St. Jean
de Luz May 8, 1660, accompanied
by Anne of Austria, Cardinal Mazarin,
and a vast number of lords
and ladies, among whom was the
<i lang="fr">Grande Mademoiselle</i>. They were
enthusiastically welcomed by the
ringing of bells, firing of cannon,
and shouts of joy. Garlands of
flowers arched the highway, the
pavement was strewn with green
leaves, and Cantabrian dances were
performed around the cortége.
At the door of the parish church
stood the clergy in full canonicals,
with the <i lang="fr">curé</i> at their head
to bless the king as he went
past. He resided, while there, in
the château of Lohobiague, the
fine towers of which are still to be
seen on the banks of the Nivelle.
It is now known as the House of
Louis XIV. Here he was entertained
by the widowed <i lang="fr">châtelaine</i>
with the sumptuous hospitality for
which the family was noted. A
light gallery was put up to connect
the château with that of Joanocnia,
in which lodged Anne of Austria
and the Spanish Infanta. Here
took place the first interview between
the king and his bride, described
by Mme. de Motteville in
her piquant manner. From the
gallery the Infanta, after her marriage,
took pleasure in throwing
handfuls of silver coin to the people,
called <i lang="fr">pièces de largesses</i>, struck
by the town expressly for the occasion,
with the heads of the royal
pair on one side and on the other
St. Jean de Luz in a shower of
gold, with the motto: <i lang="la">Non lætior
alter</i>.</p>

<p>The château of Joanocnia, frequently
called since that time the
château of the Infanta, was built by
Joannot de Haraneder, a merchant
of the place, who was ennobled for
his liberality when the island of
Rhé was besieged by the English
in 1627, and about to surrender to
the Duke of Buckingham for want
of supplies and reinforcements.
The Comte de Grammont, governor
of Bayonne, being ordered by Richelieu
to organize an expedition at
once for the relief of the besieged,
issued a command for every port to
furnish its contingent. St. Jean de
Luz eagerly responded by sending
a large flotilla, and Joannot de
Haraneder voluntarily gave the
king two vessels, supplied with artillery,
worthy of figuring in the
royal navy. For this and subsequent
services he was ennobled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_836" id="Page_836">[836]</a></span>
His arms are graven in marble
over the principal fire-place of the
château&mdash;a plum-tree on an anchor,
with the motto:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Dans l’ancre le beau prunier</div>
<div class="verse">Est rendu un fort riche fructier.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This château, though somewhat
devoid of symmetry, has a certain
beauty and originality of its own,
with its alternate rows of brick and
cream-colored stone, after the
Basque fashion, its Renaissance
portico between two square towers
facing the harbor, and the light
arches of the two-story gallery in
the Venetian style. Over the principal
entrance is a marble tablet
with the following inscription in
letters of gold:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“L’Infante je reçus l’an mil six cent soixante.</div>
<div class="verse">On m’appelle depuis le chasteau de l’Infante.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The letter L and the <i lang="fr">fleur-de-lis</i>
are to be seen as we ascend the
grand staircase, and two paintings
by Gérôme after the style of the
XVIIth century, recalling the alliance
of France and Spain and
the well-known <i lang="fr">mot</i> of Louis XIV.:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Il n’y a plus de Pyrénées!”</p>

</div>

<p>All the details of the residence
of the royal family here, as related
by Mme. de Motteville and Mlle.
de Montpensier, are full of curious
interest. The former describes
the beautiful Isle of Conference
and the superb pavilion for the
reunion of the two courts, with two
galleries leading towards France
and Spain. This building was
erected by the painter Velasquez,
who, as <i lang="es">aposentador mayor</i>, accompanied
Philip IV. to the frontier.
This fatiguing voyage had an unfavorable
effect on the already declining
health of the great painter,
and he died a few weeks after his
return.</p>

<p>During the preliminary arrangements
for the marriage Louis led
a solemn, uniform life. Like the
queen-mother, who was always present
at Mass, Vespers, and Benediction,
he daily attended public services,
sometimes at the Recollects’
and sometimes at the parish church.
He always dined in public at the
château of Lohobiague, surrounded
by crowds eager to witness the
process of royal mastication. In
the afternoon there were performances
by comedians who had followed
the court from Paris; and
sometimes Spanish mysteries, to
which Queen Anne was partial,
were represented, in which the actors
were dressed as hermits and
nuns, and sacred events were depicted,
to the downright scandal
of the great mademoiselle. The
day ended with a ball, in which the
king did not disdain to display the
superior graces of his royal person
in a <i lang="fr">ballet compliqué</i>. Everything,
in short, was quite in the style of
the <em>Grand Cyrus</em> itself.</p>

<p>The marriage, which had taken
place at Fontarabia by procuration,
was personally solemnized in the
parish church of St. Jean de Luz
by the Bishop of Bayonne in the
presence of an attentive crowd.
The door by which the royal couple
entered was afterwards walled
up, that it might never serve for any
one else&mdash;a not uncommon mark
of respect in those days. A joiner’s
shop now stands against this
Porta Regia. The king presented
the church on this occasion with a
complete set of sacred vessels and
ecclesiastical vestments.</p>

<p>The church in which Louis XIV.
was married is exteriorly a noble
building with an octagonal tower,
but of no architectural merit within.
There are no side aisles, but
around the nave are ranges of galleries
peculiar to the Basque
churches, where the separation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_837" id="Page_837">[837]</a></span>
the men from the women is still
rigorously maintained. The only
piece of sculpture is a strange <i lang="it">Pietà</i>
in which the Virgin, veiled in a
large cope, holds the dead Christ
on her knees. A rather diminutive
angel, in a flowing robe with
pointed sleeves of the time of
Charles VII., bears a scroll the inscription
of which has become illegible.</p>

<p>Behind the organ, in the obscurity
of the lower gallery of the
church, hangs a dark wooden frame&mdash;short
but broad&mdash;with white corners,
which contains a curious painting
of the XVIIth century representing
Christ before Pilate. It is
by no means remarkable as a work
of art; for it is deficient in perspective,
there is no grace in the drapery,
no special excellence of coloring.
The figures are generally
drawn with correctness, but the
faces seem rather taken from pictures
than from real life. But however
poor the execution, this painting
merits attention on account of
its dramatic character. The composition
represents twenty-six persons.
At the left is Pontius Pilate,
governor of Judea, seated in a large
arm-chair beneath a canopy, pointing
with his left hand towards the
Saviour before him. In his right
hand he holds a kind of sceptre;
his beard is trimmed in the style of
Henri Quatre; he wears a large
mantle lined with ermine, and on
his head a <i lang="fr">toque</i>, such as the old
presidents of parliament used to
wear in France.</p>

<p>Below Pilate is the clerk recording
the votes in a large register,
and before him is the urn in which
they are deposited.</p>

<p>In front of the clerk, but separated
from him by a long white scroll
on which is inscribed the sentence
pronounced by Pilate, is seated our
Saviour, his loins girded with a
strip of scarlet cloth, his bowed
head encircled by luminous rays,
his attitude expressive of humility
and submission, his bound hands
extended on his knees.</p>

<p>In the centre of the canvas,
above this group, is the high-priest
Caiaphas standing under an arch,
his head thrown back, and his
hands extended in an imposing attitude.
He wears a cap something
like a mitre, a kind of stole is crossed
on his breast, his long robe is
adorned with three flounces of lace.
His face is that of a young man.
The slight black mustache he
wears is turned up in a way that
gives him a resemblance to Louis
XIII. It is evidently a portrait of
that age.</p>

<p>At the side of Pilate, and behind
Christ, are ranged the members of
the Jewish Sanhedrim, standing or
sitting, in various postures, with
white scrolls in their hands, which
they hold like screens, bearing their
names and the expression of their
sentiments respecting the divine
Victim. Their dress is black or
white, but varied in form. Most
of them wear a <i lang="fr">mosette</i>, or ermine
cape, and the collar of some order
of knighthood, as of S. Michael
and the S. Esprit. They are all
young, have mustaches, and look
as if they belonged to the time of
Louis Treize. On their heads are
turbans, or <i lang="fr">toques</i>.</p>

<p>Through the open window, at
the end of the pretorium, may be
seen the mob, armed with spears,
and expressing its sentiments by
means of a scroll at the side of the
window: “If thou let this man
go, thou art not Cæsar’s friend.
Crucify him! crucify him! His
blood be on us and on our children.”</p>

<p>The chief interest of the picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_838" id="Page_838">[838]</a></span>
centres in these inscriptions, which
are in queer old French of marvellous
orthography. At the bottom
of the painting, to the left, is the
following:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Sentence, or decree, of the sanguinary
Jews against Jesus Christ, the Saviour
of the world.”</p>

</div>

<p>Over Pilate we read:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Pontius Pilate Judex.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>The sentiments of the high-priests
and elders, whose names we give
in the original, are thus expressed:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“1. <span class="smcap">Simon Lepros.</span> For what cause
or reason is he held for mutiny or sedition?</p>

<p>“2. <span class="smcap">Raban.</span> Wherefore are laws
made, I pray, unless to be kept and executed?</p>

<p>“3. <span class="smcap">Achias.</span> No one should be condemned
to death whose cause is not
known and weighed.</p>

<p>“4. <span class="smcap">Sabath.</span> There is no law or right
by which one not proved guilty is condemned;
wherefore we would know in
what way this man hath offended.</p>

<p>“5. <span class="smcap">Rosmophin.</span> For what doth the
law serve, if not executed?</p>

<p>“6. <span class="smcap">Putéphares.</span> A stirrer-up of the
people is a scourge to the land; therefore
he should be banished.</p>

<p>“7. <span class="smcap">Riphar.</span> The penalty of the
law is prescribed only for malefactors
who should be made to confess their
misdeeds and then be condemned.</p>

<p>“8. <span class="smcap">Joseph d’Aramathea.</span> Truly, it
is a shameful thing, and detestable, there
be no one in this city who seeks to defend
the innocent.</p>

<p>“9. <span class="smcap">Joram.</span> How can we condemn
him to death who is just?</p>

<p>“10. <span class="smcap">Ehieris.</span> Though he be just,
yet shall he die, because by his preaching
he hath stirred up and excited the
people to sedition.</p>

<p>“11. <span class="smcap">Nicodemus.</span> Our law condemns
and sentences to death no man for an
unknown cause.</p>

<p>“12. <span class="smcap">Diarabias.</span> He hath perverted
the people; therefore is he guilty and
worthy of death.</p>

<p>“13. <span class="smcap">Sareas.</span> This seditious man
should be banished as one born for the
destruction of the land.</p>

<p>“14. <span class="smcap">Rabinth.</span> Whether he be just
or not, inasmuch as he will neither obey
nor submit to the precepts of our forefathers,
he should not be tolerated in the
land.</p>

<p>“15. <span class="smcap">Josaphat.</span> Let him be bound
with chains and be perpetually imprisoned.</p>

<p>“16. <span class="smcap">Ptolomée.</span> Though it be not
clear whether he is just or unjust, why
do we hesitate: why not at once condemn
him to death or banish him?</p>

<p>“17. <span class="smcap">Teras.</span> It is right he should be
banished or sent to the emperor.</p>

<p>“18. <span class="smcap">Mesa.</span> If he is a just man, why
do we not yield to his teachings: if
wicked, why not send him away?</p>

<p>“19. <span class="smcap">Samech.</span> Let us weigh the case,
so he have no cause to contradict us.
Whatever he does, let us chastise him.</p>

<p>“20. <span class="smcap">Caïphas Pontifex.</span> Ye know
not well what ye would have. It is expedient
for us that one man should die
for the people, and that the whole nation
perish not.</p>

<p>“21. <span class="smcap">The People To Pilate.</span> If thou
let this man go, thou art not the friend of
Cæsar. Crucify him! crucify him! His
blood be on us and on our children!”</p>

</div>

<p>On the large scroll in the centre
of the picture is the sentence of
Pilate:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I, Pontius Pilate, pretor and judge in
Jerusalem under the thrice powerful Emperor
Tiberius, whose reign be eternally
blessed and prospered, in this tribunal,
or judicial chair, in order to pronounce
and declare sentence for the synagogue
of the Jewish nation with respect to Jesus
Christ here present, by them led and accused
before me, that, being born of father
and mother of poor and base extraction,
he made himself by lofty and blasphemous
words the Son of God and King of the
Jews, and boasted he could rebuild the
temple of Solomon, having heard and examined
the case, do say and declare on
my conscience he shall be crucified between
two thieves.”</p>

</div>

<p>This picture is analogous to the
old mysteries of the Passion once so
popular in this region, in which the
author who respected the meaning
of the sacred text was at liberty to
draw freely on his imagination. It
was especially in the dialogue that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_839" id="Page_839">[839]</a></span>
lay the field for his genius. However
naïve these sacred dramas,
they greatly pleased the people. A
painting similar to this formerly existed
in St. Roch’s Church at Paris,
in which figured the undecided Pilate
in judicial array, Caiaphas the
complacent flatterer of the people,
and the mob with its old <i lang="fr">rôle</i> of
“Crucify him! crucify him!”</p>

<p>We must not forget a work of art,
of very different character, associated
with the history of St. Jean de
Luz. It is a curious piece of needle-work
commemorating the conferences
of the two great statesmen,
Cardinal Mazarin and Don Luis de
Haro, and evidently designed by
an able artist, perhaps by Velasquez
himself. It is a kind of <i lang="fr">courte-pointe</i>
(it would never do to call it by the
ignoble name of coverlet!) of linen
of remarkable fineness, on which
are embroidered in purple silk the
eminent personages connected with
the treaty of the Pyrenees, as well
as various allegorical figures and
accessory ornaments, which make
it a genuine historic picture of
lively and interesting character.
This delicate piece of Spanish
needle-work was wrought by the
order of Don Luis de Haro as a
mark of homage to his royal master.
He presented it to the king on his
feast-day, May 1, 1661, and it probably
adorned the royal couch.
But the better to comprehend this
work of art&mdash;for such it is, in spite
of its name&mdash;let us recall briefly
the events that suggested its details.</p>

<p>Philip IV. ascended the Spanish
throne in 1621, when barely sixteen
years of age. His reign lasted till
1665. He had successively two
ministers of state, both of great
ability, but of very different political
views. In the first part of his
reign the young monarch gave his
whole confidence to the Count of
Olivares, whose authority was almost
absolute till 1648. But his
ministry was far from fortunate.
On the contrary, it brought such
humiliating calamities on the country
that the king at length awoke
to the danger that menaced it.
He dismissed Olivares and appointed
the count’s nephew and
heir in his place, who proved one
of the ablest ministers ever known
in Spain. He was a descendant of
the brave Castilian lord to whom
Alfonso VII. was indebted for the
capture of Zurita, but who would
accept no reward from the grateful
prince but the privilege of giving
the name of Haro to a town he had
built. It was another descendant
of this proud warrior who was
made archbishop of Mexico in the
latter part of the XVIIIth century,
and was so remarkable for his charity
and eloquence as a preacher.</p>

<p>Don Luis not only had the
military genius of his ancestor, but
the prudence of a real statesman,
and he succeeded in partially repairing
the disasters of the preceding
ministry. He raised an army
and equipped a powerful squadron,
by which he repulsed the French,
checked the Portuguese, brought
the rebellious provinces into subjection,
and effected the treaty of
Munster; which energetic measures
produced such an effect on
the French government as to lead
to amicable relations between the
two great ministers who, at this
time, held the destiny of Europe in
their hands, and to bring about a
general peace in 1659.</p>

<p>It was with this object Cardinal
Mazarin and Don Luis de Haro
agreed upon a meeting on the <i lang="fr">Ile
des Faisans</i>&mdash;as the Isle of Conference
was then called&mdash;which led to
the treaty of the Pyrenees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_840" id="Page_840">[840]</a></span></p>

<p>As a reward for Don Luis’ signal
services, particularly the peace he
had cemented by an alliance so honorable
to the nation, Philip IV., in
the following year, conferred on him
the title of duke, and gave him the
surname <i lang="es">de la Paz</i>.</p>

<p>It was at this time Don Luis had
this curious <i lang="fr">courte-pointe</i> wrought as
a present to the king. He was
the declared patron of the fine arts,
and had established weekly reunions
to bring together the principal artists
of Spain, some of whom probably
designed this memorial of his
glory. It was preserved with evident
care, and handed down from
one sovereign to another, till it
finally fell into the possession of the
mother of Ferdinand VII., who,
wishing to express her sense of the
fidelity of one of her ladies of
honor, gave her this valuable counterpane.
In this way it passed into
the hands of its present owner
at Bayonne.</p>

<p>On the upper part of this covering
the power of Spain is represented
by a woman holding a subdued
lion at her feet. In the centre
are Nuestra Señora del Pilar
and S. Ferdinand, patrons of the
kingdom, around whom are the
eagles of Austria, so closely allied
to Spain. And by way of allusion
to the <i lang="fr">Ile des Faisans</i>, where the recent
negotiations had taken place,
pheasants are to be seen in every
direction. Cardinal Mazarin and
Don Luis de Haro are more than
once represented. In one place
they are presenting an olive branch
to the powers they serve; in another
they are advancing, side by
side, towards Philip IV., to solicit
the hand of his daughter for Louis
XIV. Here Philip gives his consent
to the marriage, and, lower
down, Louis receives his bride in
the presence of two females who
personify France and Spain. The
intermediate spaces are filled up with
allusions to commerce with foreign
lands and the progress of civilization
at home. Not only war, victory,
and politics have their emblems,
but literature, beneficence,
and wealth. But there are many
symbols the meaning of which it
would require the sagacity of a
Champollion to fathom.</p>

<p>This is, perhaps, the only known
instance of a prime minister directing
his energies to the fabrication
of a counterpane. Disraeli, to be
sure, has woven many an extravagant
web of romance with Oriental
profusion of ornament, but not, to
our knowledge, in purple and fine
linen, like Don Luis de Haro. We
have seen one of the gorgeous coverlets
of Louis XIV., but it was
wrought by the young ladies of St.
Cyr under the direction of Mme.
de Maintenon; and there is another
in the Hôtel de Cluny that
once belonged to Francis I. The
grand-daughter of Don Luis de
Haro, the sole heiress of the house,
married the Duke of Alba, carrying
with her as a dowry the vast
possessions of Olivares, Guzman,
and Del Carpio. The brother-in-law
of the ex-Empress Eugénie is
a direct descendant of theirs.</p>

<p>Opposite St. Jean de Luz, on the
other side of the Nivelle, is Cibourre,
with its solemn, mysterious
church, and its widowed houses
built along the quay and straggling
up the hill of Bordagain. Prosperous
once like its neighbor, it also
participated in its misfortunes, and
now wears the same touching air
of melancholy. The men are all
sailors&mdash;the best sailors in Europe&mdash;but
they are absent a great part of
the year. Fearless wreckers live
along the shore, who brave the
greatest dangers to aid ships in distress.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_841" id="Page_841">[841]</a></span>
In more prosperous days
its rivalry with St. Jean de Luz often
led to quarrels, and the islet
which connects the two places was
frequently covered with the blood
shed in these encounters. The
convent of Recollects, now a custom-house,
which we pass on our
way to Cibourre, was founded in
expiation of this mutual hatred,
and very appropriately dedicated to
<i lang="fr">Notre Dame de la Paix</i>&mdash;Our Lady
of Peace. The cloister, with its
round arches, is still in good preservation,
and the cistern is to be
seen in the court, constructed by
Cardinal Mazarin, that the friars
might have a supply of soft water.</p>

<p>The Basques are famed for their
truthfulness and honesty, the result
perhaps of the severity of their ancient
laws, one of which ordered a
tooth to be extracted every time a
person was convicted of lying! No
wonder the love of truth took such
deep <em>root</em> among them. But had this
stringent law been handed down
and extended to other lands, what
toothless communities there would
now be in the world!</p>

<h3>THE ETERNAL YEARS.</h3>

<p class="center">BY THE AUTHOR OF “THE DIVINE SEQUENCE.”</p>

<h4>II.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE PULSATIONS OF TIME.</span></h4>

<p>The deduction we arrive at from
the argument which we have laid
down is that the history of the
world is a consistent one, and not
a series of loose incidents strung
together. It is as much this morally,
it is as truly the evolution
and unwinding of a high moral law
and of a great spiritual truth, as
the life of the plant from the seed
to the ripe fruit is the development
of a natural growth. This last
is governed by laws with which
we are only partially acquainted;
whereas the moral law and the
spiritual truth are revealed to us by
the divine scheme of creation and
redemption. There is nothing existing,
either in the natural or in
the spiritual law, and especially in
this last, which is not more or less,
in one way or in another, by assertion
or by negation, a revelation of
the divine Being.</p>

<p>He reveals himself directly by
his volitions and indirectly by his
permissions. And we can only be
one with him when we have learnt
to accept both and to submit to
both; not in the spirit of quietism
or fatalism, but as actively entering
into his intentions, accepting what
he wills, and bearing what he permits.
There is no harmony possible
between the soul and God until
we have arrived at this; and
the history of the world is the history
of man’s acquiescence in, or
resistance to, the supreme will of
God. The first disruption of the
will of man from the will of God,
in the fall of man, wove a dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_842" id="Page_842">[842]</a></span>
woof into the web of time; and
every act of ours which is not according
to the will of God weaves
the same into our own lives, because
it is a rupture of the law of
harmony which God has instituted
between himself as creator and us
as creatures. Were that harmony
unbroken, man would rest in God
as in his centre; for, being finite,
he has no sufficiency in himself, but
for ever seeks some good extrinsic
to himself. The same applies to
all creation, whose ultimate end and
highest good must always be some
object beyond, and above itself;
and that object is none other than
God, “quod ignorantes colitis,”<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>&mdash;the
finite striving after the Infinite.
Thus the whole divine government
of the world is a gradual unfolding
of the divine Will, according as
we are able to receive it. And the
degree of receptivity in mankind,
at various periods of the world’s
history, and in different localities,
accounts for the variety in the divine
dispensations, and for the
imperfection of some as compared
with others. The “yet more excellent
way”<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> could not be received
by all at all times. The promise
was given to Abraham. But four
hundred and thirty years elapsed
before its fulfilment, for the express
purpose of being occupied and
spent in the institution of the law
as a less perfect dispensation, and
which was given because of transgressions&mdash;“propter
transgressiones posita est”<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>&mdash;thus showing the
adaptive government of God: the
gradual building up of the city of
the Lord, whose stones are the living
souls of men, which are “hewed
and made ready,”<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> but so that
there shall be “neither hammer,
nor axe, nor tool of iron heard”
while it is building. For God
does not force his creature. He
pours not “new wine into old bottles,”
but waits in patience the
growth of his poor creatures, and
the slow and gradual leavening of
the great mass. A time had been
when God walked with man “at
the afternoon air”;<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> and whatever
may be the full meaning of this
exquisitely-expressed intercourse,
at least it must have been intimate
and tender. But when the black
pall of evil fell on the face of creation,
the light of God’s intercourse
with man was let in by slow degrees,
like single stars coming out
in the dark firmament. The revelations,
like the stars, varied in
magnitude and glory, lay wide apart
from each other, rose at different
intervals of longer or shorter duration,
and conveyed, like them, a
flickering and uncertain light, until
the “Sun of Justice arose with
health in his wings,”<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> and “scattered
the rear of darkness thin.”
The degree of light vouchsafed
was limited by the capacity of the
recipient; and that capacity has
not always been the same in all
ages, any more than in any one
age it is the same in all the contemporary
men, or in each man the
same at all periods of his life. It
is thus that we arrive at the explanation
of an apparent difference of
tone, color, and texture, so to speak,
in the various manifestations of
God to man. The manifestation is
limited to the capacity of the recipient;
and not only is it limited,
but to a certain extent it becomes,
as it were, tinged by the properties
of the medium through which it is
transmitted to others. It assumes
characteristics that are not essentially
its own. For so marvellous
is the respect with which the Creator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_843" id="Page_843">[843]</a></span>
treats the freedom of his creature
that he suffers us to give a
measure of our own color to what
he reveals to us, so that it may be
more our own, more on our level,
more within our grasp; as though
he poured the white waters of saving
truth into glasses of varied
colors, and thus hid from us a
pellucidity too perfect for our nature.
And thus it happens that to us
who dwell in the light of God’s
church, with the seven lamps of
the seven sacraments burning in
the sanctuary, the God of Abraham
and of Isaac and of Jacob hardly
seems to us the same God as our
God. We see him through the
prism of the past, amid surroundings
that are strange to us,
in the old patriarchal life that
seems so impossible a mode of
existence to the denizens of great
cities in modern Europe.</p>

<p>This is equally true throughout
the history of the world. It is also
true of every individual soul; and
it is true of the same soul at different
periods of its existence. He is
the same God always and everywhere.
But there is a difference
in the kind of reception which each
soul gives to that portion of divine
knowledge and grace which it is
capable of receiving and which it
actually does receive. For they
are “divers kinds of vessels, every
little vessel, from the vessels of
cups even to every instrument of
music.”<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> They differ in capacity
and they differ in material; and
the great God, in revealing himself,
does so by degrees. He has deposited,
as it were, the whole treasure
of himself in the bosom of his
spouse, the church; but the births
of new grace and further developed
truth only come to us as we can
bear them and when we can bear
them. The body of truth is all
there; but the dispensing of that
truth varies in degree as time goes
on. God governs in his own world;
but he does so behind and through
the human instruments whom he
condescends to employ. And as,
in the exercise of his own free-will,
man chose the evil and refused the
good, so has the Almighty accommodated
himself to the conditions
which man has instituted. Were
he to do otherwise, he would force
the will of his creature, which he
never will do, because the doing it
would have for result to deprive
that creature of all moral status
and reduce him to a machine.
From the moment that we lose the
power of refusing the good and
taking the evil, from the moment
that any force really superior to
that which has been put into the
arsenals of our own being robs us
of the faculty of selection, we lose
all merit and consequently all demerit.
The Creator, when he made
man, surrounded him with the respect
due to a being who had the
power of disposing of his own
everlasting destiny. Nor has he
ever done, nor will he do, anything
which can entrench on this prerogative.
The whole system of grace
is a system divinely devised to afford
man aid in the selection he
has to make. There lies an atmosphere
of grace all around our souls,
as there lies the air we breathe
around our senses. The one is as
frequently unperceived by us as the
other.<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> We are without consciousness
as regards its presence, as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_844" id="Page_844">[844]</a></span>
are without direct habitual consciousness
of the act of breathing
and of our own existence, except
as from time to time we make a reflective
modification in our own
mind of the idea of the air and of
the fact of our inhaling it. We are
unconscious that it is the divine
Creator who is for ever sustaining
our physical existence. We are
oblivious of it for hours together,
unless we stop and think. It is
the same with the presence of
grace.</p>

<p>And though “exciting” grace, as
theology calls it, begins with the illustration
of the intellect, it does
not follow that we are always by
any means conscious of this illustration.
It is needless to carry out
the theological statement in these
pages. What we have said is enough
to bring us round to our point, which
is that the action of grace on the
individual soul, and the long line
of direct and indirect revelations
of God’s will from the creation to
the present hour, though always
the same grace and always the
same revelation, receive different
renderings according to the vehicle
in which they are held&mdash;much as a
motive in music remains the same
air, though transposed from one key
to another. Not only, therefore,
does man, as it were, give a color
of his own to the revelation of
God, but he has the sad faculty of
limiting its flow and circumscribing
its course, even where he cannot
altogether arrest it. We are
“slow of heart to believe,” and therefore
is the time delayed when the
still unfulfilled promises may take effect.
Our Lord declares that Moses
<em>permitted</em> the Hebrews to put away
their wives, because of the hardness
of their hearts; “but from
the beginning it was not so.”<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>
God’s law had never in itself been
other than what the church has declared
it to be. The state of matrimony,
as God had ordained it,
was always meant to be what the
church has now defined. But man
was not in a condition to receive
so perfect a law; and thus the
condition of man&mdash;that is, the hardness
of his heart&mdash;had the effect of
modifying the apparent will of
God, as revealed in what we now
know to be one of the seven sacraments.
The Hebrews were incapable
of anything more than a mutilated,
or rather a truncated, expression
of the divine will, as it
was represented to them in the law
of Moses on the married state.
Nor could we anywhere find a
more perfect illustration of our argument.
In the first place, it is
given us by our Lord himself; and,
in the second, it occurs on a subject
which, taken in its larger sense,
involves almost every other, lies at
the root of the whole world of
matter, and of being through matter,
and may be called the representative
idea of the creation.
Now, if on such a question as this
mankind, at some period of their
existence, and that a period which
includes ages of time, and covers,
at one interval or another, the
whole vast globe, could only <em>bear</em>
an imperfect and utterly defective
rendering, how much more must
there exist to be still further developed
out of the “things new and
old” which lie in the womb of
time and in the treasures of the
church, but which are waiting for
the era when we shall be in a condition
to receive them! The whole
system of our Lord’s teaching was
based on this principle. He seems,
if we may so express it, afraid of
overburdening his disciples by too
great demands upon their capacity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_845" id="Page_845">[845]</a></span>
He says with reference to the mission
of S. John the Baptist: “<em>If</em>
you will receive it, he is Elias that
is to come,”<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> and in the Sermon
on the Mount he points out to
them the imperfection of the old
moral code, as regarded the taking
of oaths and the law of talion.
Now, the moral law, as it existed in
the mind of God, could never have
varied. It must always have been
“perfect as our heavenly Father is
perfect.” But it passed through an
imperfect medium&mdash;the one presented
by the then condition of mankind&mdash;and
was modified accordingly.</p>

<p>We hold, therefore, in what we
have now stated, a distinct view of
the way in which God governs the
world; not absolutely, not arbitrarily,
but <em>adaptively</em>. And where
we see imperfection, and at times
apparent retrogression, it is the free
will of man forcing the will of God
to his own destruction, “until he
who hindereth now, and will hinder,
be taken out of the way.”<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>If this be true of God’s direct revelations
of himself, and of his moral
law as given from time to time
to mankind, according as, in their
fallen state, they could receive it&mdash;if,
in short, it be true of his direct
volitions&mdash;it is also true of his permissions.
If it hold good of the
revelations of his antecedent will,
it holds good of the instances (so
far as we may trace them in the
history of the world) of his consequent
will; that is, of his will which
takes into consideration the facts
induced by man in the exercise of
his own free will, which is so constantly
running counter to the
antecedent will of God. The
divine permissions form the negative
side of the revelation of God.
They are his permissive government
of the world, not his direct
government. The direct government
is the stream of revelation
given to our first parents, to the
patriarchs and lawgivers of Israel,
and now, in a more direct and immediate
way, through our Blessed
Lord in his birth, death, and resurrection,
by the church in the sacraments,
and through her temporal
head, the vicar of Christ.</p>

<p>Even now, when he has consummated
his union with his church,
and that she is the true organ of
the Holy Ghost, and thus the one
true and infallible medium and
interpreter of God’s direct government
of the world, he also governs
it by the indirect way of his overruling
providence. The events
which occur in history have ever a
double character. They have their
mere human aspect, often apparently
for evil alone; and they have
their ultimate result for good,
which is simply the undercurrent
of God’s will working upwards, and
through the actions of mankind.
Events which, on the face of them,
bear the character of unmitigated
evils, like war, have a thousand
ultimate beneficial results. War is
the rude, cruel pioneer of the armies
of the Lord; for where the soldier
has been the priest will follow.
Persecutions kindle new faith and
awake fresh ardor. Pestilence
quickens charity and leads to improvements
in the condition of the
poor. Nor do we believe that it is
only in this large and general, unsympathetic,
and sweeping manner
that God allows good to be worked
out of evil. We have faith in the
intercession of the Mother of
Mercy; and as ultimate good may
arise to whole races of mankind
out of terrible calamities, so, we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_846" id="Page_846">[846]</a></span>
persuaded, there is a more intimate,
minute, and loving interference
to individual souls wherever
there is huge public calamity.
The field of battle, the burning
city, the flood, and the pestilence
are Mary’s harvest fields, whither
she sends her angels, over whom
she is queen, with special and
extraordinary graces, to gather and
collect those who might otherwise
have perished, and, in the supreme
moment which is doubtless so
often God’s hour, to win trophies
of mercy to the honor and glory of
the Precious Blood.</p>

<p>Unless we believe in God’s essential,
actual, and unintermittent
government of the world, we cannot
solve the riddle of the Sphinx,
and her cruel, stony stare will freeze
our blood as we traverse the deserts
of life. If we believe only in his
direct government, we shall find it
chiefly, if not solely, in his church;
and the area is sadly limited! If
we acknowledge his essential providence
in his permissions, if we make
sure of his presence in what appears
its very negation, then alone
do we arrive at the solution of life’s
problems; and even this, not as an
obvious thing, but as a constant
and ever-renewed act of faith in
the under-flowing gulf-stream of
divine love, which melts the ice
and softens the rigor of the wintry
epochs in the world’s history. If
we admit of this theory, which is
new to none of us, though dim to
some, we let in a flood of light upon
many of the incidents described in
the Old Testament, and specially
spoken of as done by the will of
God, but which, to our farther-advanced
revelation of God, read to
us as unlike himself. The light of
the later interpretation has been
thrown over the earlier fact; but
in the harmony of eternity, when
we are freed from the broken chord
of time, there will be no dissonant
notes.</p>

<p>There can be no more wonderful
proof of God’s unutterable love
than the way in which he has condescended
to make the very sins of
mankind work to his own glory and
to the farther revelation of himself.
From the first “<i lang="la">felix culpa</i>” of our
first parents, as the church does not
hesitate to call it, down to the present
hour&mdash;down even to the secret
depths of our own souls, where we
are conscious of the harvests of
grace sprung from repentant tears&mdash;it
is still the great alchemist turning
base metal in the crucible of
divine love into pure gold.</p>

<p>It is one of the most irrefragable
proofs of the working of a perpetual
providence that can be adduced.</p>

<p>Granted that there are no new
creations, but that creation is one
act, evolving itself by its innate
force into all the phenomena which
we see, and into countless possible
others which future generations of
beings will see, nothing of this can
prevent the fact that the moral development
of the status of mankind,
the revelations of divine
truth, and consequently of the
Deity, through the flow of ages,
has ever been a bringing of good
out of evil which no blind, irresponsible
law could produce. There is
no sort of reason why evil should
work into its contrary good, except
the reason that God is the
supreme good, and directs all apparent
evil into increments of his
glory, thereby converting it into
an ultimate good. We must remember,
however, that this does
not diminish our culpability, because
it does not affect our free-will.
It does not make evil another
form of good. It is no pact
with the devil. It is war and victory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_847" id="Page_847">[847]</a></span>
opposition and conquest. It
is justice and retribution, and it behooves
us to see whether we are
among those who are keeping ourselves
in harmony with the eternal
God in his direct government of
the world; in harmony (so far as
we know it) with his antecedent
will; or whether we are allowing
ourselves to drift away into channels
of our own, working out only
the things that he permits, but
which he also condemns, and laying
up for ourselves that swift devouring
flame which will “try every
man’s work of what sort it is.”</p>

<p class="break">We have thus arrived at two different
views of God’s government
of the world&mdash;his direct government
and his indirect or permissive
government. We now come to
what we may call his inductive
teaching of the world&mdash;the way in
which truths are partially revealed
to us, and come to us percolating
through the sands of time, as mankind
needs them and can receive
them.</p>

<p>Our Lord himself gives us an example
of this inductive process
when he speaks of “the God of
Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob”
as being “not the God of the dead,
but of the living,” thus showing
that the Jews held, and were bound
to hold, the doctrine of immortality
by an inductive process. The
teaching of the old law was symbolic
and inductive. The histories of
the Old Testament are of the same
character. They are written with
no apparent design. They are the
simple account of such incidents as
the historian thought himself bound
to record; acting, as he did, under
the divine impulse, which underlay
his statements without fettering his
pen. He was not himself half conscious
of the unspeakable importance
of his work. Consequently,
there is no effort, hardly even common
precaution and foresight, in his
mode of chronicling events. He
glances at incidents without explaining
them, because while he
wrote they were present to his own
experience, and would be to that of
his readers. A writer in our day
would allude to a person having
performed a journey of fifty miles
in an hour’s time without thinking
it necessary to explain that people
travel by steam. In another part
he would advert to railroads, and
the rapidity of locomotion as their
result, equally without a direct reference
to the individual who effected
fifty miles in an hour. To the
reader of three thousand years
hence the one incidental allusion
will explain and corroborate the
other, and thus, by internal evidence,
prove the authenticity and
consistency of the history. Unintentional
coincidences crop up as
the pages grow beneath his hand,
and to the careful student of Scripture
throw light unlooked for on
the exactitude and veracity of the
narrative. And the substratum of
the whole of the Old Testament history
is the gradual growth of one
family out of all the families of
mankind, into which, as into a carefully prepared
soil, the seed of divine
truth was to be sown. Through
all the variety of the Old Testament
writers the same underlying design
exists; and though this was a special
stream of revelation unlike any
that now exists or that is now required
(for reasons which are obvious
to every Catholic who knows
what the church is), yet they form
an indication of the way in which
the divine Creator is for ever governing
the world and preparing it
with a divine foresight for his ultimate
purpose. The Holy Ghost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_848" id="Page_848">[848]</a></span>
speaks now through a direct organ,
which organ is the church. Formerly
God spoke through historic
events and multitudinous incidents
in connection with one race of people.
But this very fact authorizes
us to believe that the same <em>character</em>
of government exists throughout
the whole universe in a greater or
less degree, and that God is preparing
the way for the ultimate triumph
of the sacred Humanity and of his
spouse the Church, on the far-off
shores of sultry Africa, in the inner
recesses of silent China, among
the huge forests which skirt the
Blue Mountains, or amid the glittering
glories of the kingdoms of
ice.</p>

<p>There is nothing more depressingly
sad, more deeply to be regretted,
and more difficult to explain
than the almost hopeless narrowness
of most people in their appreciation
of divinely-ordained facts.
We live like moles. We throw up
a mound of dusky earth above and
around us, within which we grope
and are content. The treasures of
sacred lore, the depths of spiritual
science, the infinite variety of
Scriptural information, with the
divinely-pointed moral of every
tale, are things which most of us
are content to know exist, and
to think no more about. The very
lavishness with which God has
given us all that we want for the
salvation of our souls seems to
have stifled in our ungenerous natures
the longing to know and to
do more. When the Evangelist
said that the world would not hold
the books that might be written on
the sacred Humanity alone, he must
have had an intuition, not so much
of the material world and material
volumes, as of the world of narrowed
minds and crippled hearts
who would be found stranded on
the shores of our much-vaunted
civilization and progress.</p>

<p>Few things are more remarkable
in the tone and character of modern
Catholic writers than the small
amount of use they make of Scripture:
so strangely in contrast with
the old writers, and with even the
great French spiritual authors of a
century and a half ago. Their
pages are rich with Scriptural lore.
Their style is a constant recognition
of the government and designs
of God as shown to us in
our past and present, and as we
are bound to anticipate them in
the future. In our time this has
given place to emotional devotion;
a most excellent thing in its way,
but only likely to have much influence
over our lives when it is
grounded on solid theology and
directed by real knowledge. No
doubt it is so in the minds of the
authors themselves; but we fear
it is rare in those of their ordinary
readers, who thus drink the froth
off the wine, but are not benefited
by the strengthening properties of
the generous liquid itself. Nor
will they be until they have made
up their minds to believe and understand
that conversion is not an
isolated fact in their lives, but a
progressive act involving all the
intellect, all the faculties, be they
great or small (for each one must
be full up to his capacity), and all
the heart, mind, and soul. The
whole man must work and be worked
upon in harmony; and we
must remember that it <em>is</em> work, and
not merely feeling, consolation,
emotion, prettiness, and ornament,
but an intellectual growth, going
on <i lang="la">pari passu</i> with a spiritual
growth, until the whole vessel is
fitted and prepared for the glory
of God.</p>

<p>We think we may venture to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_849" id="Page_849">[849]</a></span>
that few things will conduce more
to this than the study of the
divine Scriptures under the light
and teaching of the Catholic Church.
In them we find a profound revelation
of the character of God.
We are, as we read them interpreted
to us by the lamp of the sanctuary,
let down into awful depths
of the divine Eternal Mind. We
watch the whole world and all
creation working up for the supreme
moment of the birth of
Jesus; while in the life of our
Blessed Lord himself we find, condensed
into those wonderful thirty-three
years, the whole system of the
church&mdash;the spiritual fabric which
is to fill eternity, the one God-revealing
system which is finally to
supersede all others.</p>

<p>Unhappily many persons are
under the delusion that narrowness
and ignorance are the same as
Christian simplicity, and that innocence
means ignorance of everything
else, as well as of evil. These
are the people who are afraid to
look facts in the face, and to read
them off as part of the God-directed
history of the world. These are
they to whom science is a bugbear.
They hug their ignorance as being
their great safeguard, and wear
blinkers lest they should be startled
by the events which cross their
path. Grown men and women do
it for themselves and attempt it for
their children, and meanwhile those
to whom we ought to be superior
are rushing on with headlong daring,
carrying intellectual eminence,
and originality, and investigation of
science, all before them; while we,
who should be clad in the panoply
of the faith, and afraid of nothing,
are putting out the candles and
shading the lamps, that we may idly
enjoy a shadow too dense for real
work.</p>

<p>And yet is not the earth ours?
Is not all that exists our heritage?
To whom does anything belong if
not to us, the sons of the church,
the sole possessors of infallible
truth, the only invulnerable ones,
the only ever-enduring and ever-increasing
children of the light?
The past is ours; the present
should be ours; the future is all our
own. Our triumph may be slow
(and it is slower because we are
cowards), but it is certain. Are
we not tenfold the children of the
covenant, the sons of the Father’s
house, the heirs of all? We alone
are in possession of what all science
and art must ultimately fall back
upon and harmonize with. There
is no success possible but what is
obtained, and shall in the future be
obtained, in union with the church
of God. Have we forgotten, are
we ever for a moment permitted to
forget, that the church of God is
not an accident, nor a cunningly-devised,
tolerably able, partially
infirm organization, but that she is
the spouse of the God-Man, the one
revelation of God, perfect and entire,
though but gradually given
forth; that all the harmonies of
science are fragments of the harmony
of God himself, of his pure
being, of the <i lang="la">Qui Est</i>; and that
the harmony of the arts is simply
the human expression of the harmony
of the <i lang="el">Logos</i>, the human
utterances of the articulations of
the divine Word, as they come to
us in our far-off life-like echoes
from eternity?</p>

<p>Even the great false religions of
the past, and of the present in the
remote East, are but man’s discord
breaking the harmony of truth
while retaining the key-note: the
immortality of the soul and the
perfection of a future state in the
deep thoughts of Egypt, the universality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_850" id="Page_850">[850]</a></span>
of God’s providential government
of the world in Greek
mythology, the union of the soul
with God in Brahminism, and the
One God of Mahometanism. Each
has its kernel of truth, its ideal
nucleus of supernatural belief,
which it had caught from the great
harmony of God in broken fragments,
and enshrined in mystic
signs. Even now, as we look back
upon them all, we are bound to
confess that they stand on a totally
different ground from the multitudinous
sects of our day, which
break off from the one body of the
church and drift off into negation
or Protestantism. Far be it from
us to insinuate that any, the lowest
form of Christianity, the weakest
utterance of the dear name of Jesus,
is not ten thousand fold better than
the most abstruse of the old Indian
or Egyptian religions. Wherever
the name of Jesus is uttered, no
matter how imperfectly, there is
more hope of light and of salvation
than in the deepest symbols of
heathen or pagan creeds. It may
be but one ray of light, but still it
is light&mdash;the real warming, invigorating
light of the sun, and not the
cold and deleterious light of the
beautiful moon, who has poisoned
what she has borrowed.<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> Nevertheless,
and maintaining this with
all the energy of which we are capable,
it is still true that each one
of the great false religions, which at
various times and in divers places
have swayed mankind, was rather
the overgrowth of error on a substantial
truth than the breaking up
of truth into fragmentary and illogical
negation, which is the characteristic
of all forms of secession
from the Catholic unity of the
church. The modern aberrations
from the faith are a mere jangle of
sounds, while the old creeds were
the petrifaction of truth. The
modern forms of faith outside the
church are a negation of truth
rather than a distortion. Consequently,
they are for ever drifting
and taking Protean shapes that
defy classification.</p>

<p>They have broken up into a hundred
forms; they will break up into
a thousand more, till the whole fabric
has crumbled into dust. They
have none of the strong hold on
human nature which the old religions
had, because they are not the
embodiment of a sacred mystery,
but rather the explaining away of
all mystery. They are a perpetual
drifting detritus, without coherence
as without consistency; and as
they slip down the slant of time,
they fall into the abyss of oblivion,
and will leave not a trace behind,
only in so far that, vanishing from
sight, they make way for the fuller
establishment of the truth&mdash;the eternal,
the divine, spherical truth,
absolute in its cohesion and perfect
in all its parts.</p>

<p>The hold which heathen and pagan
creeds have had upon mankind
conveys a lesson to ourselves which
superficial thinkers are apt to overlook.
It is certain they could not
have held whole nations beneath
their influence had not each in
its turn been an embodiment of
some essential truth which, though
expressed through error, remains in
itself essentially a part of truth.
They snatched at fragments of the
natural law which governs the universe,
or they embodied in present
expression the inalienable hopes
of mankind. They took the world
of nature as the utterance neither
of a passing nor of an inexorable
law, but of an inscrutable Being,
and believed that the mystical underlies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_851" id="Page_851">[851]</a></span>
the natural. Untaught by
the sweet revelations of Christianity,
their religion could assume no
aspect but one of terror, silent
dread, and deep horror. Their
only escape from this result was in
the deterioration that necessarily
follows the popularization of all
abstract ideas, unless protected by
a system at once consistent and
elastic, like that which is exhibited in
the discipline of the Catholic Church.
They wearied of the rarefied atmosphere
of unexplained mystery.
They wanted the tangible and evident
in its place. Like the Israelites,
they lusted after the flesh-pots
of Egypt; and their lower nature
and evil passions rebelled against
the moral loftiness of abstract
truth. The multitude could not
be kept up to the mark, and needed
coarser food. The result was
inevitable. But as all religion involves
mystery, instead of working
upward through the natural law to
the spiritual and divine law, they
inverted the process, and grovelled
down below the natural law, with
its sacramentalistic character, to
the preternatural and diabolic.
Mystery was retained, but only in
the profanation of themselves and
of natural laws, until they had passed
outside all nature, and, making a
hideous travesty of humanity, had
become more vile and hateful than
the devils they served.</p>

<p>Thus the Romans vulgarized the
Greek mythology; and that which
had remained during a long period
as a beautiful though purely human
expression of a divine mystery,
among a people whose religion consisted
mainly in the worship of
the beautiful, and who themselves
transcended all that humanity has
ever since beheld in their own
personal perfection of beauty, became,
when it passed through the
coarser hands of the Romans, a degenerate
vulgarity, which infected
their whole existence, in art and
in manners, quite as effectually as
in religion. Then Rome flung
open her gates to all the creeds of
all the world, and the time-honored
embodiments of fragmentary but
intrinsic truth met together, and
were all equally tolerated and
equally degenerated. All!&mdash;except
the one whole and perfect
truth: the Gospel of Salvation.
That was never tolerated. That
alone could not be endured, because
the instinct of evil foresaw
its own impending ruin in the Gospel
of peace.</p>

<p>It was a new thing for mankind to
be told that a part of the essence of
religion was elevated morality and
the destruction of sin in the individual.
Whatever comparative purity
of life had co-existed with the old
religions was hardly due to their
influence among the multitude,
though it might be so with those
whose educated superiority enabled
them to reason out the morality of
creeds. While the rare philosopher
was reading the inmost secret of the
abstract idea on which the religion
of his country was based, and the
common pagan was practising the
most degraded sorcery and peering
into obscene mysteries, without a
single elevation of thought, suddenly
the life of the God-Man was put
before the world, and the whole
face of creation was gradually
changed.</p>

<p>But as the shadows of the past
in the old religions led up to the
light, so shall the light of the
present lead up to the “perfect
day.”</p>

<h3>SEARCH FOR OLD LACE IN VENICE.</h3>

<p>One is almost ashamed to mention
Venice now, or any other of those
thousand-and-one bournes of hackneyed
travel and staples of hackneyed
books. There is probably no one
claiming a place in a civilized community
who does not know Venice
almost as well as do her own children,
and who could not discourse
intelligently of the Bridge of Sighs,
the Doge’s Palace, and the Rialto
Bridge, of St. Mark’s and the brazen
horses. Still, when one has read
multitudinous poems about gondolas
and gondoliers, and any amount
of descriptions of the Grand Canal,
with its palaces of various styles of
architecture, and some few dramas
about the grand and gloomy, the
secret and awful, doings of ancient
Venetian life, even then there are
nooks in the place and incidents in
the doings which escape notice. A
traveller arriving at Venice is hardly
surprised at the water-street, with
which pictures have already made
him familiar, but the mode of entering
a covered gondola&mdash;crab-fashion&mdash;is
not so familiar, and he generally
butts his head against the low ceiling,
eliciting a laugh from his gondolier
and the good-humored bystanders,
before he learns the native
and proper way of backing into his
seat. So, too, in rowing slowly and
dreamily about from church to
church, full of artistic marvels or
wonderful historical monuments, he
feels to a certain degree at home.
He has seen all this before; the
present is but a dream realized.
But there are now and then unexpected
sights&mdash;though, it must be
confessed, not many&mdash;and of course
such are the most interesting, even
if they are by no means on a level
with those more famous and more
beautiful.</p>

<p>From Venice to Vicenza is but
a short distance by rail, and Vicenza
boasts of Roman ruins, and mediæval
churches, and a Palladian theatre;
but on our day’s trip there, in
early spring, we certainly dwelt
more on the aspect of the woods
and plains, with their faint veil of
yellow green already beginning to
appear, the few flowers in the <i lang="it">osteria</i>
garden, and the box hedges and
aloes in the cemetery. The beauty
of the Venetian and Lombard plains
lies more in their mere freshness
than in their diversity; it is entirely a
beauty of detail, a beauty fit for
the minuteness of Preraphaelite art
rather than for the sweeping brush
of the great masters of conventional
landscape painting. But coming
from Venice every trace of verdure
was grateful to the eye, and we felt as
one who, having been confined in a
beautiful, spacious room, filled with
treasures and scented with subtle
perfume, might feel on coming suddenly
into the fresh air of a prairie.
By contrast, the suggestion of
fresh air and open space draws us
at once to our subject&mdash;a search after
old lace in one of the cities
known to possess many treasures in
that line.</p>

<p>Like all other industries in Venice,
the sale of lace thrives chiefly
on the fancy of the foreign visitors.
The natives are generally
too poor to buy much of it, and, indeed,
much of what is in the market
is the product of forced sacrifices
made by noble but impoverished
families of Venetian origin. It is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_853" id="Page_853">[853]</a></span>
sad thing to see the spoils of Italy
still scattered over the world, as if
the same fate had pursued her, with
a few glorious intervals of triumph
and possession, ever since the barbarian
ancestors of her <i lang="it">forestieri</i>
rifled her treasure-houses under the
banners of Celtic, Cimbrian, and
Gothic chieftains. What Brennus,
Alaric, and Genseric began the
Constable of Bourbon and the great
Napoleon continued by force; but
what is still sadder is to see the
daily disintegration of other treasure-houses
whose contents are unwillingly
but necessarily bartered
away to rich Englishmen, Americans,
and Russians. Pictures, jewelry,
lace, goldsmith’s work, artistic
trifles&mdash;precious through their material
and history, but more so through
the family associations which have
made them heirlooms&mdash;too often
pass from the sleepy, denuded, dilapidated,
but still beautiful Italian
palace to the cabinet or gallery or
museum of the lucky foreign connoisseur,
or even&mdash;a worse fate&mdash;into
the hands of men to whom possession
is much, but appreciation
very little.</p>

<p>While at Venice we were so
lazy as never to go sight-seeing,
which accounts for the fact that
we missed many a thing which
visitors of a few days see and talk
learnedly about; and if the business
activity of an old lace-seller had
not brought her to the hotel, our
search after lace might never have
been made. She brought fine
specimens with her, but her prices
were rather high, and, after admiring
the lace, she was dismissed
without getting any orders. But
she came again, and this time left
her address. We wanted some lace
for a present, and fancied that the
proverbial facility for taking anything
rather than nothing, which
distinguishes the Italian seller of
curiosities, would induce her to
strike some more favorable bargain
in her own house, where no other
customer would be at hand to treasure
up her weakness as a precedent.</p>

<p>It was not easy to find the house.
Many intricate little canals had to
be traversed (for on foot we should
probably have lost our way over
and over again); and as we passed,
many a quaint court, many a delicate
window, many a sombre archway,
and as often the objects which
we, perhaps too conventionally,
call picturesque&mdash;such as the tattered
clothes drying on long lines
stretched from window to window;
heaps of refuse piled up against
princely gateways; rotten posts
standing up out of the water, with
the remnants of the last coat of
paint they ever had, a hundred years
ago; gaudy little shrines calculated
to make a Venetian <i lang="it">popolana</i> feel
very pious and an “unregenerate”
artist well-nigh frantic&mdash;met our
sight. At last the house was reached,
or at least the narrow quay from
which a <i lang="it">calle</i>, or tiny, dark street,
plunged away into regions unknown
but inviting. Our gondolier was
wise in the street-labyrinth lore of
his old city, and up some curious outside
stairs, and then again by innumerable
inside ones, we reached the
old woman’s rooms. Of these there
were two&mdash;at least, we saw no more.
Both were poor and bare, and the
old lace seller was wrinkled, unclean,
good-humored, and eager.
She talked volubly, not being obliged
to use a foreign tongue to help
herself out, but going on with her
soft, gliding, but quick Venetian
tones. Travelling in Italy and coming
in contact with all classes of
the people is apt sadly to take
down one’s scholarly conceit in
knowing the language of Dante<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_854" id="Page_854">[854]</a></span>
and Petrarch; for all the classicism
of one’s school-days goes for very
little in bargaining for lace, giving
orders in a shop or market, or trying
not to let boat-and-donkey-men
cheat you to your face. There is this
comfort: that if you often cannot
understand the people, they
can almost invariably understand
you (unless your accent be altogether
outrageous), which saves John
Bull and his American cousin the
ignominy of being brought an umbrella
when they have asked for
mushrooms, and actually taken the
trouble to give a diagram of that
vegetable.</p>

<p>The prices were kept so obstinately
above our means that all purchase
of lace was impossible; but
the old woman was untiring in displaying
her stores of antique treasures,
and we felt sufficiently rewarded
for our expedition. She
herself was worth a visit; for, like
many ancient Italian matrons, and
not a few nearer home, she was one
of that generation of models whom
you would have sworn has endured
from the days of Titian and Vandyke,
immortally old and unchangeably
wrinkled. You see such faces
in the galleries, with the simple
title “Head of an old man”&mdash;or old
woman, as the case may be&mdash;attributed
to some famous painter; and
these weird portraits attract you
far more than the youth, and beauty,
and health, and prosperity of
the Duchess of Este, the baker’s
handsome daughter, or the gorgeous
Eastern sibyl. Again, you do not
care to have any allegorical meaning
tacked on to that intensely human
face; you would be disgusted if
you found it set down in the catalogue
as “a Parca,” a magician, or
a witch. You seem to know it,
to remember one which was like it,
to connect it with many human vicissitudes
and common, though not
the less pathetic, troubles. She is
probably poor and has been hard-working;
wifehood and motherhood
have been stern realities to her, instead
of poems lived in luxurious
houses and earthly plenty; her
youth’s romance was probably
short, fervid, passionate, but soon
lapsed into the dreary struggle
of the poor for bare life. Chance
and old age have made her look
hard, though in truth her heart
would melt at a tender love-tale
like that of a girl of fifteen, and
her brave, bright nature belies the
lines on her face. Just as women
live this kind of life nowadays, so
they did three and five hundred
years ago; so did probably those
very models immortalized by great
painters; so did others long before
art had reached the possibility of
truthful portraiture.</p>

<p>Our old friend the lace-seller,
though she has given occasion for
this rambling digression, did not,
however, at the time, suggest all
these things to our mind.</p>

<p>If she herself was a type of certain
models of the old masters, her
wares were also a reminder of
famous people, scenes, and places
of Venice. They were all of one
kind, all of native manufacture,
and, of course, all made by hand.
In a certain degenerate fashion this
industry is still continued, but the
specimens of modern work which
we saw were coarse and valueless
in comparison with those of the
old. There were collars and cuffs
in abundance, such as both men
and women wore&mdash;large, broad,
Vandyked collars like those one
sees in Venetian pictures; flounces,
or rather straight bands of divers
widths, from five to twenty inches,
which had more probably belonged
to albs and cottas. They suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_855" id="Page_855">[855]</a></span>
rich churches and gorgeous
ceremonial in a time when nobles
and people were equally devoted
to splendid shows, prosperity and
loftiness, and a picturesque blending
of the religious and the imperial.
Chasubles stiff with gems and
altars of precious stones seem to harmonize
well with these priceless veils,
woven over with strange, hieroglyphic-looking,
conventional, yet beautiful
forms; intricate with tracery
which, put into stone, would immortalize
a sculptor; full of knots, each
of which is a miniature masterpiece
of embroidery; and the whole
the evident product of an artist’s
brain. This lace has not the gossamer-like
beauty of Brussels. It is
thick and close in its texture, and
is of that kind which looks best on
dark velvets and heavy, dusky
cloths&mdash;just what one would fancy
the grave Venetian signiors wearing
on state occasions. It matches
somehow with the antique XVth and
XVIth century jewelry&mdash;the magnificent,
artistic, heavy collars of
the great orders of chivalry; it has
something solid, substantial, and
splendid about it. Such lace used
to be sold to kings and senators,
not by a paltry yard measure, but
by at least twice its weight in gold;
for the price was “as many gold
pieces as would cover the quantity
of lace required.” Now, although
this princely mode of barter is out
of fashion, old Venetian “point”
is still one of the costliest luxuries
in the world, and the rich foreigners
who visit Venice usually carry
away at least as much as will border
a handkerchief or trim a cap, as a
memento of the beautiful and once
imperial city of the Adriatic. The
modern lace&mdash;one can scarcely call
it <em>imitation</em>, any more than Salviati’s
modern Venetian glass and
mosaic can be so called&mdash;seems
to be deficient in the beauty and
intricacy of design of the old specimens;
it is so little sought after
that the industry stands a chance
of dying out, at least until after the
old stock is exhausted and necessity
drives the lace-makers to ply
their art more delicately.</p>

<p>Some modern lace, the English
Honiton and some of the Irish lace,
is quite as perfect and beautiful,
and very nearly as costly, as the
undoubted specimens the history
of which can be traced back for
two or three hundred years. But
from what we saw of Venetian
point, the new has sadly degenerated
from the old, and exact copying
of a few antique models would be
no detriment to the modern productions.
To the unlearned eye
there is no difference between Venetian
glass three or four hundred
years old, carefully preserved in a
national museum, and the manufactures
of last month, sold in Salviati’s
warerooms in Venice and
his shop in London. Connoisseurs
say they <em>do</em> detect some inferiority
in the modern work; but as to the
lace, even the veriest tyro in such
lore can see the rough, tasteless,
coarse appearance of the new
when contrasted with the old.</p>

<h3>NEW PUBLICATIONS.</h3>

<div class="hanging">

<p><span class="smcap">Supposed Miracles: An Argument for
the Honor of Christianity against
Superstition, and for its Truth
against Unbelief.</span> By Rev. J. M.
Buckley. New York: Hurd &amp; Houghton.
1875.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Buckley is a Methodist minister,
who seems to be a sensible, honest, and
straightforward person, strong in his convictions,
ardently religious, and yet abhorring
the excesses of credulity and irrational
enthusiasm. The substance of
his pamphlet was delivered by him as
an address before a meeting of Methodist
ministers, and is principally directed
against some pretences to miraculous
powers and wonderful cure-working within
his own denomination. So far as this
goes, his effort is quite successful, particularly
in regard to a certain Rev. Mr.
Platt, who professes to have been cured
of an obstinate infirmity by the prayers,
accompanied by the imposition of hands,
of a lady by the name of Miss Mossman.
His particular object led him, however,
to advance some general propositions respecting
real and supposititious miracles,
and to sustain these by arguments and
appeals to so-called facts, real or assumed,
having a much wider range and application
than is embraced by his special
and immediate purpose. As an <i lang="la">argumentum
ad hominem</i>, his plea may have been
quite sufficient and convincing to his
particular audience; but as addressed
to a wider circle in the form of a published
pamphlet, it appears to be somewhat
deficient in the quality and quantity
of the proofs alleged in support of its
great amplitude and confidence of assertion.
It is also defective in respect to
the definition and division of the subject-matter.
To begin with his definition of
miracle: “A true miracle is an event
which involves the setting aside or contradiction
of the established and uniform
relations of antecedents and consequents;
such event being produced at the will
of an agent not working in the way of
physical cause and effect, for the purpose
of demonstration, or punishment, or deliverance.”
This definition errs by excess
and defect&mdash;by excess, in including
the scope or end as a part of the essence;
by defect, in excluding effects produced
by an act of divine power which is above
all established and uniform relations of
antecedents and consequents. This last
fault is not of much practical importance
in respect to the question of the
miracles by which a divine revelation is
proved, or of ecclesiastical miracles; because
those which are simply above nature,
called by S. Thomas miracles of the
first order&mdash;as the Incarnation and the glorification
of the body of Christ&mdash;are very
few in number, and are more objects than
evidences of faith. The first error, however,
confuses the subject, and opens the
way to a summary rejection of evidence
for particular miracles on the <i lang="la">à priori</i>
ground that they have not that scope which
has been defined by the author as necessary
to a true miracle. It is evident that God
cannot give supernatural power to perform
works whose end is bad or which
are simply useless. But we cannot determine
precisely what end is sufficient,
in the view of God, for enabling a person
to work a miracle, except so far as we
learn this by induction and the evidence
of facts which are proved. Mr. Buckley
affirms positively that the end of miracles
was solely the authentication of the
divine legation of Christ and his forerunners
in the mission of making known
the divine revelation. Consequently
from this assumption, he asserts that
miracles ceased very early in the history
of Christianity. He also professes to
have “shown, by the proof of facts, that
miracles have ceased. If the great Reformation
in Germany, Switzerland, and
Scotland, if Methodism, had no miracles;
if the missionaries of the Cross [<i>i.e.</i>, Protestant]
are powerless to work them; and
if the best men and women of all branches
of the [Protestant] church are without
this power, then indeed must they have
ceased.” No one will dispute the logical
sequence or material truth of this
conclusion, so far as it does not extend
beyond its own premises. He has made
it, however, a general conclusion, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_857" id="Page_857">[857]</a></span>
promises to prove it by “conclusive and
irresistible proof.” He is therefore bound
to prove that miracles had ceased from
an early epoch in the universal church,
including the whole period before the
XVIth century, and in respect to all
Christian bodies except Protestants from
that time to the present. In respect to
the former period, his whole proof consists
in a statement that no person of
candor and judgment who has read the
ante-Nicene fathers will conclude it
probable that miracles continued much
beyond the beginning of the IId century,
and in the assertion “that they have
ceased we have proved to a demonstration.”
In respect to supposed miracles
during the latter period in the Catholic
Church, the proof that none of them are
true miracles is contained in the statement
that “the opinion of the Protestant
world is settled” on that head. Very
good, Mr. Buckley! Such logical
accuracy, united with the intuitive insight
of genius, is a conclusive proof that the
“assistances which our age enjoys”
have amazingly shortened and simplified
the tedious processes by which “that
indigested heap and fry of authors which
they call antiquity” were obliged to
investigate truth and acquire knowledge.
The reverend gentleman tells us that
“I have for some years past been reading,
as I have found leisure, that magnificent
translation of the ante-Nicene fathers
published by T. &amp; T. Clark, of Edinburgh,
in about twenty five volumes.
To say that I have been astonished is to
speak feebly.” Probably the astonishment
of Origen, Justin Martyr, and
Irenæus would be no less, and would
be more forcibly expressed, if they could
resume their earthly life and peruse the
remarkable address before us. If its
author will read the account of the miracles
of SS. Gervasius and Protasius given
by S. Ambrose, the <cite>City of God</cite> of S. Augustine,
the <cite>Ecclesiastical History</cite> of Ven. Bede,
and Dr. Newman’s <cite>Essay on Ecclesiastical
Miracles</cite>, we can promise him that he
will experience a still greater degree of
astonishment than he did on the perusal
of the ante-Nicene fathers. Mr. Buckley
appears to be in <i lang="la">bona fide</i>, and is
probably a much better man than many
whose knowledge is more extensive.
The hallucination of mind which produces
in him the belief that he stands on
a higher intellectual plane than Clement
of Alexandria and Cyprian in ancient
times, or Petavius, Kleutgen, Bayma,
and “Jesuits” in general, is so simply
astounding, and the credulity requisite
to a firm assent to his own statements as
“demonstrations” is so much beyond
that which was, in the olden time, shown
by believing in the “phœnix,” that he
must be sincere, though very much in
need of information. We cannot help
feeling that he is worthy of knowing
better, and would be convinced of the
truth if it were set before him fairly.
It is plain that he has no knowledge of
the evidence which exists of a series of
miracles wrought in the Catholic Church
continuously from the times of the apostles
to our own day, and which cannot
be rejected without subverting the evidence
on which the truth of all miracles
whatsoever is based. The number of
these which are considered by prudent
Catholic writers to be quite certain or
probable is beyond reckoning, though
still very small in comparison with ordinary
events and the experiences of the
whole number of Catholics in all ages.
Those of the most extraordinary magnitude
are relatively much fewer in number
than those which are less wonderful,
as, for instance, the raising of the dead to
life. Nevertheless, there are instances
of this kind&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, those related of S.
Dominic, S. Bernard, S. Teresa, and S.
Francis Xavier&mdash;which, to say the least,
have a <i lang="la">primâ facie</i> probability. One of
another kind is the perpetually-recurring
miracle of the liquefaction of the blood
of S. Januarius. The miraculous and
complete cure of Mrs. Mattingly, of Washington,
is an instance which occurred in
our own country, and which, among many
other intelligent Protestants, John C.
Calhoun considered as most undoubtedly
effected by miraculous agency. We
mention one more only&mdash;the restoration
of the destroyed vision of one eye by
the application of the water of Lourdes,
in the case of Bourriette, as related by
M. Lasserre. We are rather more cautious
in professing to have demonstrated
the continuance of miracles than our
reverend friend has been in respect to
the contrary. We profess merely to show
that his demonstration requires a serious
refutation of the arguments in favor of
the proposition he denies, and to bring
forward some considerations in proof of
the title which these arguments have to
a respectful and candid examination.
Moreover, though we cannot pretend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_858" id="Page_858">[858]</a></span>
to prove anything, <i lang="la">hic et nunc</i>, by conclusive
evidence and reasoning, we
refer to the articles on the miracle of
S. Januarius, and to the translation of
M. Lasserre’s book, in our own pages,
as containing evidence for two of the
instances alluded to, and to the works
of Bishop England for the evidence in
Mrs. Mattingly’s case.</p>

<p>Besides those supernatural effects or
events which can only be produced by a
divine power acting immediately on the
subject, there are other marvellous effects
which in themselves require only a
supermundane power, and are merely preternatural,
using nature in the sense
which excludes all beyond our own
world and our human nature. Other
unusual events, again, may appear to be
preternatural, but may be proved, or
reasonably conjectured, to proceed from
a merely natural cause. Here is a debatable
land, where the truth is attainable
with more difficulty, generally with
less certainty, and where there is abundant
chance for unreasonable credulity
and equally unreasonable scepticism to
lose their way in opposite directions.
Mr. Buckley summarily refers all the
strange phenomena to be found among
pagan religions to jugglery and fanaticism.
Spiritism he dismisses without a
word of comment, implying that he considers
it to be in no sense preternatural.
We differ from him in opinion in respect
to this point also. We have no doubt
that many alleged instances of preternatural
events are to be explained by
natural causes, and many others by jugglery
and imposture. We cannot, for
ourselves, find a reasonable explanation
of a certain number of well-proved facts
in regard to both paganism and spiritism,
except on the hypothesis of preternatural
agency. The nature of that
agency cannot be determined without recurring
to theological science. Catholic
theology determines such cases by referring
them to the agency of demons.
Mr. Buckley is afraid to admit that the
alleged “miracles were real and wrought
by devils.” “If so,” he continues, “we
may ask, in the language of Job, Where
and what is God?” We answer to this
that God does not permit demons to deceive
men to such an extent as to cause
the ruin of their souls, except through
their own wilful and culpable submission
to these deceits. It makes no difference
whether the delusion produced is
referred to jugglery or demonology in
respect to this particular question.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Formation of Christendom.</span>
Part Third. By T. W. Allies. London:
Longmans &amp; Co. 1875.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Allies dedicates this volume, in very
beautiful and appropriate terms, to Dr.
Newman, who, he says in classic and
graceful phrase, having once been “the
Hector of a doomed Troy,” is now “the
Achilles of the city of God.” The particular
topic of the book is the relation
of Greek philosophy to the Christian
church. A remarkable chapter on the
foundation of the Roman Church, in
which great use is made of the discoveries
of archæologists, precedes the treatment
of the Neostoic, Neopythagorean,
and Neoplatonic schools, with cognate
topics. One of the most interesting and
novel chapters is that on Apollonius of
Tyana, whose wonderful life, as related
by Philostratus, the author regards as a
philosophic and anti-Christian myth invented
by the above-mentioned pagan
writer, with only a slight basis of historical
truth. Mr. Allies has studied the
deep, thoughtful works of those German
authors who give a truly intelligent and
connected history of philosophy, and his
work is a valuable contribution to that
branch of science, as well as to the history
of Christianity. One of the most
irresistible proofs of the divine mission
and divine personality of Jesus Christ
lies in the blending of the elements of
Hellenic genius and culture, Jewish
faith, and Roman law into a new composite,
by a new form, when he founded his
universal kingdom. A mere man, by
his own natural power, and under the
circumstances in which he lived, could
not have conceived such an idea, much
less have carried it into execution. The
most ineffably stupid, as well as atrociously
wicked, of all impostors and
philosophical charlatans are those apostate
Christians who strive to drag Christianity
down to the level of the pagan
systems of religion and philosophy, and
reduce it to a mere natural phenomenon.
Mr. Allies shows this in a work which
combines erudition with a grace of style
formed on classic models, and an enlightened,
fervent Catholic spirit, imbibed
from the fathers and doctors of the
church. At a time when the popular
philosophy is decked in false hair and
mock-jewels, as a stage-queen, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_859" id="Page_859">[859]</a></span>
cheering to find here and there a votary
of that genuine philosophy whose beauty
is native and real, and who willingly
proclaims her own subjection and inferiority
by humbly saying, <i lang="la">Ecce ancilla
Domini</i>.</p>

Review.</span> Vol. I. No. 1. January,
1876. Philadelphia: Hardy &amp; Mahony.</p>

</div>

<p>A very large number of the most highly
gifted and learned Catholics throughout
Christendom, both clergymen and laymen,
are at present employed in writing for
the reviews of various classes which have
existed for a greater or lesser period of
time within the present century. Much
of the very best literature of the age is to
be found in their articles, and a very considerable
part of this is of permanent
value. In solid merit of matter and style,
and in adaptation to the wants of the time,
the best of these periodicals have improved
steadily, and we may say of some
of them that they hardly admit of any
farther progress. The advantage of such
periodicals is not only very great for their
readers, but almost equally so for those
who are engaged in contributing to their
contents. The effort and practice of writing
constantly for the public react upon
the writers. Each one is encouraged and
instructed in the most useful and effective
method of directing his studies and giving
verbal expression to their results, so
as to attain the practical end he has in
view&mdash;that of disseminating and diffusing
knowledge over as wide an extent as possible.
The combination of various writers,
each having one or more specialties,
under a competent editorial direction
secures variety and versatility without
prejudice to unity, and corrects the excesses
or defects of individuality without
checking originality, thus giving to the
resulting work in some respects a superiority
over that which is the product of
one single mind, unless that mind possesses
the gifts and acquisitions in <i lang="la">modo
eminenti</i> which are usually found divided
among a number of different persons. To
conduct a review alone is a herculean
task, and Dr. Brownson has accomplished
a work which is really astonishing in
maintaining, almost by unaided effort,
through so many years, a periodical of
the high rank accorded by common consent
to the one which bore his name and
will be his perpetual monument. That,
at the present juncture, a new review is
necessary and has a fine field open before
it; that in its management ecclesiastical
direction and episcopal control are requisite
for adequate security and weight with
the Catholic public; and that full opportunity
for efficient co-operation on the
part of laymen of talent and education is
most desirable, cannot admit of a moment’s
doubt. It is therefore a matter of
heart-felt congratulation that the favorable
moment has been so promptly seized
and the vacant place so quickly occupied
by the gentlemen who have undertaken
the editing and the publishing of the
<cite>American Catholic Quarterly</cite>. It is probably
known to most, if not all, of our readers
that the editors are Dr. Corcoran, professor
in the Ecclesiastical Seminary of
Philadelphia; Dr. O’Connor, the rector
of that institution; and Mr. Wolff, who
has long and ably edited the Philadelphia
<cite>Catholic Standard</cite>. It would be difficult to
find in the United States an equally competent
triad. The publishers, who have
already the experience acquired by the
management of a literary magazine and
a newspaper, will, we may reasonably
hope, be able to sustain the financial burden
of this greater undertaking in a successful
manner, if they receive the support
which they have a right to expect,
by means of their subscription list. The
first number of the new review presents
a typographical face which is quite peculiar
to itself and decidedly attractive.
Its contents, besides articles from each
of the editors, are composed of contributions
from three clergymen and two laymen,
embracing a considerable variety of
topics. The clerical contributors are the
Right Reverend Bishops Lynch and Becker,
and the Rev. Drs. Corcoran, O’Connor,
and McGlynn. The lay contributors
are Dr. Brownson, John Gilmary Shea,
and Mr. Wolff. The names of F. Thébaud,
Dr. Marshall, and General Gibbon
are among those announced for the next
number. We extend a cordial greeting
with our best wishes to the <cite>American
Catholic Quarterly Review</cite>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Manual of Catholic Indian Missionary
Associations.</span></p>

</div>

<p>The Indian question continues to be
one of the most troublesome in our national
politics. Its only real solution&mdash;and
we believe this to be President Grant’s
opinion&mdash;is to Christianize the Indians.
The task is undoubtedly a hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_860" id="Page_860">[860]</a></span>
one, but it would be far less so if wolves
in sheep’s clothing had not been sent
among them. The only successful attempt
at civilizing the Indians has been
made by Catholic missionaries. But
under the administration of the Indian
Bureau, the utter rottenness of which has
been so recently exposed, missions and
reservations have been thrown to this religious
agency and that without the
slightest regard for the wishes of those
who, it is to be supposed, were most to
be benefited by the operation&mdash;the Indians
themselves. In this way flourishing
Catholic missions were turned over to the
Methodist or other denominations, and
the representations of the missionaries,
as well as of the chiefs and tribes themselves,
were of no avail whatever to alter
so iniquitous a proceeding. This little
manual gives a brief sketch of the status
of Catholic Indians and working of the
Bureau of Indian Missions. It contains
also an earnest appeal to the Catholic ladies
of the United States from the “Ladies’
Catholic Indian Missionary Association
of Washington, D. C.,” urging contributions
and the formation of similar associations
throughout the country to aid
in sustaining the Catholic Indian missions.</p>

<h3>A CORRECTION.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">To the Editor of The Catholic
World</span>:</p>

<p>I have just received, through the Catholic
Publication Society, the following
card from Mr. Gladstone:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Gladstone desires to send with his
compliments his thanks to the Society
for a copy, which he has received, of Dr.
Clarke’s interesting paper on <cite>Maryland
Toleration</cite>. Having simply cited his authorities,
and used them, as he thinks,
fairly, he will be glad to learn, if he can,
the manner in which they meet the challenge
conveyed in the latter portion
of this paper. Mr. Gladstone’s present
object is to say he would be greatly
obliged by a <em>reference</em> to enable him to
trace the “irreverent words” imputed to
him on page 6, as his <cite>Vatican Decrees</cite> have
no page 83, and he is not aware of having
penned such a passage.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">4 Carlton Gardens</span>, <span class="smcap">London</span>, Jan. 24, 1856.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Gladstone is right in disclaiming
the words imputed to him in this instance.
They are, on investigation, found
to be the words of the Rev. Dr. Schaff. The
Messrs. Harper, the American publishers
of Mr. Gladstone’s tracts, are largely responsible
for the mistake, by having inserted
in their publication a tract of Dr.
Schaff, paged in common, and all covered
by the outside title of “<cite>Rome and the
Newest Fashions in Religion. Gladstone</cite>,”
and by the title-page giving the authorship
“By the Right Hon. W. E. Gladstone.”
To a writer making selections as needed
from different portions of this book the
mistake was easy and natural; and
though the authorship of Dr. Schaff’s
<cite>History of the Vatican Decrees</cite> containing
the passage in question is given, it is not
so given as easily to reach the eye, and
is obscured by the introduction of Dr.
Schaff’s tract into a volume under Mr.
Gladstone’s name, and by paging Dr.
Schaff’s <cite>History</cite> in common with Mr.
Gladstone’s <cite>Vaticanism</cite>. On page 83 of
<em>this</em> publication of the Messrs. Harper
the “irreverent words” are found. I
am only too much gratified at Mr. Gladstone’s
disowning them, and hasten, on
my part, to make this correction through
your columns, in which my reply to Mr.
Gladstone on <cite>Maryland Toleration</cite> first
appeared, and to beg his acceptance of
this <i lang="fr">amende honorable</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_35" id="Footnote_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> Those in this country who respect religion, law,
and the peace of society should not be imposed upon
by the aspect of Freemasonry here. The principles
and modes of acting of the society are those we
have described. The application of them depends
wholly on time, place, and circumstances. The ordinary
observer sees nothing in the members of the
craft here but a number of inoffensive individuals,
who belong to a <i lang="fr">soi-disant</i> benevolent association
which, by means of secret signs, enables them to get
out of the clutches of the law, procure employment
and office, and obtain other advantages not possessed
by the rest of their fellow-citizens. But then the
innocent rank and file are the dead weight which
the society employs, on occasion, to aid in compassing
its ulterior designs. Here there are no civil or
religious institutions which stand in their way, and
their mode of action is to sap and mine the morals
of the community, on which society rests, and with
which it must perish. Of what it is capable, if it
seems needful to compassing its ends, any one may
understand by the fiendish murder of William Morgan.
This murder was decided on at a lodge-meeting
directed by Freemason officials, <em>in pursuance
of the rules of the craft</em>, and was perpetrated by
Freemasons bearing a respectable character, who had
never before been guilty of a criminal action, who
were known, yet were never punished nor even tried,
but died a natural death, and who do not appear to
have experienced any loss of reputation for their
foul deed. (See Mr. Thurlow Weed’s recent letter
to the New York <cite>Herald</cite>.)</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_36" id="Footnote_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> Before we proceed to expose the even yet more
hideous loathsomeness of this vile association, a few
words of explanation are necessary. In all we write
we have in view an organization&mdash;its constitution
and motives&mdash;and that only. The individual responsibility
of its several members is a matter for
their own conscience; it is no affair of ours. We
believe that the bulk of the association, all up to the
thirtieth degree, or “Knights of the White Eagle,”
or “Kadosch,” are in complete ignorance of the
hellish criminality of its objects. Even the Rosicrucian
has something to learn; although to have become
that he must have stamped himself with the
mark of Antichrist by the abandonment of his belief
in Christ and in all revealed religion. But the
vast majority, whose numbers, influence, and respectability
the dark leaders use for the furtherance
of their monstrous designs, live and die in complete
ignorance of the real objects and principles of the
craft. We ourselves know an instance of an individual,
now reconciled to the church, who was once a
Master Mason, and who to this moment is in utter
ignorance of them. They are sedulously concealed
from all who have not dispossessed themselves of the
“prejudices of religion and morality.” The author
of the work to which we are indebted for almost all
our documentary evidence mentions the case of one
who had advanced to the high grade of Rosicrucian,
but who, not until he was initiated into the grade
of Kadosch, was completely stunned and horrified
by the demoniacal disclosures poured into his ears.
Most of the Freemasons, however, have joined the
body as a mere philanthropic institution, or on the
lower motive of self-interest. Nor is it possible to
convince these people of the fearful consequences to
which they are contributing. Of course, but few
of these, it is to be hoped, are involved in the full
guilt of the “craft.” Every Catholic who belongs
to it is in mortal sin. For the rest, we cannot but
hope and believe that an overwhelming majority are
innocent of any sinister motives. But it is impossible
to exonerate them entirely. For, first, the
“craft” is now pursuing its operations with such
unblushing effrontery that it is difficult for any but
illiterate people to plead entire ignorance; and
next, no one can, without moral guilt, bind himself
by terrible oaths, for the breaking of which he consents
to be assassinated, to keep inviolable secrets
with the nature of which he is previously unacquainted.
It cannot but be to his everlasting peril
that any one permits himself to be branded with
this “mark of the beast.”</p>

<i lang="la">ratione termini</i>, was admitted&mdash;that is,
movement towards dimensive quantity, as when an
animal or a tree grows in bulk. But bodies acquire
greater bulk by accession of new particles, and this
accession is carried on by <em>local</em> movement. Hence
it seems to us that the <i lang="la">motus ad quantitatem</i> is

et puncta sint etiam infinita in potentia in qualibet
magnitudine, sequitur quod inter quælibet duo
loca sint infinita loca media. Mobile autem infinitatem
mediorum locorum non consumit nisi per
continuitatem motus; quia sicut loca media sunt infinita
in potentia, ita et in motu continuo est accipere
infinita quædam in potentia.&mdash;<cite>Sum. Theol.</cite>, p.

note on this subject&mdash;“more than once, in reading
defences of the Catholic Church, written with the
best intentions, we could not resist a desire that in
the ‘Litanies of the Saints,’ or other prayers of the
church, there might be inserted some such invocation
as this: <i lang="la">A malis advocatis libera nos, Domine</i>.’&mdash;‘From
mischievous advocates, O Lord! deliver
us.’ We say this most earnestly, the more so that
it applies also to ourselves. Many a time, when
preparing our writings, we have experienced a feeling
not unlike that of an advocate fully convinced of
the innocence of the accused, but dreading lest, by
want of clearness or other defect in putting forth
his arguments, he might not only fail to carry conviction
to the mind of the judges, but also prejudice
the cause he wishes to defend. Never, perhaps, is
the necessity of prayer more deeply felt.”</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_188" id="Footnote_188"></a><a href="#FNanchor_188"><span class="label">[188]</span></a> With regard to the powers of the sovereign over
the episcopate we quote the following from the
London <cite>Tablet</cite> for March 27, 1875: “Among other
tremendous stumbling-blocks against the claims for
the Church (of England) by the High Church party
a candid writer in the <cite>Church Herald</cite> is ‘sorely
staggered by the oath of allegiance, according to
which we have the chief pastors of the church declaring
in the most solemn manner that they receive
the spiritualities of their office <em>only</em> from the queen,
and are bishops by her grace only.’”</p>

<p>In connection with the foregoing we cannot refrain
from citing a passage from Marshall, which is
as follows: “Any bishops can only obtain spiritual
jurisdiction in one of two ways&mdash;either by receiving
it from those who already possess it, in which case
their (the English bishops’) search must extend beyond
their own communion, or by imitating the
two lay travellers in China of whom we have somewhere
read, who fancied they should like to be missionaries,
whereupon the one ordained the other, and
was then in turn ordained by <em>him</em>, to the great satisfaction
of both.”</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_190" id="Footnote_190"></a><a href="#FNanchor_190"><span class="label">[190]</span></a> Since writing the above we happened to see the
following case in point, in the <cite>Church Times</cite> of
September 10, 1875, in which a clergyman, signing
himself “a priest, <em>not</em> of the Diocese of Exeter,”
writes a letter of remonstrance against the violent
abuse heaped by “a priest of the Diocese of Exeter”
against the late learned and venerable Vicar of
Morwenstow, Mr. Hawker, who, on the day before
his death, made his submission to the Catholic
Church. From this letter, which contains many
candid and interesting admissions, we quote the following:
“In these days, when we have among us
so many dignitaries and popular preachers of the
Established Church who in their teaching deny all
sacramental truth, while others cannot repeat the
Nicene and Athanasian Creeds without a gloss, and
others again boldly assert that ‘the old religious
ideas expressed in the Apostles’ Creed must be
thrown into afresh form, if they are to retain their
hold on the educated minds of the present generation,
it appears monstrous that a clergyman whose faithful
adhesion to the Prayer Book during a ministry
of forty years was notorious should be denounced
as a ‘blasphemous rogue and a scoundrel’ <em>because</em>
he held opinions which are considered by some individual
members of either church as denoting ‘a
Roman at heart,’ or, in the exercise of a liberty
granted to everyone, thought fit to correspond with
influential members of the Church of Rome.”</p>

Rome endured before being able to appoint bishops
to independent Spanish America, with her ease in
establishing the hierarchy in the United States.
Yet the Spaniards and Loyalists, who sometimes
forgot that political differences should never interfere
with religious unity, might have found a precedent
for this aversion in the case of their northern
brethren. In a sketch of the church in the United
States, written by Bishop Carroll in 1790, it is said
that “during the whole war there was not the least
communication between the Catholics of America
and their bishop, who was the vicar-apostolic of
the London district. To his spiritual jurisdiction
were subject the United States; but whether he
would hold no correspondence with a country which
he, perhaps, considered in a state of rebellion, or
whether a natural indolence and irresolution restrained
him, the fact is he held no kind of intercourse
with priest or layman in this part of his
charge.”&mdash;B. U. Campbell “Memoirs, etc. of the

of one of the distinguished Irish families which
took refuge in Spain from the persecutions of the
English government. He was born in Chili of a
Chilian mother. His father had been captain-general
of what was called the kingdom of Chili, and was
afterwards Viceroy of Peru. The younger O’Higgins
was a very superior man, taking a principal part
in asserting the independence of his native land, of
which he became the first president; but unfortunately
he died in 1823, a few months before the arrival
of the apostolic mission.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
